13 2018-10-04 23:58:11 I'm going to guess the plot.
Rambo has moved to the south west and is working on a ranch/reservation farm. 
That ranch is being targeted for a pipeline going through it by the government/oil company and Rambo helps the natives fight off the private security firm they send in.

15 2018-10-04 23:57:58 I actually think the better argument here is around economic policy.  Tax is part of the price increase but arguably the bigger driver is the weakening of the NZD against the USD, which drives up USD-denominated oil prices for us kiwis.

You think she cares about women? About Blacks? She's a master manipulator. A charlatan. A snake oil salesman.

42 2018-10-04 23:56:49 I hope she pulls ahead but I don't think She's going to.
People are still mad about how she handled the oil protests and her opponent is doing a real good job tar and feathering her for endorsing Hillary (even though shes a Democrat, so duh?).

With a complete pattern in place price is behaving as you'd want. Whether it makes a last lunge towards the monthly channel or not just above is not of huge importance considering the downside potential opening up. 66 is the first major level of note.

58 2018-10-04 23:53:43 It seems odd to me that we own it and are stalling ourselves. Not a good sign for the oil companies.  3rd largest reserves in the world and we create our own road blocks.  A movie will be made of this one day. @Lenoregalickkay
59 2018-10-04 23:53:36 It’s so sad that even though Nigeria is considered the oil giant of Africa, our Sustainable Development Index is one of the lowest even lower than that of BotswanaImagine my disbelief when I found out we were 150 out of 156 countries

2) Trades w/ a 25% YTW
3) Majority of Bond holders signed pact they would only negotiate with company as a group - which is why illiquid.

82 2018-10-04 23:50:05 You are mistaken. It's the US that has been supporting terrorism across the ME. The US has supported Al Qaeda in Libya and Syria in the attempted overthrow of their governments. The US also never bombed ISIS's oil trade with Turkey and ensured that ISIS's funding remained.
83 2018-10-04 23:49:59 I like to make a mask with white clay after washing and exfoliating the face. The white clay has the pH very close to the skin, it clears, strips the oil without dehydration and I'll take a very sharp pruning shears.

91 2018-10-04 23:49:22 So I put the box of tar oil into my entryway so it wouldnt freeze in the garage, and didnt realize the lid wasnt properly on. I also didn't realize either me or the dogs knocked it over on our way to go for a run.

94 2018-10-04 23:49:19 Norways green initiative is that it produces some of the cleanest oil and gas when it drills for it. So less pollution than others.  However it doesn't stop 6.2% of its Government Pension Fund > $1 trillion dollars investing in oil elsewhere.

110 2018-10-04 23:46:22 Unless you escrow deliverables and have unassailable and completely objective acceptance criteria, there's no point in it. Smart contract makes sense for conveyance of value triggered by measurable and determinate events—e.g., oil well flow rate yield exceeds N%.

124 2018-10-04 23:43:59 - Norway dredges up more oil per capita than most other countries in the world

- Norway drills at the edge of the polar ice cap,
125 2018-10-04 23:43:59 To be fair, all the old TV chefs told us to add oil to the water so that the pasta doesn’t stick together and so that the sauces stick to it.
126 2018-10-04 23:43:55 i got a essential oil machine :-)
127 2018-10-04 23:43:40 Crude oil pipelines are clunky, cumbersome and inefficient....  Just use Train Lines like everyone else; they'd save a GOOD AMOUNT of money utilizing trains(shipping cost lower than to install/maintain pipelines). Let's just be logistics-logical here.

148 2018-10-04 23:41:56 Is it really efficient enough to rid us of our dependence on oil? Could you point me in the right direction to find out about that sort of thing?
149 2018-10-04 23:41:50 Plus crude oil prices went up to 120$ as well during UPA. Fact is NDA has had it relatively easy in terms of crude prices but fuel prices have been much higher-they're simply unable to keep their electoral promise on fuel prices

241 2018-10-04 23:29:52 It’s called a bubble. The market is inflated by the record stock buybacks from the tax cut for the wealthy people and corporations. 

If fuel prices go up 20+%, that doesn’t help normal Americans. It helps the oil and gas industry. 

You need to start thinking of regular people.

250 2018-10-04 23:28:41 This is an exceptionally foolish tweet because it focuses only on fish and ignores the far more valuable oil and gas.  

Australia played the same dirty trick on Timor Leste during the negotiations in which it grabbed an unfair share of the oil and gas field between them.

254 2018-10-04 23:27:52 Could you ask the people funding your tweets why we are still paying more for gas at the pump than when oil was double the price per barrel, but many of us working in the oil and gas industry are still living on a wage rollback from the crash?

289 2018-10-04 23:21:56 With the oil price slowly reaching  $88 a barrel we can be rest assured there will be another fuel hike next month and it will be more severe. Brace yourselves, the shit is about to hit the tank!
290 2018-10-04 23:21:52 Well, maybe not full on, but close. It could be worse... I’m hoping when I go for my oil change, they will be able to fix it under that extra warranty thing

300 2018-10-04 23:20:45 Dishonest Donnie hires dishonest people to work for him. Why should we believe he would nominate an honest Supreme Court Associate Justice? The snake oil makes them just slippery enough to escape. Put an asterisk on everyone in this administration. They lie.

369 2018-10-04 23:12:23 Sheikhs are spending their oil money. Greed is everywhere even India. Have you seen rich Hindu businessman extravagant lifestyles with huge bungalow and exotic cars. Islam and Hinduism is against luxury lifestyles but people don’t listen.
370 2018-10-04 23:12:19 Try olbas oil, put a few drops on a tissue & put it inside your pillow case, really helps at night when trying to sleep.

378 2018-10-04 23:11:09 They have a lot of oil that they won't use it for their people tho
379 2018-10-04 23:11:08 my dad's never had to remind me to get my oil change, so I guess I'm not a real twitter girl
380 2018-10-04 23:10:55 I have stated some for years now!  Build an upgrade in every province.   Our country is then totally self-sufficient for oil & gas.   Exports become very simple & all provinces prosper.

384 2018-10-04 23:10:20 @SangerNYT British Petroleum is formed out of Anglo-Iranian, future president George H.W. Bush received his first oil company, as a gift from his father, out of the deal as well.

386 2018-10-04 23:10:16 At the scene there was a large amount of burnt oil, and as far as the motive... Monokuma said he would release a ton of snakes if something didn’t happen
387 2018-10-04 23:10:08 #Ayurveda’s ancient texts have many positive things to say about the benefits of #abhyanga, the age-old Ayurvedic practice of self-massage with warm oil. If only they’d added a few lines about how to avoid gunking up your towels, bathtub, and pipes!
388 2018-10-04 23:10:07 Fenugreek. In any form... Oil or Powder. But sometimes nothing works if the body just has low supply. Lactation differs from female to female. From my little experience with breastfeeding mums.

391 2018-10-04 23:09:51 I'm not sure what your point is.  Norway is not a socialist country; it is a free market economy.  It's wealth comes from OIL and GAS.

393 2018-10-04 23:09:08 After this morning's drop I got sidetracked with oil and ES but I agree I think we're setting up for more pullback..natgas takes its time though sometimes I wouldn't be surprised if we spend abit more time consolidating first. I'm short via dgaz not futures so I'm being patient
394 2018-10-04 23:08:57 A real leader in the Senate would relay to Murkowski that a no vote might result in a no vote on ANWAR oil fields.Shut that shit down and your constituents can kiss their oil royalty checks goodbye. Texas has plenty of oil.
395 2018-10-04 23:08:32 Isn't it joke of the Decade? If they have the sensitivity they should have done proper planning before demonitisation. They should have supported AP to form the capital. They shouldn't have raised the prices at all. When the oil prices internationally going down why they went up
396 2018-10-04 23:08:32 If Kavanaugh gets his way. .no Social security. .no Medicaid. .

399 2018-10-04 23:08:10 Elon's point valid..by doing nothing about short sellers FUD etc. the SEC is defacto supporting them with inaction. There are two teams on the field. If referee (SEC) only calls penalties on Tesla and not on the shorts thats a rigged game that favors Big Oil, Big Auto, Big Media
400 2018-10-04 23:08:01 Islam is a unified socio-political system with a militarized wing, an educational wing, a religious wing, and enormous oil wealth.
401 2018-10-04 23:07:59 I've been stuck with my mom, who's been deep in conversation with an essential oil seller she's never even met before today, for the past 45 minutes now. Please help.
402 2018-10-04 23:07:59 Seeing bob lutz and all this idiots are really not helpful. Trump does one thing well he keeps saying the narrative over and over again. Tesla will eliminate oil and leads in autonomy. Your are selling the best product go for test drives with Phil LeBeau go on John Oliver.
403 2018-10-04 23:07:47 That would also be tasty. You could do part oil and part butter as well.

407 2018-10-04 23:07:43 Well I do it in a really plain and lazy way, I just roast them in a pot with butter (I like it when it’s a bit burnt) and I have my sriracha hot sauce mixed with sesame oil on the side as my dipping sauce to eat with a bowl of rice (my Asian side likes it that way lol) BUT —>

409 2018-10-04 23:07:29 No, it's not acceptable that the price of crude oil is going through the roof, YTD its up 50%, what's your point?
410 2018-10-04 23:07:28 that's okay, we will clean up your plastic trash, lead water, oil spills, abuse of any kind and anything else you don't care about ...
411 2018-10-04 23:07:07 If every other business in the country esp coal, oil, big agriculture, and pharmaceuticals can meddle in politics with money as "free speech" then Patagonia should be allowed to say they care about national parks omfg. I would love to work somewhere like Patagonia

417 2018-10-04 23:06:14 So happy my professor cancelled class tonight. My eyes are literally bleeding from trying to learn how to oil paint 
418 2018-10-04 23:05:36 My mom sent me to the store to get cooking oil and I came home with oil and a shit load of Halloween decorations 
419 2018-10-04 23:05:09 $200 oil is bullshit.  $120 brent is the bigger worry.  baby steps.. that'll be enough to crash things but not in a strong dollar environment.
420 2018-10-04 23:04:58 And every 10 to 15 years we throw a tantrum and demand the govt take control to force the oil to specific areas

And then throw a tantrum when the govt suggests things like the NEP to accomplish that.

Common denominator being tantrums.

432 2018-10-04 23:02:55 Idk what my old roommate put in the bottle labeled “sesame oil” but it is VERY SPICY and I was NOT PREPARED
433 2018-10-04 23:02:52 Ripple’s relationship to XRP is akin Chevron’s relationship to oil. We have a lot of it, we believe it’s a superior technology and we support its many uses — for billions of reasons. But we don’t have all of it, we don’t control it and we aren’t it.

437 2018-10-04 23:02:31 What with the dollar beer that for some reason costs $43 something a 28 and the 10 cent cheaper gas being raised 10 by the oil companys I’m sure glad Toronto has less councillors
438 2018-10-04 23:02:31 Last night i drenched myself in an oil for anxiety without realizing it’s also an aphrodisiac.... 
439 2018-10-04 23:02:11 As long as I didn’t watch the news, it was good.
I saw my first ever lesser goldfinch and bought thistle seed for the.
I got the majority of my report done.
I bought CBD oil at the dog food store.
440 2018-10-04 23:01:56 Are the incorrect answers randomly generated? I would suggest that the incorrect answers come from the same block or set as the correct one if they are to make it harder to eliminate several answers on the basis of minor art clues like hedrons or phyrexian oil

443 2018-10-04 23:01:39 I need to get my hands on some burdock oil. Idk if they sell it in the states like how it’s everywhere in Kharkiv.

448 2018-10-04 23:01:27 @lisamurkowski , Trump opening up oil production and gas helps Alaska. As Senator of Alaska, I am sure you appreciate his efforts. Obama was fixed on reducing petroleum products production during his term. Republicans must stay in power.
449 2018-10-04 23:01:11 Imagine how much people would be spending on what really matters - food, clean water, and a happy life - if they didn't have to fork out money to power/oil companies that do nothing but pollute this planet for no reason.
450 2018-10-04 23:01:07 Oil paint? People stopped using that years ago. Where did they even get it? ( I am exaggerating, but seriously oil paint?)
451 2018-10-04 23:00:51 They will need to fill up another day, but lucky the guys at Big Oil don’t know this and will completely cave in to all their demands.
452 2018-10-04 23:00:43 Making brownies with peppermint oil tonight and I am so excited
453 2018-10-04 23:00:30 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

458 2018-10-04 22:59:31 Murkowski is definitely looking for leverage. She wants unlimited oil drilling in Alaska. She come across as aloof, but she gets what she wants.

461 2018-10-04 22:58:56 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 2) IMO if RU hackers get so much coverage , why not give equal time to US Religious groups members that claim near Tax Exempt Status while selling Diamonds,Gold, R.E., Insurance,Oil,Weapons, etc. ? Let's hope Taxpayers get all the facts by Tax time, right ?
462 2018-10-04 22:58:28 Crude oil ended 2% lower at $84.58 a barrel, this means high prices remained in place for while. As the deadline for #Iran  oil Sanctions approaching

465 2018-10-04 22:58:16 Here is where your argument weakens. Every company has short sellers it’s part of the system and sometimes a good way to hedge. In this instance and many others they are being used to try and destroy a company but it’s usually guided by outside forces aka Big Oil or OEM’s ...

472 2018-10-04 22:57:20 The point seems to be to not buy petrol tomorrow (and only tomorrow) to own Big Oil.

474 2018-10-04 22:57:10 I don’t use anything heavy handed. Which is why I get annoyed when I get my hair done and I’m like you can’t put all that ish in my fine hair. Leave in mixed with a little Argan oil then my cream styler and that’s it

481 2018-10-04 22:56:14 So I guess youre ready to admit Hillary is innocent also. and that Bush lied and that there were NO wepons of mass destructions in Iraq and Afghanistan? It was all for greed and oil.

Good luck COMMIE Republicans!
489 2018-10-04 22:55:02 Have you gotten your oil changed yet btw?
490 2018-10-04 22:54:55 Wet is related to LIQUID, not water. So oily in relation to oil or greasy in relation to grease isnt the same. We're not talking GETTING water wet. Were talking it BEING wet. Thats the disconnect.

492 2018-10-04 22:54:41 Studies done by Johns Hopkins have shown that long use of fish oil has cause the growth of small gill like features on some humans.
493 2018-10-04 22:54:33 What started out as an oil change has ended up as me here at the Kia dealership picking up a rental. Nothing seems to simple anymore.
494 2018-10-04 22:54:32 What are u laughing about? The soaring record debt? Oil & gas industry confidence at all time low?

the sebaceous filaments (?) or gunk stuck in the pores on my nose were gone since first use, they’ve been evicted
502 2018-10-04 22:53:47 Gas prices are going up because greedy millionaire oil companies have exported in excess to make huge profits and then deplete reserves for the US. Then on top of their big pay date, they profit more from us by raising prices #oilprice #gopgreed #VoteThemOut

505 2018-10-04 22:53:39 Nah, Doofus, ISIS hasn't been "decimated" -- just moved to Afghanistan, Libya and parts of Africa. Walking away from the Iran deal didn't cost them a cent, but it did raise the price of oil which puts MORE money into Tehran's coffers. Why can't you be honest with America?

510 2018-10-04 22:53:25 After you flooded my beloved FL coast with oil which severely hurt my income & my killed my sea life, I won’t even buy gas at a BP station. Even in a hurricane when gas was scarce, I refused to buy from BP.

541 2018-10-04 22:49:32 US oil companies can be benefited from the price rise. EU countries and China will be the main losers. US can improve its balance of trade through exporting oil to other countries & at the same time improve its unemployment rate.
542 2018-10-04 22:49:29 Other than Ag export; Raw mineral export; arms export to someone which definitely not NATO/ EU/ unknown industry like Lada? (It’s technically an oil dictatorship).
Russia have to play dirty in the UK because they’re less reliant on Russians oil & gas than other Europeans states.

551 2018-10-04 22:48:08 Sadly the only thing that would stop  the @SenateGOP from confirming is if big oil and the @nra came out against him. @JeffFlake can’t find the courage to do the right thing. Vote no and move on to a better suited conservative judge.
552 2018-10-04 22:47:56 Looks delicious but I would use olive oil instead of canola oil.

561 2018-10-04 22:46:36 1. Using coconut oil as a face moisturizer

This is a controversial one concidering coconut oil is the right now. By all means, keep cooking with and   rubbing it in your hair and all over your dry body bits. But using it as a face moisturizer will only clog your pores

nashville: you are not good, but mostly because i also do the same thing as you

texas: you are crazy, why aren’t you working on your dad’s oil rig like me? freebird!
582 2018-10-04 22:44:20 Got my mail in ballot today. I have a handful of amendments to research, the rest is filled in and ready to go, including: opposing the support of oil drilling. Yeah, fuck that.
583 2018-10-04 22:44:18 Also love - LOVE - the scare tactic-filled fliers currently being mailed to me every day by the "ordinary Americans" who want Prop 112 to die. You know, the proposition that states oil & gas companies cant drill new wells within 2,500 ft of peoples houses and protected land.

593 2018-10-04 22:43:17 Tobacco Beer and Oil money were all big in that era.
594 2018-10-04 22:43:11 I don't mind the taste of the oil just the hardness of the shell.
595 2018-10-04 22:43:00 "U.S. crude oil exports of nearly 1.8 million barrels a day were the top petroleum product export in the first half of 2018."
596 2018-10-04 22:42:49 LOL!!!! Oh no. Never heard of that....mine is this gigantic oil filled gelatinous covered pill (deep, cold water fish) that I swallow fast so I don't have to think about it breaking....arrrgh! And no-spit it out-I would.
597 2018-10-04 22:42:48 Check your local mall for one of those kiosks that make t-shirts.
598 2018-10-04 22:42:47 thanks but i already spent time on the phone today with customer service. sorry but i dont believe the consistent product supply, i used to buy Quinn oil, havent seen it in 2-3 months, and most of the strains i tried so far since march are not even on the website anymore.
599 2018-10-04 22:42:44 And could you please check the oil with your dipstick?
600 2018-10-04 22:42:41 I have sore throat, it's palm oil I need
601 2018-10-04 22:42:36 what’s good for soothing your scalp besides tea tree oil
602 2018-10-04 22:42:23 Bought and essential oil defuser for work. Lavender vanilla is the scent. It smells so good.
I bought this to try to help myself not be so stressed or anxious at work. It's helping.

605 2018-10-04 22:42:04 Yo. For me it’s more a subtle thing - I take 3-4 drops of 5% cbd oil and I wouldn’t say I really notice it, but I do when I don’t take it now
606 2018-10-04 22:42:00 Put Frankincense essential oil on sun and age spots three times daily to help lighten.
607 2018-10-04 22:41:46 Are you para-dropped in India by #Pappu to increase  #Pidis in his gang after 2013 when #PetrolPrice was Rs.81-82 in spite of UPA issuing oil bonds instead of paying up for fuel!!
608 2018-10-04 22:41:43 My boss is doing the right thing with the company tax benefit. She is raising pay rates and giving us bonuses. I will get heating oil this year :)
609 2018-10-04 22:41:42 OPEC cannot make up shortfall? I thought Russia was the #1 oil producer in the world. Maybe they can 'distribute' their oil thru OPEC.

613 2018-10-04 22:40:36 @PnPCBC All this talk about compensation for the Dairy Cartel but still nothing for the oil industry which is dying directly due to Trudeau's govt policies Nice to hear what they have to say on that

618 2018-10-04 22:40:00 Me starting my car up and driving to u is spending bread already. My gas burning, engine running, oil getting mutted. Oh shit and my fuckin tires getting worn out. That’s 5bs right there boo. Now bend over
619 2018-10-04 22:39:47 (ex. the coup in 2002, the multiple Nationwide strikes led by opposition leaders). The economy isn't failing because the gov. didn't think about investing money outside of the oil industry (which is false). It is necessarily a more complex issue than faulty gov policy Cont.

623 2018-10-04 22:38:42 A question about fish oil pills.  So I have the chewable kind where when you bite it, the oil comes out.  My question is do I have to go on and swallow the empty shell?
624 2018-10-04 22:38:32 Stopped to get my oil changed. Mechanic commented on my @CriticalRole sticker. "We are everywhere." We really are.
625 2018-10-04 22:38:31 Lea County receives vital education funding from the oil and natural gas industry! 
626 2018-10-04 22:38:27 Think oil prices were around the 40 buck mark then.
627 2018-10-04 22:38:24 The box let's the oil from cooking the pizza drain to the side leaving a crisp cracker crust. I Officially want to kiss you. It is official.
628 2018-10-04 22:38:22 The difference is that Russia is an oil dictatorship (and oil just bounced back to ~75$/ so they’re is doing fine) they have the flexibility to throw Russians (including ethnic Russians) under the bus if they want to.
629 2018-10-04 22:38:20 Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

635 2018-10-04 22:37:35 Clearly there isn’t oil there or we’d have invaded it

646 2018-10-04 22:35:58 Well it’s a very simple thing, where ‘the people’ feel the ruling party has imposed any candidate against their will, they should just keep mute and wait for 2019. Then go all out and vote for an opposition candidate for that seat at the general elections.

653 2018-10-04 22:34:30 #Iran's most important customers of crude oil:
- China: Imports of Iranian oil are declining since months
- India: refuses to buy oil from Iran
- SouthKorea: refuses to buy oil from Iran
- Japan: refuses to buy oil from Iran
- EU will most likely join, because they fear sanctions
654 2018-10-04 22:34:24 I swear by coconut oil
655 2018-10-04 22:34:18 The tax cuts were good, except now we are putting more than we are saving on taxes in our gas tanks. A barrel of oil is almost $30. more than on Election Day. This needs to get fixed or it wasn’t worth the savings. #GetItFixed

663 2018-10-04 22:32:59 Ricin is in the seeds.  The seeds if eaten (chewed) can be lethal after 4-8 seeds.  Whole seeds can pass through the digestive tract (I wouldn't try it). The mashed seeds after extracting the oil are full of the ricin compound.

668 2018-10-04 22:32:49 Asked my dad to borrow his jack so I can change my oil and he says “you don’t have one?” The only smartass response I had was “now I do.”

670 2018-10-04 22:32:21 to the contrary:India's quite a difficult place for manufacturing. hence the drive by some of current govt's for indigenisation by using high $ value deals. reg sanctions:-india has been purchasing oil from Iran,always. surely there must be some give& take behind closed doors.

673 2018-10-04 22:31:58 @kathygriffin Read the F-uck you tweet.  What a lucid and well reasoned retort.  You must have burned the midnight oil before you came up with that beauty.  Perhaps with a little more time you could have perfected your thought by adding, "and the horse you rode in on."

The more you wash your hair the more oil your scalp thinks it needs ACV breaks it down.

707 2018-10-04 22:27:55 That is part of it but oil explains an awful lot! Who has it & who needs it! Currently we r now the worlds largest producer so we can push back! We shld have kept 50k troops in Iraq & used them 2 neuter Iran! Obama was hapless! What would last 4 long run? Between US/Russia/China?

730 2018-10-04 22:25:04 There should be more NO votes for an unfit candidate picked by the biggest snake oil salesman in history. Who paid Kavanaugh's debt, what agreement does he have with the President who faces serious jeopardy because of his own questionable crimes. Brett is a liar. Under oath.

773 2018-10-04 22:20:32 #ukog same fractured basin, same resevoir, same oil. Different price. When BP/Total/ExxonMobil buy UKOG and ANGS in one fell swoop the price they will have to pay for the acerage will be the same for each company. Hence from here UKOG will do twice as well as ANGS.

806 2018-10-04 22:16:06 i came to get my oil changed and figured it’d be super quick since i had an appointment but they just told me it’d be about an hour and my phone is on 9% 
807 2018-10-04 22:16:06 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!

815 2018-10-04 22:15:22 #ukog and ANGS comparisons given the sheer quantity of oil in the Weald should be based on
acerage positions IMO as they have both accessed the same resevoir. Market capitalisation is used to normalise the valuation per Sq Km. On this basis UKOG is undervalued by 50% cf ANGS..

858 2018-10-04 22:10:14 Great podcast. Not seeing the organization you mentioned that tests Fish Oil Supplements on that list. Wondering if Nordic Naturals is tested by them as I know years ago you recommended their Fish Oil.

863 2018-10-04 22:09:41 They all want to see solar and forget that you need oil to make components for solar panels.
864 2018-10-04 22:09:40 Don’t roast them, grill them! Slice in half and cook in olive oil on a grill pan. Add salt, pepper, lemon juice, crushed garlic, and red pepper flakes. Cook caramelized and serve hot.
865 2018-10-04 22:09:40 
866 2018-10-04 22:09:39 I put oil on the floor to watch my dog slide when she runs to me....I ended up in the corner while spreading it out & had no escape. So, yeah. That back fired.
867 2018-10-04 22:09:32 Beautiful Olives in garlic and chili oil with an exquisite Pinot Noir and Crostini for dipping. What’s wrong with you?

870 2018-10-04 22:09:21 Woosaa, found a steamable bag of grilled corn with diced red/green peppers, add some olive oil, spicy tomato basil sauce, mix and let simma
871 2018-10-04 22:09:18 I’ve never been taught that and I’m a first gen Italian-American. Salt yes, oil no.
872 2018-10-04 22:09:13 That is the reason the various oil kings of the world give for using MSP. I've seen the Saudi 747 on the ramp by the Delta hangars on 494 many times.
873 2018-10-04 22:09:04 I need to change my oil tomorrow and of course it's going to rain tonight

880 2018-10-04 22:08:01 How does Angola have a debt crisis. With all the diamonds and oil and shit.
881 2018-10-04 22:07:49 We will check the stores tomorrow to see the amount of Sales, Oshio has spoken already.
882 2018-10-04 22:07:14 Someone threw a bottle of Omega 3 at me. Luckily the injuries were only super fish oil.
883 2018-10-04 22:07:10 Oil money is the problem of Nigeria as nation. When Nigerians start paying taxes, they will  demand more from their leaders! You can’t steal tax money like you steal oil money”
884 2018-10-04 22:06:56 right time for America to sanction Russias entire oil and banking sector. then lets see how much of a brave face Russia can put on
885 2018-10-04 22:06:46 Watching #MTP with @chucktodd reminds me of when mom used to force us to take Castor oil. @MSNBC
886 2018-10-04 22:06:33 I have such a crush on Zooey Deschanel that I just got a hard on watching a video of her talking about extra virgin olive oil #noshame
887 2018-10-04 22:06:15 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.

889 2018-10-04 22:06:10 Total yum  hummus is great and so healthy, I like to add garlic for antioxidant heart health, lemon juice for vitamin c, olive oil,. fresh herbs, basil, olives etc the sky's the limit! Delicious. With toasted pitta bread, or mixed with water as a fabulous mixed salad dressing

891 2018-10-04 22:06:02 Trump's Iranian sanctions increase oil prices, enrich Kremlin coffers and undermine moderate allies in the middle east
892 2018-10-04 22:05:59 I doubt any of those would be in line to do her. They are particular about using their dipstick to check her oil.
893 2018-10-04 22:05:53 If you were trying to do maintenance on the down low so your apartment complex doesn't catch you, like changing engine oil is the most you can do. Everything else requires costlier equipment to do properly. 

I've change brake pads with my dad w/o proper gear & Hmmmm hmmmm
894 2018-10-04 22:05:37 He has confronted Russia by addressing the EU's dependence on Russia Oil & Gas, via their N1 & N2 pipelines bypassing eastern Europe and Russia using this energy weapon on Europe as well. In fact, no President has done more to confront the Russians since Ronald Reagan.
895 2018-10-04 22:05:25 Uh, parsley, shallots, olive oil, lemon, and capers, hellOooooo 
896 2018-10-04 22:05:10 Tomamos y comimos toda la tarde, Argentina Oil y Gas te amo
897 2018-10-04 22:05:01 Maybe yes, maybe no. Until we figure out how to get off oil, it's still  cheaper to use a pipeline than to continue with trucking and rail. And less emissions. Aren't you for less emissions? Then what's the problem?
898 2018-10-04 22:04:46 Don’t oil the bots

901 2018-10-04 22:04:11 BREAKING: In a major victory for the hemp industry, California has legalized hemp farming! Beginning January 1, 2019, California farmers can legally grow industrial hemp, and produce hemp seed, oil, fiber & extract, thanks to legislation signed by Governor Jerry Brown on Sunday.
902 2018-10-04 22:04:09 I have sprayed everything down with bleach water, and then again with a combo of vinegar and alcohol mixed with tea tree oil, peppermint, and eucalyptus. I do think I have a sachet of dried lavender I can stuff in there too
903 2018-10-04 22:03:57 Gm maintenance plan is a joke. 3500$ for oil changes no synthetic for denali diesel. And no top ups on DEF fluid. Nice ride but maintenance plan is a rip off. Next trucks a ford.
904 2018-10-04 22:03:54 Is it true they had to oil her down and use ratchet straps to squeeze her through the cell doors?

907 2018-10-04 22:03:28 All set to get my anti-inflammatoire, immune boosting on but this eucalyptus oil has fennel in it  now I have to sleep with clogged sinuses and a sore throat. And convince @Monoprix to accept the return. Kill. Me. Now.
908 2018-10-04 22:02:52 Does he use CBD oil?
909 2018-10-04 22:02:17 JUST IN: Trump on verge of shutting down Canada's largest export leaving Canada with no place to sell oil. We will bring Canada to it's knees with out the USMCA.
910 2018-10-04 22:02:09 thank you for trying ... No GMOs? ... No Canola Oil? ...
911 2018-10-04 22:01:54 Sure is ! Scientific ESL & geopolitical oil $ limits, & an inconveniently wide earth orbit.
912 2018-10-04 22:01:50 I'll take the Infinity durags & some coconut oil please
913 2018-10-04 22:01:39 Clove oil, then some whisky , works a treat, tooth pain is the worst 
914 2018-10-04 22:01:37 And they’re fried in sunflower oil?! Fuck yeah I’ll hit up amazon. Thank you 
915 2018-10-04 22:01:29 Unfortunately there’s. it much value in snake oil
916 2018-10-04 22:01:28 Sir, @oil_shaeikh. 

Jamb question: 

1. How market?


917 2018-10-04 22:01:27 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but they go out fast.
918 2018-10-04 22:01:26 Can you get some dried lavender to put between your pillow and pillowcase...lavender oil also would work, but whole lavender works best for me.  Or Chamomile (use with caution, can be an allergen)
919 2018-10-04 22:01:23 Remember when we woke up to find the downstairs neighbours almost burnt the house down? Turns out they're now repainting the downstairs apartment due to all the smoke damage! And they didn't tell us, so now we're choking on oil paint fumes :|
920 2018-10-04 22:01:23 Another day, another defeat. Got approved for a delivery thing, so went to get an overdue oil change. They say my battery and brakes are about to die, which is five hundred plus dollars I just don't have. Now I don't even know if I should try the delivery gig.
921 2018-10-04 22:01:15 Have you looked into cbd oil?
922 2018-10-04 22:01:07 This bitch really sprayed oil sheen on a man w/ a bald head  that shit been already shiny  everybody tryna figure out why i laughing 
923 2018-10-04 22:01:02 Such a burden to have. And so much discovered since 2014. If only Scotland had an oil fund... PS welcome back.
924 2018-10-04 22:01:01 Girls who get in the car & just go 
give me anxiety

Ok fuck checking the oil, tires, lights, air pressure, emergency kit, gas, speed limit
925 2018-10-04 22:00:40 They aren't two of the world's largest oil producers for nothing. Both countries know which side their bread is buttered on,although China has a long way to go to catch up with the US as far as emissions go.
926 2018-10-04 22:00:39 Truly interesting. How do you sell the Country's oil's reserves? Pretty suspicious, isn't it? There must have been a very persuasive good reason.
927 2018-10-04 22:00:27 I’ve used Evening Primrose Oil supplements to help with suicidal ideations brought on by my period. Literal life-saver, in my experience.

929 2018-10-04 22:00:24 I use CBD oil to control my anxiety. Well, not right now, 'cause pregnant, but before then. It weaned me off my Rx that made me gain over 80lb in a year (which heightened my depression). Give it a go!
930 2018-10-04 22:00:23 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
931 2018-10-04 22:00:17 WHY is this a problem exclusive to white western countries? Why? And in the meantime, before your Utopian world of "never oil", just what do you suggest we heat our homes with?  I hope you have time for Joe Public's questions.
932 2018-10-04 22:00:02 Gonna hazard a guess that the bertoli was used in the frying pan as a cooking oil. #chefnitro
933 2018-10-04 21:59:55 @OldSpice I saw your beard oil on display today...it would be nice if it actually contained carrier and essential oils. Also, the balm looks horrible.  Stick to soaps and stuff.
934 2018-10-04 21:59:52 I need an oil change 
935 2018-10-04 21:59:29 oil on my hands, money in my pocket
936 2018-10-04 21:59:21 Indian refineries have announced that they won't buy any more oil from #Iran.
One Asian oil importer after another are complying to avoid being cut off from the American financial system when restrictions on Iranian supplies take effect in November.
937 2018-10-04 21:59:08 Snake oil deffo
938 2018-10-04 21:58:56 I use olive oil rather than butter- but you can’t mess it up!
939 2018-10-04 21:58:53 How come I don't see oil wells in the background.  That would be better representation of your polices.
940 2018-10-04 21:58:53 My checks are soaked in coconut oil
941 2018-10-04 21:58:47 Actually, everyone who works there drenches their hair with oil before shifts
942 2018-10-04 21:58:43 The money comes from OFFSHORE OIL and GAS REVENUES, YOU progressive socialists hate OFFSHORE OIL PRODUCTION. PERHAPS you want to borrow a billionaire year to fund it. Vote for balancing the budget, government owns enough land. @Yvette4congress @Pearce4NM @MickRich4Senate
943 2018-10-04 21:58:39 Really,immense harm had been done to our industries,many disapearing to Eastern Eu ,our coal,post,local services,fishing,oil,partly taken over at least,plenty more,the raping of uk.i voted to go in,big mistake, treaded with rest of booming rest of the world,our sales to EU down .
944 2018-10-04 21:58:37 I get this. I've been waiting for the US to invade my face for its oil since puberty.
945 2018-10-04 21:58:33 If you take just one thing from this brilliant #Lyme documentary, learn the proper and correct way to remove ticks!!! Great advice, tick twister tool also v good. Ignore sham advice like peppermint oil or waiting for it to drop off etc #LymeEire #LivingWithLymeDisease #RTE
946 2018-10-04 21:58:29 My lovely old peeler finally failed. So I bought one of these...
Peel spuds with one side of it, bowl, little salt, loads of pepper, tbs oil, mix together, flat on a tray, 180 10mins, turn over half way. And you could add chillies, or carrot, or anything! Beetroot's gorgeous.
947 2018-10-04 21:58:26 My mom attempted to say “maybe we should hold off on an oil change in case it’s not really worth it to fix everything else on this thing” WHAT DO YOU MEAN???? ITS LITERALLY ALL I GOT
948 2018-10-04 21:58:25 Facial wash (pm only)
Face oil (am-pm) 
Moisturizer (am-pm)
Use sunscreen (if needed)
Try clear skin diet methods 
949 2018-10-04 21:58:17 Calling yourself progressive is so convenient. You can get away with giving tax breaks to Big Oil multinationals just like ta-dah!
950 2018-10-04 21:58:11 @realDonaldTrump When are you going to go after the real terrorists ruining this country....the Texas oil terrorists.
951 2018-10-04 21:57:55 My brother cooked 4eggs last night with a tablespoon of thc oil. That man is still high 
952 2018-10-04 21:57:52 Another perspective:
The production and subsequent burning of Alberta oil in H1 is, I believe, around 250Mt. 

Alberta could save the planet the 6Mt you mention by dropping production by ~2%...
953 2018-10-04 21:57:50 CBD Oil,  made from the HEMP plant and has none of the hallucinogenic THC in it,  is great for anxiety, depression, PTSD, and works great for ED increasing blood flow, 4 the ladies it increases lubrication, sensitivity. Natural remedies rather than chemical.
954 2018-10-04 21:57:48 so sometimes i put a few drops of essential oils in my shower cause it smells nice and aromatherapy n shit but i used way too much lemongrass oil and now my bathroom smells like a woodland fairy took a shit in it
955 2018-10-04 21:57:39  oil salesmen, are back.
956 2018-10-04 21:57:28 Oil exploration workers in Taranaki are not facing an immediate transition. Existing permits run out until 2046. The idea that jobs are being lost now or will be in the near future because of the oil and gas ban is industry spin. And it’s not true.
957 2018-10-04 21:57:17 Never pop a zit it causes inflammation. Use tea tree oil or baking soda paste on it overnight
958 2018-10-04 21:57:12 Which cleansing oil?
959 2018-10-04 21:57:02 Remember every man woman and child in Alaska gets a check each year from the oil industry.
960 2018-10-04 21:56:39 OIL (the anointing) INCITES wars (demonic frustration, interference and opposition)!!! The OIL coupled with wholehearted consecration and prayer will cause you to make a real IMPACT...not just on the earth but in hell!!!!

962 2018-10-04 21:56:30 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
963 2018-10-04 21:56:26 She was brought up in the Huckabee extreme wrong-wing TV snake oil salesman #evangelical bubble. How could she NOT lie? Her entire life is a lie.
964 2018-10-04 21:56:17 Never tried bison in my kitchen. But treat it like beef and you should be good. I'm a bit of a fan of searing red meat.

 I adore Olive oil, a little butter, garlic, and thyme. Salt and Pepper it an let it rise to near room temp and you should be golden
965 2018-10-04 21:56:15 Mango, Charro, Via Vai, Motor Oil 
966 2018-10-04 21:55:53 They might indeed - and take their oil with them.

969 2018-10-04 21:55:03 Yes. Soak a couple of handfuls of chopped conkers in a litre or so of water for a few days. Strain. Add a few drops of lavender oil. Voilà. Home made laundry detergent.
970 2018-10-04 21:54:42 should jenna get an oil change even though the alert thing on her dashboard hasnt came up???
971 2018-10-04 21:54:40 So you’re saying that every single resident of Alaska is involved in the oil industry??? Or ALL of AK residents are Alaskan Natives who hold rights to the lands being used?? No, I don’t think so. I hold my ground, it’s free money, learn to be grateful.
972 2018-10-04 21:54:36 How about helping all the laid off oil patch families hurt by your disastrous carbon tax ?
973 2018-10-04 21:54:34 Unit shining like I sprayed you with some oil sheen
974 2018-10-04 21:54:26 Doesn't the banana flavouring for milkshakes come from oil too?
975 2018-10-04 21:54:22 Not quite the same way. Make sure they’re fully coated in only a very *thin* amount of oil, that they’re not crowded in the pan, and that you’re calibrating temp/time in the oven
976 2018-10-04 21:54:18 That's weird lol. But evening primrose oil! It's great for acne, not so great for pregnancy unless you know, you don't particularly like having a baby inside you.
977 2018-10-04 21:54:00 Peppermint oil on the temples, a good toke and some sleep?
978 2018-10-04 21:53:57 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.

981 2018-10-04 21:53:31 omg i forgot to put on coconut oil.
982 2018-10-04 21:53:28 See if your humum can get some Exmarid. It’s starflower oil I think and dogs seem to like it a lot. It will help with any dry skin issues.
983 2018-10-04 21:53:26 that's Snake oil, its cheaper..
984 2018-10-04 21:53:14 I asked the Hubs to get my oil changed today since I been at work all week! He got me new tires today too!! That's love
985 2018-10-04 21:53:05 Does an oil diffuser still promote peace and a sense of wellbeing IF IT BREAKS AFTER ONE USE? 

...I feel that this just became rhetorical...carry on  #oildiffuser #struggles #officelife
986 2018-10-04 21:52:58 They carry a horrendous burden for the rest of us that we seldom realise exists

The impact of decades long oil & gas exploration not only scars their environment, but the very fabric of their existence, sustenance, health & livelihood

It's a shame they've to beg 4 anything
987 2018-10-04 21:52:50 Vape Thursday means all vape carts and disposable pens are 20% off! All Blue Rock Acres products are also 20% off: bud, oil and pre-rolls!
988 2018-10-04 21:52:47 I hold long, I think this is funny .. what I don't think is funny is during the 2008 financial crisis SEC fined no one .. and no government is offering incentives for EV or innovative companies tackling climate change.  too many hands in big oil, so many people fighting Tesla
989 2018-10-04 21:52:42 Joe, Sydney needs more residential construction for even more people like a hole in the head, the "transport" system is totally buggered now. When I talk infrastructure I mean transport, oil refineries, dams, irrigation etc. We want to build warships, but what about just cars?
990 2018-10-04 21:52:20 And to stick with Jameson, there's the problem of needing the narrative to grasp the historical, so even wanting to depict post-fordism, say, probably requires narrativizing in terms of events that give a sense of that (e.g., after the oil crisis)
991 2018-10-04 21:52:16 With oil at 70$ a barrel

996 2018-10-04 21:51:23 Any of my lady followers have experience with CBD oil for menstruation cramps? Does it work? Pros/cons? Please retweet
997 2018-10-04 21:51:15 Most furry artists grossly underprice their art anyways. I don't care if your art is crap and you charge $200 for a sketch, that's just as fair a price as a $1 oil painting. Contracts aren't formed until an offer is accepted.
998 2018-10-04 21:51:13 Better get to the SCIF. Might have a little midnight oil burning ahead.
999 2018-10-04 21:51:07 Dude.. except for oil, what have Muslims got.
All inventions are done by Europeans, Americans. India and China now rank 2 and 3 respectively. What is your religion contributing to society exactly?
1000 2018-10-04 21:51:01 Always do! Never been tempted by snake oil salesmen or miracle cures.  Trained as a scientist so I know how to research and analyse data trends. Medical experts knows what they're doing. Never believe Dr. Google,  too many people do 
1001 2018-10-04 21:50:54 Oops sorry...her ass just got stuck while she was trying to go through a normal size door. The fire department is on scene and is using oil from @SenSchumer ‘s hair to lube her ass up to free willy I mean to free @amyschumer
1002 2018-10-04 21:50:52 Indeed , they were given those assurances by those peddling the leave snake oil.
1003 2018-10-04 21:50:46 The whole economy is dairy and oil, and Trudope is blowing it!!! Miss the Harper days so much.  Parliament smells like Jazz cabbage now.
1004 2018-10-04 21:50:30 Chips Away!  What are the four largest manufacturing export products for the US?  #1 is cars; #2 is airplanes; #3 is refined oil; and #4 is now computer chips. $44 billion worth a year! There are 80 wafer fab plants in the US in 19 different states.
1005 2018-10-04 21:50:19 Hell yea! Ain’t nothin slick to a can of oil!

1014 2018-10-04 21:46:40 Legoland Denmark ha(s/d) a display of different offshore grid-supplying technologies as one of its displays! It included an oil rig, wind turbines and (I think) there were little supply lines underwater showing how they connected back to the grid. It was very cool.
1015 2018-10-04 21:46:29 There are “man” things that should be general things that people do. For example, having a “guy” for certain things. I have an oil change dude, tire guy, car wash dudes, tinter for my windows and a mechanic for anything serious.
1016 2018-10-04 21:46:28 @EPAAWheeler from what see your another of trumps puppets out to destroy all the national parks and just make this country one big oil well profit is your god and if you destroy the forests and this countries waters you say so what your in the pocket of big oil and gas your evil

1018 2018-10-04 21:46:22 Isn’t oil natural resource? Asking for a friend thank you in advance for your response 
1019 2018-10-04 21:46:22 It’s been said that we need to have a time of healing. The healing will come when the oil on the butt of humanity is removed from the White House.
1020 2018-10-04 21:46:20 Went off the dome with this one

Butter in pan

Shrimp
Season with salt pep, lime zest, lime juice, minced garlic

Sauté covered 4 minutes then uncovered, stir,

Then honey

1021 2018-10-04 21:46:19 If you take away coal and oil, where does that leave the economy? Mining makes up almost 75% of economy and a 1/3 of Wyomingnites are employed by these companies. Aside from the government and tourism, there are no other major industries here.
1022 2018-10-04 21:45:56 mine too! Argan oil and coconuts!
1023 2018-10-04 21:45:55 A drop of pure and natural extra virgin olive oil is an amazing moisturizer for your skin and won’t clog pores!
1024 2018-10-04 21:45:47 Eh... Reaching for the nether parts has become a #GOP hallmark, in every sense of the phrase. Have they hit rock bottom? They'll keep digging and drilling. Probably hoping to find some more oil dow there. 
1025 2018-10-04 21:45:44 My dog won't take the CBD oil as he struggles to use the vap pen.Also can you get the stuff that gets you stoned ?(asking for a mate)
1026 2018-10-04 21:45:26 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1027 2018-10-04 21:45:25 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1031 2018-10-04 21:45:07 Hi hope you are well. I successfully run a business named Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I would love an opportunity to prove science wrong. When can I provide my service. I would love to do a collaboration with you. Thank you
1032 2018-10-04 21:44:58 Why then are you in bed with #Putin ? Why then are you selling off our public lands to the oil companies #Trump ? Why then are you the re-embodiment of the Robber Barons who thought this nation was their own. #TrumpRussiaConspiracy
1033 2018-10-04 21:44:56 So yesterday this lady went into labor at the shop and ofc I was the only one workin at the time and boy lemme tell you.. I do oil changes tires and breaks. Delivering a baby was not on my job description.
1034 2018-10-04 21:44:43 I think I threw away my Ben Nye Stipple sponge away today when I was leaving class because I can’t find it.  But I just ordered another one from amazon with some Caster sealer oil.
1035 2018-10-04 21:44:34 i miss my beard oil i broke at the airport lmao. and you weirdos don’t @ me bout no oil.
1036 2018-10-04 21:44:31 I was at a meeting today where there was a representative from oil company present. He mentioned something like a .30 cent drop by end of October. Of course this depends on all things staying as is for now.
1037 2018-10-04 21:44:28 16 other ppl are not changing their oil. Any dads looking to adopt new to you sons or daughters?
1038 2018-10-04 21:44:22 a wise man once said that when Mr. Drumpf abolishes a crucial regulation, Jesus dreams about being a #Democrat
1039 2018-10-04 21:44:12 Trump's blowing up of the Iran deal has caused Brent crude oil to rise some 51%. That probably makes him very popular in North Dakota & other oil producing states. 

But in other states, that will hurt him.
1040 2018-10-04 21:44:05 
1041 2018-10-04 21:43:46 I'm sorry Heidi, but the human trafficking that took place in the North Dakota oil fields is completely different from this situation

1045 2018-10-04 21:42:59 The SEC can back down from the deal and then you could lose your CEO job. Then Tesla would become Yet Another Car Company. This is what big oil, the car cartels and the US government want. To eliminate @Tesla. Please refrain from giving shorts more ammunition.

1052 2018-10-04 21:42:23 Watching @ollyofficial and @Mellor76 topless covering themselves in oil and dancing to Ginuwine - Pony 
 

Cheers @lemontwittor 
1053 2018-10-04 21:42:13 Weird to see @JohnCarnegie7 describing the new offshore oil and gas ban as “a surprise”. How can something that was a party in government’s pre-election policy, that was campaigned for by a huge number of Kiwis all over the country for seven years be a surprise?
1054 2018-10-04 21:41:56 Snake oil too. Actually, they could be the side show.
1055 2018-10-04 21:41:49 Ima quit my job and go work in the oil fields lol
1056 2018-10-04 21:41:43 Ugh I just saw the work of someone three years younger than me who oil paints in the style I aspire to in my own work, and who is just /sickeningly/ good, and now I want to burn all my art supplies and work in a fucking bank until I die

1060 2018-10-04 21:41:00 I finally got an oil change

1066 2018-10-04 21:39:58 Tell this idiot that India refines oil for several country and they sell at profit. The price of  petrol & diesel for local consumption is high due to absorption of some subsidies, Excise, local & state tax & distribution costs. So simple you can not sell at the cost you export.
1067 2018-10-04 21:39:56 Shey you know I can type this on word document and print it? 

What you have there, particularly made this your paper statement false. Demand and supply determines the price of commodity e.g Crude oil etc in the market. Go back to your basic secondary Economics textbook.
1068 2018-10-04 21:39:55 That would require someone/anyone to be a card carrying medicinal user.

I'm pretty sure the company's stance is "nothing changes" on October 17th. All of our large oil and gas clients have told us that's going to be their stance as well.
1069 2018-10-04 21:39:50 How much is big oil paying you for these tweets?
1070 2018-10-04 21:39:46 Who pays for these snake oil shows?
1071 2018-10-04 21:39:33 Talks it, standing on a steel ship with 90 tonnes of diesel onboard and 1,800hp Volvo engines is not really walking it if you’re campaigning to make oil history
1072 2018-10-04 21:39:31 I think you might be better off with some cannabis oil mate, better than poison painkillers ( CBD oil ).
1073 2018-10-04 21:39:18 Bitches put coconut oil on their face and call it self care like ok sis clog up your pores

1075 2018-10-04 21:38:38 Do you know if there any benefits to earl grey tea which is infused with bergamot oil?
1076 2018-10-04 21:38:38 Charles what are you wanting it for? In what ways to ease pain? People who are using CBD oil THC Free who were using THC are still feeling the benefits when swapping over! Can you add me to FB messenger and can chat there my friend! Best Wishes Russ
1077 2018-10-04 21:38:37 Its “more than just the salmon” but it’s majority the salmon. The influence of salmon loss on the Southern Residents could be greater than that of pollution,noise,boat disturbance, and even a potential oil spill, according to a 2015 study by the Raincoast Conservation Foundation.

For too long New Delhi has played nice with Washington and got little back
1103 2018-10-04 21:35:15 Venezuela should have reinvested it's money into industrial development, that's what diversification is, it's destroying the oil sector in a day that's a strawman. Do you have any material for why Venezuela doesn't have a sovereign wealth fund or something if that sort?

1115 2018-10-04 21:33:55 @narendramodi @arunjaitley It is hard to understand your cheap policies.U kept on increasing oil prices everyday & when it reached Rs 90 from Rs 70 And brought it down by Rs 2.5. Wow! Even a ParleG biscuit costs Rs 4.Can't we pay Rs 90 if u want us to pay Rs 87.50 ? @TheQuint

1120 2018-10-04 21:33:17 Don’t use coconut or vitamin E oil because those are fatty oils + are likely to clog up your pores. If you really want to use an oil, use tea tree oil. The best thing you could possibly do to reduce it is to get an UNSCENTED salicylic acid face wash. Also, don’t pick at it

1135 2018-10-04 21:31:13 I put too much oil on my hair last night. This shit is limp and greasy.
1136 2018-10-04 21:31:06 Water and oil are both natural resources,but a dam is not a resource it is resovoir,the water here is from all corner and land bought for the harvest due to strategic factors..
1137 2018-10-04 21:31:06 6 under 64 working lively as regards Oil & Energy.
1138 2018-10-04 21:31:05 As far as what specifically would happen if the world stopped using the United States dollar for oil? The answer is, “Very little.” by stating very little is pure conjecture, no argument was put forward to back it up, who controls the production of paper clips?
1139 2018-10-04 21:30:58 Clueless souls abound. Even more plentiful than oil
1140 2018-10-04 21:30:56 A bit like a CNC system.

Empty chips into basket
Lower basket into temperature-controlled oil

Raise basket
Drain
Etc.
1141 2018-10-04 21:30:52 Carbon tax blah blah blah. One would think there was no other issue in this province (save for oil blah blah blah).

1146 2018-10-04 21:30:28 Getting an oil change , I’m really grown out here  my dad didn’t even come with me
1147 2018-10-04 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1148 2018-10-04 21:30:15 @CoryBooker Vote FOR Kavanaugh! Then resign, snake oil salesman!!
1149 2018-10-04 21:29:52 Could not agree more mate! To lose the title because of some oil on the track is so annoying. 

I felt the marshalling as a whole was a little under par that weekend as cars were still at the side of the track even under Safety Car
1150 2018-10-04 21:29:50 He looks like a man from 1915 who’s about to steal my family’s land and drill it for oil.
1151 2018-10-04 21:29:48 @HCofficials Ay yi yi.  Why do I have to be broke right now?  Why do I have to be an adult and change the oil in my car? *sob*
1152 2018-10-04 21:29:39 Meanwhile, oil extracted from marijuana has a high THC count and a low CBD count. Both hemp and marijuana are in the cannabis family. For cancer treatment, both may be beneficial, but please talk about it with your doctor. I hope CBD will help you! [2/2]
1153 2018-10-04 21:29:31 I don't mean to lessen your excitement but I'm pretty sure the oil barrels are resin! Still one of the loveliest games in terms of production and gameplay!
1154 2018-10-04 21:29:24 Charles, please be weary of purchasing products through MLMs. CBD oil is commonly extracted from hemp because hemp plants have a high CBD content and a low THC content. [1/2]
1155 2018-10-04 21:29:20 What was the name of the song by Midnight Oil on the Heavy Metal soundtrack? I looked it up and for some reason it's not listed? Weird.
1156 2018-10-04 21:29:17 Phir humare paas oil kyon nahi hai. 
1157 2018-10-04 21:29:12 Whatchu oil’ing your scalp with G ?
1158 2018-10-04 21:29:10 If Kavanaugh had acted like that at a job interview at the multifaceted, multinational oil company I once worked for, the suits would have been like , "Whoa - that guy's too damn ruthless for us!"
1159 2018-10-04 21:29:02 I am that daughter from all the memes about needing a reminder to get an oil change. It’s me guys.
1160 2018-10-04 21:28:57 So I went to a different location for my oil change today and while I’m waiting for them to finish I’m hanging at probably the sketchiest little pool hall ever but they sell Gatorade so it’s all good?
1161 2018-10-04 21:28:49 Need to make oil from India coal , invest invest in alternate fuel , pay millions to companies that can do this , ask Toyota , long term will save billions
1162 2018-10-04 21:28:18   Oil all over your carpet
1163 2018-10-04 21:28:17 Well that didn’t happen now did it? I bet if I had 5 million dollars, I’d be off Twitter and enjoying getting suntan oil applied to me by a large muscular gentleman in Fiji-but I deal in reality.
1164 2018-10-04 21:28:12 That oil dropped me.

1167 2018-10-04 21:27:53 Can you tell me if Mr Organic Sunflower Oil 1L is plastic or glass?
1168 2018-10-04 21:27:51 Actually the price of oil for common man is reduced to only 1.5rs and companies reduced 1rs which they give to the state. This makes 2.50rs.
1169 2018-10-04 21:27:31 Oil and gold can't do anything, its the men-power which they dont have it now. They are under the control of Netanyahu and Trump, and killing innocent muslims in the name of Jihad.
It was never Saudia Arabia, it was Hejaz and Najd and I respect our holy land.
1170 2018-10-04 21:27:12 Aunty I sell anointing oil in case you need something to step it down. Bon apetit .

1173 2018-10-04 21:26:27 What really counts is bankrupting the regime, it may be sufficiently damaging to the regime already facing #IraniansWantRegimeChange and #IranianTruckersOnStrike if they end up losing half of their oil revenue and get their payments frozen
1174 2018-10-04 21:26:22 Big Oil and Big Auto - worldwide. They are pushed into a corner and will stop at nothing to save their reign of yesteryear. The future belongs to electric cars, solar, batteries, AI, alternative clean transport #everythingelon #hatersgonnahate
1175 2018-10-04 21:26:10 The oil industry would beg to differ.
1176 2018-10-04 21:26:05 Let’s talk about Pathetic. 67 last cup. Oil 90. Last Cup Final 67. Oil 06. Since then we all make fun of the oil and their decade of darkness. But since 06 we have made it to the 2nd Round. Toronto has not. RJ you were 12 the last time Toronto won a playoff series. So....
1177 2018-10-04 21:26:04 Nice to meet you and your family too. I also came out of the meeting feeling very positive especially with "2" SUPER MAJORS in competition looking at a deal with #FFR 
1178 2018-10-04 21:26:00 She has no plans & has said repeatedly that no gov agency could be anymore efficient.  Think of how this past session ended.  Laura Kelly & the Senate = oil & water.  NOTHING will get accomplished.  & Greg has an AWESOME, focused education plan that doesn’t involve tax increases!
1179 2018-10-04 21:25:55 Is that the oil blotting papers? Lol

Oil was $47 on deal date to buy assets at $10 via SPAC.

Oil +60%
Stock -65%

Was told worst IPO in last 7yrs 

Considering it is a deal done with oil ripping since, might be one of worst energy PE deals ever?

1185 2018-10-04 21:24:58 @McLarenF1 have you got your oil yet?

1187 2018-10-04 21:24:46 Trump, private energy companies, big oil, other major investors (say, BlackRock).  Trump is the idiot in the court.

1199 2018-10-04 21:22:56 That's cool. It must be Midnight Oil that I am thinking of. Unfortunately, all of my vinyl was ruined in a flood.
1200 2018-10-04 21:22:53 Let me remind you that #Trump doesn't want #Iran to sell its oil in exchange for goods. He wants to reduce #Iran's oils sales to zero. That means #Iran has no foreign exchange to import anything. You are a good little traitor and useful idiot for #Iran's enemies.
1201 2018-10-04 21:22:38 @ultabeauty’s samples are trash. Why would I want beard oil? How many blurring primers are you going to send me...
1202 2018-10-04 21:22:36 fact remains that @elrufai even though he's unstable knows that if he conducts primaries for zone two tomorrow INEC won't collect the name of his house boy from him.

He has lost the battle and war before it began!!!
1203 2018-10-04 21:22:14 I remember Mrs P’s Dad being offered a trial on coin operated chip vending machines years ago.... dropping portions of frozen fries into hot oil must be v easy to automate. I think I’d be very careful about wilfully withdrawing my labour if I was in the biz 
1204 2018-10-04 21:22:10 What kind of oil?? I have oily hair so i have to be careful what i use, it’ll make my ends feel heavy and gross. I can’t wear my hair down without heat because it’s super frizzy
1205 2018-10-04 21:21:52 @truselforganics I love your face cleanser, but I just saw your Uplifting Citrus Body Bar has palm oil in it. Why are you using an ingredient that's notorious for being harmful to our planet?

1211 2018-10-04 21:20:31 core that sounds good.
1212 2018-10-04 21:20:29 Thx. Handful of guys like you and @PeterSong909 big help as I improve. @asymmetricalpha keeps bullish bias in check and really helped call a lot of this week's down turn.

Still really liking banks and oil/energy into tomorrow.

1213 2018-10-04 21:20:29 Forget about could, the Chinese would pay fire sale price and take advantage of corrupt retarded dictators like Venezuela and Iran regimes. We saw how the blood sucking Chinese saved Venezuelan regime by bankrupting their oil industry worse than any sanctions could've done

will take the 200% profit, sadly some will just retrieve their outlay BUT the real money will be made when Corporate Big Oil gets involved. I can easily see a bidding war rapidly developing with a T/O price of 75p to 100p.

1224 2018-10-04 21:19:05 Also China? is not enough with Russia? All are a bunch of lies. Accusing everybody of anithing. Trump went mad due to China's decision not the buy more US oil. That's the truth!

1232 2018-10-04 21:17:40 Do you mean...
... "recognize British rule as illegitimate...?
Britain thinks it has a right to decide where it should belong to, through referendum. But d oppressed people, like Biafrans, whose OIL & GAS Britain confiscated in 1970 after killing over 6 million Biafrans, can't.

1236 2018-10-04 21:17:15 basically if u turn around the green thing there’s a hole and u put the yellow candle in it and the oil and flowers up the top and it burns and smells nice
1237 2018-10-04 21:16:46 Yes, but most oil focussed co's trade in USD anyway, as do most long distance shipping lines.
1238 2018-10-04 21:16:44 Please avail yourself of the definition of "vulgar".
1239 2018-10-04 21:16:42 Renewables & Energy is a €25bn pipeline to get to 30%. Double again for 60%. That's solid 5bn a year investment pipeline or 2-3% onto GDP. Plus import reversal of 15bn a year (rising rapidly as oil hurtles to $100.) plus avoiding EU fines. Plus export potential.
1240 2018-10-04 21:16:39 But anyways. Yes the tuna in oil is gross 
1241 2018-10-04 21:16:38 Heidi Heitkamp is a repubcrat. She always votes with big oil republicans. She is just trying to save her seat by voting no on Kavanaugh
1242 2018-10-04 21:16:35 US alone has added more than 5 million barrels of oil per day doubling its output since 2010, added more than a million or 1/4 of Iran total output since 2007, meanwhile US consumption has declined. Canada and Mexico also increased their outputs

1251 2018-10-04 21:15:22 Are we supposed to be surprised? According to Trudeau and Notley we conservatives who believe that women make choices to go into certain careers (like nursing) instead of others (oil filed, welders) are misogynist pigs.

1272 2018-10-04 21:11:47 So this is supposed to be a fan acc but i asked for fashion advice and now im asking for beauty advice... Does coconut oil clog your pores?
1273 2018-10-04 21:11:43 aw, that's so cute. #StonerDog 
You're lucky. Our Govt here in New Zealand would prefer our dogs/pet suffer than allow us to access CBD oil to treat them - they like to keep the pharmaceutical industry wealthy instead.
1274 2018-10-04 21:11:37 Yeah, but if you consider fact that Russia is about 50% smaller in size than USSR/Tsarist Russia, has about half the population, and lost key industrial areas of Donbass and oil from Baku, that explains a fair part of it
1275 2018-10-04 21:11:27 I still don't get it, how a single tweet here and there from someone so transparent can get so many upset... In fact, I don't believe it. Oil money is the root of this. So glad Elon has the balls to stand up to these bastards.

1280 2018-10-04 21:11:04 You do realise that with the oil price as it is and with the new finds off Shetland we have no chance of indyref2. WM needs the oil revenue to fund UK when the ecomony tanks after brexit
1281 2018-10-04 21:11:03 Water & Oil among others are natural resources, & then why is Turkana county residents are getting a share of revenue earned from crude oil & when it comes to Murang'a no compensation?Sonko en at al r lying to Kenyans on rivers feeding Ndakaini with water, let b honest.
1282 2018-10-04 21:11:02 Joemat petterson sold the oil reserves under the very same president who wanted "us" to own our oil.

1290 2018-10-04 21:10:23 I've been using CBD Oil for 4 yrs and I give it to my 2 dogs.  It's given me my life back and saved my dog when he had a stroke in Jan 2018.

1293 2018-10-04 21:10:16 They gave me a shot of morphine,that sh**t made me feel good,lol. It took the pain away in 5 minutes! Yes that's why I said medical but I dont know if you want to take that route. Have you ever heard of Blackseed oil? It is very strong and bitter I take 2 tsp. a day.
1294 2018-10-04 21:10:09 Great questions to which we need answers. No need for an oil producing country like Nigeria not having its business on point. It's a mentality problem. We need to reconnect with nature and science, the way it was before the colonizers came and de-Africanize our way of thinking!

Tories love nothing more than gore.
Every pompous suited bore
Dreams of starting another war.
Pompous deceivers to their core
Stealing land, gas, oil and more
Pretending leaders to deplore
To grab the wealth they so adore

1299 2018-10-04 21:09:16  Oil prices fell as prospect of increased crude production from Saudi Arabia & Russia prompted profit-taking.

Yesterday futures hit 4 year highs on a boost from imminent U.S. sanctions on OPEC's No. 3 producer Iran.

Brent crude fell $1.71, or 1.98% to settle $84.58 a barrel.

Fool. #QAnon = #QuackAnon
1301 2018-10-04 21:08:30 My poor friend. Carry some lavender oil with you and  rub on your temples and wrist when it starts. It really will help!
1302 2018-10-04 21:08:29 You have to quit listening to these Snake Oil salesman.
Please understand if America didn’t like Muslims do you think you would be famous?
Follow how many white youth of America love ALL colored athletes. It is sad you make such a declaration since Americans made you relevant.

1311 2018-10-04 21:07:15 I have jumped off the roof of a building with an umbrella cos i thought it would make me fly.
I chose to not study shit for some tests. I put the harshest menthol oil in my nose which caused me to bleed. But continuing to use @VodafoneGhana remains my stupidest decision.
1312 2018-10-04 21:07:12 Lol. I’ve always thought that. Players looked old as hell back in the day. My pops worked in the oil field too.

1314 2018-10-04 21:06:48 2-3) The current slowing down in housing & cars market. Add to all of these issues the current volatile & explosive condition in the Middle East, Venezuela, Libya for example, which would cause an increase in the price of oil & gas. Our global debt is more than our global GDP.
1315 2018-10-04 21:06:39 you better bring that extensive oil and gas knowledge and experience to help our customers meet the toughest oilfield challenge xx
1316 2018-10-04 21:06:34 According to the experts, it remains all or more 20 years to the oil of the mother of the north - the small england will have more means than an indebted Scotland and soon without oil - stop dreaming
1317 2018-10-04 21:06:34 How come nobody told me about using baby oil after showering?!?!
1318 2018-10-04 21:06:28 About to try CBD oil for the first time bc crippling anxiety let’s see how this goes
1319 2018-10-04 21:06:21 You can advocate something & do your best to fight it without turning a blind eye to it, regardless of your personal situation. We hate the oil industry but drive cars, ppl refuse to own up that big aggra is an unstoppable cesspool because it’s a more depressing/emotional topic
1320 2018-10-04 21:06:15 I really like them. They’re really well made formulations at super affordable prices. Some favs are the 23% vitamin c suspension, the AHA/BHA Peel, and the evening primrose oil.
1321 2018-10-04 21:05:59 Baby oil >> lotion
1322 2018-10-04 21:05:48 Oil girls oil is the answer

1326 2018-10-04 21:05:32 It was the UN Security Council. Also, it was Harold Wilson who terminated the UDI and imposed economic sanctions to Rhodesia restricting the imports of Rhodesian products to UK, cutting foreign aid and the supply of oil et al. However, Rhodesia got support from SA and Portugal.
1327 2018-10-04 21:05:13 Only time y’all niggas smoking flavors is when you got an oil pen
1328 2018-10-04 21:05:11 In 7 months the NZ$ has fallen by 12.5% from 74cents US to 64.75cents US. It is now worth 12.5%. less. It means the price of all our imports has gone up, especially oil. Exporters however get higher incomes as the US$ they earn exchange for more NZ$, but they face higher costs.
1329 2018-10-04 21:04:46 try using grapeseed oil after your moisturizer  itll keep the oild lovked into ur skin
1330 2018-10-04 21:04:26 Patronising me is not an argument, prove to me that whoever controls the oil does not control the world, by doing so you will prove that the petrodollar is a myth
1331 2018-10-04 21:04:20 sorry the reception on the oil rig with lucille is bad what did you say
1332 2018-10-04 21:04:14 I feel ya. My meal today is. 15 pieces of pepperoni, 4 cheese cubes, 4 oz of fajita chicken, 1/2 cup of cottage cheese with flax oil, 1/4 cup of organic black beans. And of course my 1 monster lol
1333 2018-10-04 21:04:13 It could be the ‘before’ picture in an Oil of Ulay advert.
1334 2018-10-04 21:04:07 Some people are gonna regret how they handled you. 
All because they took the oil on your life lightly.

1335 2018-10-04 21:04:07 Based on yesterday's inputs, it seems the govt is all in with the tax reform. And with confluence of rising rates, weaker peso, and higher oil prices, what's at stake is a scenario of a slowdown in  fiscal spending. Infra will go on but govt must save up on others. #whatsplanB
1336 2018-10-04 21:04:02 I just got a free oil change.. are we really sure we wanna end the patriarchy
1337 2018-10-04 21:03:28 Too late I chickened out and didn’t take it. It was thc oil with a big marijuana plant on it so I figured I’d better not lol
1338 2018-10-04 21:03:24 Friends who are participating in #SoberOctober - is CBD oil (with 0% THC) considered a drug or substance that would be considered a sober October cheat?
1339 2018-10-04 21:03:23 Well, how does this stolen oil get out of Syria? And why aren't its export routes, through Syria, legitimate military focus of the Syrian Arab Army and Air force?
1340 2018-10-04 21:03:02 Anyone who struggles to get patchy tan off, use coconut oil and a exfoliating mitt and it comes straight off!

1358 2018-10-04 21:00:48 Gas prices are not, can't be, controlled by governments. OPEC decides how much a barrel of crude oil will be each day. Who are you (the govt) then to foolishly do price fixing? That's bad econ. #Pakistan #OPEC 
Fact is prices should never be fixed. Let markets decide

1365 2018-10-04 21:00:22 Seems that the local fire department wasn't informed of what was in that tank.  "Fulkerson says the tank contains a mixture of glycol, heating oil and possibly natural gas. He says spraying water on the tank made the fire worse."
1366 2018-10-04 21:00:08 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1367 2018-10-04 21:00:02 AraBIT of the Day:

1368 2018-10-04 20:59:57 @DrOz Don’t give this snake oil peddler any credibility. You lose it by going on his show. Even people in his own field denounced him.

1382 2018-10-04 20:57:08 Well if you think about it, coal, oil, and other national gases all hold energy and so do rocks. People believe crystals can bring energy to you or remove energy from you and that it has a healing factor to that. If you look into the metaphysical world there is so much to learn!
1383 2018-10-04 20:57:06 I don't see why you can't just change the oil again? Even if there is a little bit of the wrong oil left, it shouldnt be harmful
1384 2018-10-04 20:56:57 So where are we on the authoritative proof of oil/gas in the Clyde?
1385 2018-10-04 20:56:57 btw, Ataraxia has reverted back to their original formula for their vape carts. no more "holy water", now back to alcohol-derived vape oil. if it's like their original, that's also a very clean & tasty vape.

1391 2018-10-04 20:56:17 Smh let me use your discount to get an oil change
1392 2018-10-04 20:56:16 Can't read it. But leave it be. Just a little oil, not wax or varnish. Makes all the difference; never hide what is there. And conversely never fake what isn't.
1393 2018-10-04 20:56:10 I feel like such a fucking woman  Got on a oil change, a new(used) tire, an eye exam/contacts, and did some grocery shopping. I may be a broke woman, but at least I feel like dope ass broke woman 
1394 2018-10-04 20:56:04 We are sick n tired of this despots... They have looted everything .. sio pyrethrum, sio oil... #Failedstate
1395 2018-10-04 20:55:58 Also, remember, when using synthetic oil you typically change it every 6000 miles and on non synthetic you need to change it at 3000
1396 2018-10-04 20:55:56 I can #BelieveWomen, #BelieveSurvivors and also #BelieveEvidenceNotGender without being evil.

1397 2018-10-04 20:55:51 as long as the oil companies remain in business nothing we do will prevent the extinction of humanity caused by global warming
1398 2018-10-04 20:55:40 why does arnica oil make your back feel like it’s been set on fire????
1399 2018-10-04 20:55:14 Not needed. She gets enough from all the oil companies. Save that money for a true progressive
1400 2018-10-04 20:55:14 And this why I have been buying us oil and gas stocks
1401 2018-10-04 20:55:09 I guess bikini patrol oil doesn't have as much of a ring to it
1402 2018-10-04 20:55:04 Noticed today that places were putting up the price of petrol and diesel ahead of #Budget19 Oil price hasn't gone up much so why the increase in fuel prices. Are they goin to punish us with increase in excise duty in the budget
1403 2018-10-04 20:54:53 What if we gift it to them and they decide to shut it down or hold the oil producers hostage?, how does that help us get our oil to market
1404 2018-10-04 20:54:50 I would rub you down with oil so no sunburn then massage your feet then back massage then say baby you need anything else
1405 2018-10-04 20:54:37 Oil is not a massive part of Scotland's recent economic success. I have looked at it quite a lot. Glasgow has really outperformed. Edinburgh doing well as always.
1406 2018-10-04 20:54:30 Anybody on camp know how to change oil in a Ford Focus ? #FVSU

1439 2018-10-04 20:50:19 Before you compare how much OBJ sold oil, you have to discuss market access during his era i.e. demand & supply of crude oil in the international market. What has changed now is that there's less demand because more countries are using alternative energy to prevent climate change
1440 2018-10-04 20:50:02  Imma do a hot oil treatment tomorrow 
1441 2018-10-04 20:49:48 My favorite primer that ACTUALLY controls my oil all day has been out of stock for like?? months and I’m so sad cause I’m out and my makeup looks so bad

1443 2018-10-04 20:49:29 I bought some rose mary olive oil wraps and they’ve seriously been REVOLUTIONARY
1444 2018-10-04 20:49:22 Fair enough ,but I can copy & paste as well , but it doesn't change the fact we R  a resource rich nation that only contributes 1.6% of the globes emmisions, that doesn't tax incoming oil on our east coast that has 0 regulation on the extraction process, which should B a concern.
1445 2018-10-04 20:49:20 You buying his snake oil too?

1453 2018-10-04 20:48:23 Just had an EXCELLENT experience at customs. Very different from the last time. Brought in oil samples again but this time paid $0 in duties and fees. How - applied for and got a manufacturers PIR....and walked with the letter as proof! #BetterBizJa
1454 2018-10-04 20:48:22 Just wondering how much that oil (Aberdeen) and financial services (Edinburgh), arguably two long-term endowments, drive the Scottish outperformance? Would Glasgow (heavy industry) look more like Northern England?
1455 2018-10-04 20:48:22 Apparently my bf used the same jar of coconut oil that I use for removing make up for cooking and dropped some tiny pieces of garlic into it.

Damn! I smell like a garlic baguette!... 
Ok, I won’t be attacked by  but how can I sleep without getting hungry?!? #fml 
1456 2018-10-04 20:48:21 Easily sorted. Cook them in olive oil, butter, garlic, sweet smoked paprika and Fino.... lardons too if that’s your thing
1457 2018-10-04 20:48:19 Trump wants lower oil prices before the 6 November US midterm elections. The Saudis (and Russians) have the capacity to deliver that by ramping up production. The Saudi ruling class is highly dependent on the US to provide the regional stability that helps keep them in power.

1460 2018-10-04 20:47:59 200’ hasn’t been found scientifically safe. It has been repeatedly found to be insufficient. If it were safe, oil & gas companies wouldn’t require anyone, ANYWHERE on drilling sites to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). Sites often larger than 500’ beyond wells & equip.
1461 2018-10-04 20:47:45 It lost more than 75% of its oil revenue for a few years now, nothing happened. Make sure you don’t bribe a police officer on your way home.
1462 2018-10-04 20:47:34 Understand that the USA has considerable oil interests in many Landlocked Nations, they pushed international law (enforced it) to make landlocked nations only pay "expense and security" of pipelines and port access.  Canada is a tidewater nation - discount oil will continue.Part1
1463 2018-10-04 20:47:11 I literally avoid I25 at all costs from 3PM to 7PM, and thanks to this long ass oil change process I’ll be right in the peak hour of traffic  can’t wait 
1464 2018-10-04 20:46:39 Don’t use oil based cleaners or makeup wipes! Brush them out daily, no mascara, lightly blow dry them after getting out of shower or pat them dry after swimming
1465 2018-10-04 20:46:26 ?oil change? Is that why?

1470 2018-10-04 20:45:56 I was so horrified seeing them throw it in and just.. lots of oil.. no nothing. WHAT ARE THEY DOING
1471 2018-10-04 20:45:47 I'll throw in a 4th or 5th vote for stirring almost constantly and not overcooking them. I use almost no oil, but a decent amount of cheddar cheese. A little salt, pepper, and milk too. I've had dozens of couchsurfers from around the world tell me they are great.
1472 2018-10-04 20:45:41 Kheyre oil, I have got no insight about it. I need help.
1473 2018-10-04 20:45:24 In my experience, no virus expression has always been from a clogged injector  do you guys fill injectors with silicon oil before the virus? Helps avoid air bubbles. We haven’t had any issues since we started doing that!

1527 2018-10-04 20:37:27 Powders (not even mineral ones) don’t have moisturizing properties, they have absorbent ones. They can absorb excess oil and prevent shine so that’s why they are recommended for those with oily skin types. In addition, some powders can also mattify skin.-google!

And oil price jumped to $86/Barrel. You are still paying 145/Liter. U need to learn ARITHMETICS if u dont belive in subsidy

1542 2018-10-04 20:35:09 Government trying to creat impression that petrol prize is high due to international factors,Truth is oil is expansive simply due to high tax of government, tax is more than double the original oil prize. So government playing game to look good but continue to loot people .
1543 2018-10-04 20:35:02 @CatherineBizTV Please Please Please get @PeterSchiff on. He will tell you the truth on why oil is going up, bonds yields are going up, and why markets look toppy.

1545 2018-10-04 20:34:54 My face will be shining when it is sunny as if the oil in the entire planet is on my face. Ironically I have a dry skin.
1546 2018-10-04 20:34:48 The fremen were the Middle Eastern people and the spice represented oil, amirite?
1547 2018-10-04 20:34:45 This guy is misinformed, fuel prices are rising globally due to sanctions USA imposed on Iran. A barrow of crued oil has since risen from 38 $ to USD 78.

1549 2018-10-04 20:34:34 There will be no improvement if they keep Chaves's boy Madura in charge.
I worked there end 80's when Chaves started to Nationalize.
Was clear then it would end up in tears. The high oil price saved him for a while, but after that it went downhill.
My ex colleagues are suffering.
1550 2018-10-04 20:34:34 Thank you. My DD1 just suggested coconut oil &followed with this message:
'I think I just suggest coconut oil for everything:
Makeup remover? Coconut oil. Need to cook? Coconut oil.
Dry skin? Coconut oil.
Dry hair? Coconut oil. 
No oil in your car? You know it - coconut oil.'

1556 2018-10-04 20:34:13 You are such a snake oil merchant.

Go on.  Tell everyone that it only touches the sides of our need to support Services exports.

Compare with the SM this is the reverse of “free” & we cannot make up the loss in our EU trade through other means..

And NI border.  No solution.

1559 2018-10-04 20:33:49 LOL, I got hammered shorting oil, covering for losses, rinsing and repeating. But they gave it back to me today and then some. I haven't spoke about the gains. For some perverse reason, I like talking about my losses.
1560 2018-10-04 20:33:47 or Motor Oil.
1561 2018-10-04 20:33:31 @nitin_gadkari it's not efected in election's 2.5 cut off in oil price shouldn't be a major cut off  you may introduce oil in to gst major price down help bjp to win elections
1562 2018-10-04 20:33:28 Falling rating + increasing oil prices + securing friends in EU = annexation Sea of Azov, maybe even Mariupol or some regime changes
1563 2018-10-04 20:33:26 You're right, but it wasn't bad even.
Dow down 3/4%, but well off the lows.
And oil down 2.4% makes it a good day!
1564 2018-10-04 20:33:25 Coconut oil is betr option n works wonder for hair fall,
1565 2018-10-04 20:33:13 Hearing the crowd cheer as hand drawn superheroes raced across the screen of a modern, theatrical release... it felt like a drum of oil poured over the heart-flames I've been stoking!

PLUUUSSSSS UUULLTRAAAAAAAAA!!!

1569 2018-10-04 20:32:53 There is no petrodollar. That is not a real thing. It's like 'big deal' they price oil in dollars. That is Alex Jones talking. Leave it be.

1571 2018-10-04 20:32:11 Yes! Had to switch from the olive oil one, It wasn’t doing me no justice.
1572 2018-10-04 20:31:46 Magnificent.  The only missing element I can think of is Snake Oil Jake, who is adamant that brexit will yield dividends for the UK.  He promises riches for all, but never offers any evidence.  Meanwhile he's busy investing abroad.

1580 2018-10-04 20:30:47 No one on the left is good enough for the left. Pardon the metaphor, but it’s “fiddling while Rome burns.”
1581 2018-10-04 20:30:39 So i’m catching up on #thecircle did i really see Dan rub oil all over his chicken & not season it
1582 2018-10-04 20:30:31 I swear it’s so helpful. I use mostly lavender oil & then add either eucalyptus or peppermint. Always make sure it’s 100% pure oil though otherwise you’ll be inhaling strange chemicals. They have them on amazon really cheap.I’m so glad you’re staying vocal w all you’re going thru
1583 2018-10-04 20:30:29 Hot oil massage tomorrow after work and I can’t wait!

1603 2018-10-04 20:27:49 It has nothing to do with location.
1604 2018-10-04 20:27:34 Nice piece from @JustinWorland discussing the efforts of @OXY_Petroleum and the oil/gas industry as a whole to find solutions for #climate - often in collaboration with major environmental groups #oilandgas #energy #climatechange

1608 2018-10-04 20:27:13 You meant to say, it's called oil because it's a slick deck.  
1609 2018-10-04 20:27:04 Taxes on royalties on foreign companies in bolivia's oil and gas is much much higher than 13%
1610 2018-10-04 20:26:58 Medics are so obsessed with talking about medicine. My oil trader housemate has started to pick up the lingo - says he got so drunk at Oktoberfest he “probably needed intubating”  #medicchat #boringmedics
1611 2018-10-04 20:26:55 But puttie just blamed Trump for high oil prices... hmmm maybe puttie tell him I need oil prices to go up and dis his way of telling him
1612 2018-10-04 20:26:43 Is Elon Musk a false flag operative sent by the oil industry to destroy electric cars?

It's either that or he's a dumb motherfucker. Or both.
1613 2018-10-04 20:26:38 Well, I don't know about predictable. Oil and gold discoveries that produced local boom towns were not predictable. But I agree with sound money there would be a market maximum, though the range would be quite high. It wouldn't be as predictable as you think.
1614 2018-10-04 20:25:59 สวย
1615 2018-10-04 20:25:57 You used a oil money cheat mode

1617 2018-10-04 20:25:34 no- that is an oil painting- but funny you should ask-I decided after posting that to do some of my whale paintings on fabric for quilts. I will probably use either beeswax crayon or oil paint on fabric.
1618 2018-10-04 20:25:33 Do we now fart while walking on the road in Lagos? Like have we now reached that stage?
1619 2018-10-04 20:25:12 Well I was creative with the term oil . Auto-barber, toxicologist and Corsair tend to fulfil that role.
1620 2018-10-04 20:25:08 Trump please also take time for negotiating oil prices with OPEC ...apart from spending time with @StormyDaniels
1621 2018-10-04 20:25:06 BS - not buying any bottles of your snake oil.
1622 2018-10-04 20:24:51 What! why are we going to use coal when we are a oil producing country? In addition coal has been abandon even in the countries where it is mined. This doesn’t sound right.

1625 2018-10-04 20:23:47 I read your article and you make some good points, but there is no mention of oil, the petrodollar is why the US empire exists, without it the US is bust, all the lovely progressive MMT ideas can only exist in conjunction with the petrodollar, our lives literally depend on oil.
1626 2018-10-04 20:23:47 I love my essential oil diffuser so much and can hardly remember life without it. Little things! I just wish I knew more about which oils work for what. If you know good guides for that sorta thing pls help out your pal anna scott-piano thnx
1627 2018-10-04 20:23:34 @HondaCanada  any update on when the oil dilution and heat issue fixes coming out for the 2018 CRV? Tired of the nauseating fuel smell and lack of heat.
1628 2018-10-04 20:23:32 sorry you don't feel well, lovely...maybe sip some tea? clove oil works wonders for a toothache (or cut off the pokey and put the clove near the toothache)

Gotta Love it!

I'm going with Vanilla Candles burning, Rose pedal oil warmed up between my palms... Lindt chocolate on a dish and Louis Roederer 1984 sparkling in the coupe

inhale through the nostrils...nice!
1635 2018-10-04 20:22:35 And then fry with butter instead of oil 
1636 2018-10-04 20:22:28 Well it's either a) physical, b) Chemical, or c) biological. If it's A it probably got too hot. If it's B maybe the avocado oil spoiled? If it's C run!
1637 2018-10-04 20:22:11 As a Wyomingite I understand oil drilling, refining and transporting and the ensuing effects on gas prices. But gas in Mackay is 22 cents a gallon cheaper than in Challis and the 2 towns are 52 miles apart. That's not a transportation issue, it's greed.
1638 2018-10-04 20:22:03 I look at it as boiled in oil. Can't boil without oil.
1639 2018-10-04 20:21:55 Would not be surprised at all to find out the chemicals they used to sink the oil spill are coming back to haunt them.
1640 2018-10-04 20:21:44 Like when right after the Exxon Valdez oil spill and Exxon tried to change their name back to Esso...
1641 2018-10-04 20:21:40 Let's see...

1649 2018-10-04 20:20:21 Literally everyone can see the connections, but you're likely to embarrassed to admit that you were conned. Congrats, you bought Snake Oil, you played yourself. Literally read anything other than Extreme Right Wing media or global news.
1650 2018-10-04 20:20:09 Oven roasted broccoli, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic and Parmesan cheese. S&P to taste
1651 2018-10-04 20:20:06 Inflation exists even if new dollars aren't created. Take two cities, NY and LA. If oil is discovered in LA, people move invested dollars out of NY and into LA. As a result, you'll have deflation in NY and inflation in LA. Yes, the Fed makes it worse, but inflation is natural.
1652 2018-10-04 20:19:46 I think just salt and oil (probably just oil) would preserve.

You can also make a pepper marinara or pomodoro sauce for pasta. That's what my mom does and it's chronic.
1653 2018-10-04 20:19:36 There are the human predetors out there all the time fishing for these beautiful creatures for oil foods etc... You would have to be God to stop them

1661 2018-10-04 20:18:23 Whoa! Is it true? That @Lindsey Graham received $k’s  from a Russian oil billionaire? Is that why Graham’s attitude has changed? Why all of a sudden Graham is so tolerant  of Trump? Did Trump turn Graham on to his “money source”? Is Democracy being knifed in the back? ASK! 
1662 2018-10-04 20:18:08 Ty . I have suffered but not more than mothers,in nations most people could never find on the map. My loss is no greater than theirs. For they were having breakfast, supper or just about their regular day when my sons destroyed homes & families for our Empires greed for oil.
1663 2018-10-04 20:18:05 CPR? When several bottles of olive oil a.k.a "anointing oil" would have been emptied on the person while "binding and losing" in submachine gun sounding tongues?... there is 99.9% chance it would be viewed as a spiritual attack rather than medical.
1664 2018-10-04 20:18:01 They are not done with the blame game. What did PDP do with oil price when it was high. Now there is oil boom but they are still blaming PDP. We are watching and God is more interested in the drama going on.
1665 2018-10-04 20:17:58 Love humous, really love humous made with extra virgin olive oil! Yum!

1679 2018-10-04 20:16:30 Yes Ambassador Iran can file with the International Court.  We can not just do whatever we want.  Iran asked for two things.  Medicine for cancer victims and airplane parts. Iran is not backing down. Syria is coming after us too.Fighting Iran for decades. Who gets oil, gas rights

1681 2018-10-04 20:16:25 They tried #regimeChange in #Iran 9 years ago. It didn't work.They want oil and gas and the strategic geo-bridges. People's lives don't matter to them. We have to support each other in the region. All of ME has wonderful historical and moral heritage before invaders #trade

1686 2018-10-04 20:15:56 I don't think it's going to be a problem to recover. We'll recovery quickly. Look how we're doing with 60% of our revenue. With another 40%? Then ALL the oil money which we currently only get 8% of?? PLUS money not squandered on Trident, HS2, London sewers etc? We'll be fine.
1687 2018-10-04 20:15:47 USA can sell their oil. EU is not the only oil consumer on this planet.

Russia is good supplier. There were few problems in the past, and each one of them was caused by Ukraine. Hence we build direct pipes in North Sea.

1707 2018-10-04 20:13:09  what Alex said. Presenting their conclusions as a damning indictment of all constructivist research seems an overreach. Lab-based/quants research can also be fudged, just in different ways, no? Food for thought nonetheless. Nobody likes snake oil.

1710 2018-10-04 20:12:56 I mean I gotta be honest I work in a restaurant that cooks with oil a lot, and I clean often. Even our hard surfaces get a layer of oil on them if they’re not cleaned regularly; our vent hood functions well. Not sure how’d we have clean soft surfaces :/

1743 2018-10-04 20:09:30 “Oil”
1744 2018-10-04 20:09:19 Aye, but there's barely a bucketful left so it'll be nearly worthless. Not like that Norwegian oil or Kuwaiti oil, eh?
1745 2018-10-04 20:08:59 The good thing.   The supply of our raw goods are ever increasing (trend line yield growth) versus oil supplies that are ever decreasing.  (At cheap values)

1749 2018-10-04 20:08:23 For the FG, the debt service as % of revenue figure is higher than for the Federation.

IMF estimated 2017 figure at c. 70%

S&P’s recent estimate of the 2018 figure:  a lot lower

...and as oil prices keep rising, this concern might take a back seat (for a while)
1750 2018-10-04 20:08:19 I sincerely doubt that unless you live in a shack with a dirt floor with little more than a bed, an oil lamp, and a little hole to store food. All luxuries are a "waste of money".

1806 2018-10-04 20:02:27 Especially when there is high chance of more as suspected by the experts in the field - also once trident is returned to England oil is also suspected in the west coast too
1807 2018-10-04 20:02:16 $cei  EVEN if the oil prices would fall back some expenses would be so low we`d still make a profit

1810 2018-10-04 20:01:57 I brought chance's truck for an oil change and the lady was like, "okay Mrs. White we should have it done within the hour," I mean why correct it if it's my destiny?

1813 2018-10-04 20:01:34 It seemed to me that virtually of the snake oil salesmen were lined up within the Remoan campaign.
1814 2018-10-04 20:01:32 As to their Terms & conditions they can technically change anything whenever they want (I think) 

As to @spfootballindex’s point, better to do a U-turn with a fishing boat than an oil tanker? Though I think we’re more medium sized boat rather than a small fisherman’s boat now
1815 2018-10-04 20:01:25 no, what that means is that these guys end up taking donations and then they become incumbent upon the wishes of their donors, and if its Wall Street, and Oil & Gas, well yes, those people want deregulation and Oil & Gas wants to pollute more as you can see today, now radiation

1837 2018-10-04 19:58:05 Hmmmm 20-30 years of ‘snake oil’ ?!?  Err no most of us have had long held opinions not swayed by idiots on either side of the argument.  WE are not stupid, please don’t be stupid
1838 2018-10-04 19:57:20 Shetland in because it has oil, Dumfries and Galloway out because it has err sheep.
1839 2018-10-04 19:57:16 What are you talking about? Here's a good example: bonding requirements for oil and gas drilling were set in the Kennedy administration and never updated. Total requirement: about $10,000. That's absurdly low. I also separated externalities from subsidies in my comments.
1840 2018-10-04 19:56:50 Only I would wash my hair with hair oil thinking its conditioner... can’t even get it out my hair now ffs #getyourgreaseon

1842 2018-10-04 19:56:46 they’re right next door to each other. free dog with oil change. mus and ket ON THE TABLE
1843 2018-10-04 19:55:45 Acknowledge your understanding of the global petroleum markets, so I am sure you will agree with the consensus point that with oil at $100 and trending upward, the main pressures on keeping prices high are the Iran sanctions and unrest in Venezuela? Do you concur?
1844 2018-10-04 19:55:43 Oil and gas is subsidized world wide at ten million per minute according to the IMF. So no oil companies don’t need more.

1846 2018-10-04 19:55:31 But does it contain palm oil that is causing the decimation of the rain forests?

1848 2018-10-04 19:55:27 @claireylegsThat's lovely! You should read the book 'Running Wild' by Michael Morpego. Will open your eyes to the Palm tree oil nightmare.
1849 2018-10-04 19:55:24 No. THEY TALKED TO WITNESSES. Maybe they should have put them on stretching racks to make them confess or maybe boil them in oil.  INQUISITION STYLE
1850 2018-10-04 19:55:24 If y’all are going to be on snap posting videos of you driving listening to music, make sure your check engine light or oil light isn’t lit up. Come on now.
1851 2018-10-04 19:55:21 Lol wait. Y’all don’t change your own oil? Can’t imagine wasting money and waiting for it to be done. Trippin
1852 2018-10-04 19:55:15 When you use peppermint oil to soothe your anxiety but get emotional so you end up rubbing it into your eyes instead. 
1853 2018-10-04 19:55:08 I went to Valvoline to get my oil changed. The guys did a great job. The technician asked, " Is there anything you don't want us to check ?"
I replied, " The blinker fluid! " 
Everyone laughed. I will recommend Valvoline to all my friends.

1858 2018-10-04 19:54:42 The Saudi Government only exists today because of the sacrifices made by our troops. Why?  The answer is “OIL”. Don’t look for any help from Trump.
1859 2018-10-04 19:54:35 Hopefully if we build it they will come.
Time to resist by taking on the oil industry.
Purchase like our country depends on it.

1866 2018-10-04 19:53:54 newww I need to get new tires for my car/oil change/breaks but no motivation to move
1867 2018-10-04 19:53:47 EU can buy oil elsewhere. But Russia can sell elsewhere too. Boycotting Russian oil solves nothing. Use your brain next time.
1868 2018-10-04 19:53:46 And evidence shows cannabis can cure it, but that would shut you down. As it would to many pharmaceutical factories who make billions,,feed fat cats. I've been through it once, next time I'll try the cannabis oil. Seems more effective

1875 2018-10-04 19:53:01 In the span of 10 minutes, my painting professor not only told me that she was going to personally buy me my first full set of oil paints, but also made herself my negotiator/manager Bc my Epcot painting has attracted a lot of customers who want to pay $500+ for commissions
1876 2018-10-04 19:52:33 Hey love, They are fried, but we try to get rid of as much oil as possible.
1877 2018-10-04 19:52:30 Are you sure? Is it really the interest of citizens? Check the international oil price in the past and now. Then check is it really the interest of Citizens of India?
1878 2018-10-04 19:52:24 @cnbc It is obvious that the Chinese are dumping US Treasuries all because of the Tariff war thanks to the WH actions. Putin said it correct when the WH is pushing up oil by its actions, same for the yeild.

Legitimising terrorist, war criminals, and other dubious characters (corrupt men) like Khayre (oil)

1914 2018-10-04 19:46:37 France intervened in Mali, Syria and CAR its former colonies. Britain is playing the ostrich and cutting oil deals to drill oil in the territory whose people it misrepresented to the UN as too poor to be independent. Let truth be told and faced.

1916 2018-10-04 19:46:31 In open war w/China, goods in the US would be rationed, likely incl oil/gas.  I would not want to live in hot, dry, spread-out cities with poor/no public transport.  US demographic patterns past 20 yrs have shown a huge move towards such places, from cities that have the opposite

When Oil has risen sharply the idiot is claiming Price has fallen!! Can’t he just do himself a favor and just SHUT UP.
1920 2018-10-04 19:46:22 He can try to cover up his complicity in the Flake Mockery - but he’s either a sell-out who set his friend ahead of his country, or he’s a complete and utter fool who got used by the snake oil salesman from Arizona.  Either way, he’s no help to Democrats, women, immigrants, etc.

1945 2018-10-04 19:43:43 Haircut and oil change all in one day. Whoaaaa, adulting at its finest.
1946 2018-10-04 19:43:41 I suggest using puretane or butane...you may get less product in the end but the quick rinse method will get u beautiful clearish strong oil
1947 2018-10-04 19:43:38 you should rotate your tires every ten thousand miles and change your oil every 5-7,000 miles. every 3-5 years you should get new tires. if your car seems to be steering not straight, get it realigned
1948 2018-10-04 19:43:38 to support tearing apart earth to create something bad as punishment while the gas and oil companies make money is a sickness to support creating bad foods is a sickness.  MONSANTO is sick.
1949 2018-10-04 19:43:32 What site that shh on bruh lol ?
1950 2018-10-04 19:43:24 I actually don't, which is infuriating. The only major changes have been swapping cooking oil for lowcal sprays, light mayo, and cutting out bread (you're allowed bread but other carbs are free and bread has "syns" and I'd rather use my syns elsewhere)
1951 2018-10-04 19:43:17 MCT oil and whey protein as needed. the former is a tightrope balance between unreal cycling endurance on an empty stomach, and v bad trips to the bathroom.
1952 2018-10-04 19:42:58 More like countering anyone who is ANTI OIL.
1953 2018-10-04 19:42:56 People that eat boiled yam with groundnut oil are cultist
1954 2018-10-04 19:42:47 The us cant last 2 wks without saudi oil  =)
1955 2018-10-04 19:42:44 Lol so Invictus Energy effectively got $25 million worth of research that Mobil had dumped, free of charge, raised only $4 million to complete the research and will be "farming out" the project for ridiculous amounts of money to a big oil company when they're done

Must be nice
1956 2018-10-04 19:42:42 You just put 'em in the press to get dat oil
1957 2018-10-04 19:42:40 MPL oil is doing wonders for my hair .
1958 2018-10-04 19:42:29 Someone please tell me that coconut oil is good for the skin? This is the only skin care routine I’m capable of doing 
1959 2018-10-04 19:42:08 sadly, weedhearts are emphatically not delicious. They're just chunks of infused coconut oil, conveniently separated and (approximately) dosed.

1963 2018-10-04 19:41:30 Don’t mind me as I douse my hair in coconut oil 
1964 2018-10-04 19:41:27 No need to get bothered by junk emails, unless you also object to the ones offering Russian brides or cannabis oil etc!Or am I the only person getting those?
1965 2018-10-04 19:41:22 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
1966 2018-10-04 19:41:15 @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @JohnCornyn @OrrinHatch @ChuckGrassley NONE of you will pass Jon Meachams oil painting test favorably
You will not be judged kindly by historians or history. trump is not worth it.What will your granddaughters say about you?eh-what do girls know anyway
1967 2018-10-04 19:40:51 Oil will drop down to $47.50 and this will help to Make America great again and Global BDI as well
1968 2018-10-04 19:40:47 BJP should sell petrol/ Diesel @ ₹1 and let the fiscal deficit zoom. This way we can make oil PSU bankrupt and all oil imports will be stopped for while.
1969 2018-10-04 19:40:34 We use more oil to extract oil than we get out of it
If it wasnt for government subsidies we would have moved on from oils years ago
1970 2018-10-04 19:40:34 now you turn fish into fish oil and use it to make some gross ass troll bread with weed in it

1980 2018-10-04 19:39:23 They dont have to increase the heat at this mall. Its fall not wintwr. Save ur oil bill .
1981 2018-10-04 19:39:17 Just needs some diligent government attorney willing to burn the 4 p.m. oil.
1982 2018-10-04 19:39:15 Having a car sucks lowkey. You gotta pay for overpriced gas, new tires, oil changes, car washes and check ups

1985 2018-10-04 19:38:58 What about oil?  Carry a bottle in the car ?
1986 2018-10-04 19:38:57 Wow, Heidi has to spend 30 sec talking to an oil lobbyist for that kinda 
1987 2018-10-04 19:38:56 Every time my coworker starts her car it smells like she ain’t changed the oil in yearssss
1988 2018-10-04 19:38:39 I need to put a oil burner in my bathroom
1989 2018-10-04 19:38:22 We seen the bottle but we didn’t see him giving the dog the oil??
1990 2018-10-04 19:38:16 Kogalym? Oil and not much else.
1991 2018-10-04 19:38:06 How many lives have been ruined after being arrested for wanting to use marijuana? Of course its all because hemp is so useful for other things & threatened the oil industry 120 years ago. But really we should have more intelligence. #MarijuanaDebate
1992 2018-10-04 19:38:00 Prices have already gone up and I expect that to continue. Pure logic : weak £ against Euro and $ with a government in power that wants a weak £ , oil prices are in $ meaning continuing rises in fuel. Hauliers having extra costs as well as higher fuel prices . As for the NHS ?
1993 2018-10-04 19:37:54 this morning i went to go get a new set of wheels for my car, an alignment, and an oil change, and now my brakes want to mess around. i swear i cannot be bothered anymore about my car smh
1994 2018-10-04 19:37:53 Argon oil. Need this beard to smell and look fresh.
1995 2018-10-04 19:37:48 Bitch $45 . Next car I’m getting one that take regular gas and regular oil.
1996 2018-10-04 19:37:40 Omg. Get a cup and put in an inch of Olive oil, squeeze of honey, spoon of turmeric& ginger, salt, pepper, spoon of medium curry powder, mix it, cover the cauliflower pieces in it & on a try into the oven @ 220for 20 mins. I had mine w Greek yogurt honestly delish x
1997 2018-10-04 19:37:38 Just look at her  Plenty oil inside rice
1998 2018-10-04 19:37:35 Why are you burning the midnight oil? I guess yesterday was a unproductive day ! 
1999 2018-10-04 19:37:32 Due to the “wildcard” race, Will there be qualifiers like at the Lucas Oil race or just heats straight into b-main/A-Main?
2000 2018-10-04 19:37:25 Whenever I go get my oil changed I'm always afraid imma get my car stuck in the little pit.
2001 2018-10-04 19:37:23 Who’s interested in pure organic CBD products. Oil etc?!?  
You all know what it’s capable of. We’ve been talking about it together for YEARS!  Well now it’s here guys.
2002 2018-10-04 19:37:21 #CHAR simple as we have already started drilling, as we plough through source rocks will be analysed if we get a JV partner ahead of target depth it sure will be a discovery. As no JV partner is silly to risk such a JV deal last minute that would be bad management. #OIL #GAS #LSE
2003 2018-10-04 19:36:56 Macri deriva la publicidad oficial al 13 y encarcela a los dueños de C5N, además de provocar la quiebra de Oil, hacerle un paro como votar en blanco: una troskada.
2004 2018-10-04 19:36:47 See I was thinking making a platform in the ocean but it could be dangerous and it's up to the natives of what to do with the oil, I know it was sold but it was a bad deal and Harper got richer from it and the progressive conservatives.
2005 2018-10-04 19:36:40 never fails that I get hit on when I go to get my oil changed, I’m just trying to get my truck taken care of my dude..
2006 2018-10-04 19:36:24 Use a balm or olive oil before/after. The heat from the last drags dehydrates your lips and can turn them dark Don't be stingy with the last drags.
2007 2018-10-04 19:36:21 Oil are the best, i use coconut oil and carrot oil
2008 2018-10-04 19:36:06 Wonder if this moron understands that Iran can 1) kill the foot soldiers based in Irak & illegally in Syria 2) bomb the oil infrastructure in gulf nations creating a big economic crisis 3) bomb Israel #BoltonTheMoron
2009 2018-10-04 19:35:54 You know when your club has too much dodgy oil money when you spend £60m on Morata! Worst striker in the PL by far!
2010 2018-10-04 19:35:51 Then you need to replace your breather valve which throws the oil in the first place... i have a permanent official VAG solution for that issue... i use these engines a lot to shove in MK2 Golfs and such
2011 2018-10-04 19:35:48 Got my oil changed today only 4 months over due
2012 2018-10-04 19:35:41 I guess I shopped on amazon and forgot. The amount showed in my account and I called for fraud to get money back. woops I guess I butt ordered face oil it’s going to my house and Im getting a refund lmao 
2013 2018-10-04 19:35:37 lmao i’m finally going to get my oil changed
2014 2018-10-04 19:35:28 hard to layoff all those people making and repairing engines, radiators, belts, hoses, manifolds, exhaust sys, alternators, lead batteries, generators, filters, plugs, pollution control units, transmissions, oil pans, non-regen brakes, axle makers, idiot lights, gauges, fans, etc
2015 2018-10-04 19:35:24 @BritishGasHelp Hello, my parents want to switch from oil to gas and need a supply and meter installed. They called and were told that this isn’t a service BG provide but just checked the website and it says you do? Can you confirm if you install new meters for new supply?
2016 2018-10-04 19:35:22 that is an old picture from a high school presentation on refined oil

2019 2018-10-04 19:34:46 "India is facing economic crisis due to huge oil imports"-A homily being offered by BJP Ministers across the board not solutions.
2020 2018-10-04 19:34:43 I use almond oil or apricot seed oil $3.95 at my local health food store. Hell, olive oil does the trick. I don’t break out. I wear a full face daily.
2021 2018-10-04 19:34:38 yes. apparently you guys would be just fine right now if you immediately dropped oil lol
2022 2018-10-04 19:34:04 ask @TeckResources ... they probably plan to sell to a foreign company once they have the sham NEB's rubber stamp.

e.g. China, who in turn get oil secured from source to refined fuel. they'd be happy to buy the KM pipeline and this mine. 

how is this in our national interest?
2023 2018-10-04 19:33:51 I have a long response to this.
1) Every entrepreneur is successful until he fails. Most startups fail. 
2) This was used by Obama to change mindset of no jobs (outside of labor work/oil), leading to huge unemployment and poverty. 
3) The impact will be seen for years to come
2024 2018-10-04 19:33:50 I bought some Jamaican black castor oil today and I’m honestly excited to see this journey

2026 2018-10-04 19:33:20 everyone’s wastefulness. oil companies are doing their jobs of keeping things running, keeping up with demand, and many are working to make sure oil is produced in the most environmentally friendly way possible
2027 2018-10-04 19:33:15 Do they actually say we (vzla) should have diversified our economy? That's fucking rich considering how our reliance on oil rent was caused by foreign (mostly US) oil companies coming here to exploit resources in the first place.
2028 2018-10-04 19:32:56 My boyfriend does all my car maintenance, I wake up to him washing my car all the time and changing my oil. Anytime I drive far he checks my car before I leave to make sure I’ll be safe. He shows me the purest love
2029 2018-10-04 19:32:51 Good! Why in the name of Christ do we have a dairy cartel? Oh wait... to pander to the eastern provinces. Much like the auto industry. Why not support the economic powerhouse of the country - oil and gas. It’s what drives this country and enables the outrageous transfer payments.
2030 2018-10-04 19:32:42 So you want to start using oil
2031 2018-10-04 19:32:39 Also think of this.  If you couldn't win when everything was in your favour.  What chance next time?  You won't get a two year campaign to ram your lies down our throats.  You won't get to lie about oil, currency and our NHS.  

Scots throughout the UK should get to vote.
2032 2018-10-04 19:32:34 someone i know will ingest the oil and smoking right after.. this will ensure you have instant effects and once the flower effects are wearing out the oil effect will kick in

2034 2018-10-04 19:32:28 coooooool
except refineries in eastern canada cant process oil sand bitumen. EE was an export pipeline and wouldnt change oil imports.
but you already knew this
2035 2018-10-04 19:32:24 Quoting a natural resources policy expert courtesy of @Leonardoruko.."water is a renewable and fugitive resource as opposed to oil which is exhaustable and resident"...therefore it is erroneous for Muranga to equate their situation with Turkana County!
2036 2018-10-04 19:32:14 In view of drug prices, anyone ever think to ask Gates, Zuckerberg,  Buffett, et al why they dont start a pharmaceutical company to produce orphan or out of patent drugs at cost? 
They are certainly rich enough to finance it.
2037 2018-10-04 19:32:00 Coconut oil is the best thing on earth, there’s nothing it can’t fix!! Wish I could put it on the boyfriend I don’t have, cause I’m sure it would fix him too.

2040 2018-10-04 19:31:18 Fixing a MAP sensor issue on a 5 cylinder is not something that stays fixed for long. It needs a custom fix lol. Oil seeps into the sensor and throws readings off randomly.
2041 2018-10-04 19:31:02 Im finna take my ass to the pipeline/oil field. Hell we got midterms next week and I don’t remember a bitch ass thang
2042 2018-10-04 19:31:00 i honestly owe thieves oil my life i just put some on my chest behind my ears and in my mouth we love thieves oil 
2043 2018-10-04 19:30:59 it’s currently the most efficient and cost effective. we live in a first world country  where we can begin to use less oil, but you have to realize that ppl in other countries still heat their homes with firewood. oil is a resource that can help many. of course in moderation

2054 2018-10-04 19:29:15 US diplomacy was instrumental in Turkmenistan granting a license to the Unocal & Delta Oil’s pipeline project with its extension to India & also extended credit to India to ensure its capability to participate (1996)..

2064 2018-10-04 19:27:42 First: you need spaghetti! Second: you need much more oil than that...the garlic is not fried...but sauté!! Fucking hell...why would you put a fucking chicken in it!!
2065 2018-10-04 19:27:41 Really excited that they replaced the old President of the World Chess Federation - ousted for helping ISIS sell its oil - with, uh... *looks down at paper* ...Dmitry Medvedev's second-in-command. Thank goodness the corruption is finally at an end.
2066 2018-10-04 19:27:28 When Farm Bill passes, will $KSHB see USA territorial expansion and exponential sales growth? Not likely.  

But $CVSI will in all 50 States with its CBD hemp oil products.

Better valuation? $KSHB at $457 Million, or $CVSI at $376 Million.

Long both.

2072 2018-10-04 19:26:49 HELLO??? Do you only watch Hannity??? Trump's a grifter, bigot, low information disaster.  "Don't believe what you see, believe what I tell you" snake oil salesman.  People who know how to verify facts KNOW he's awful.  What's your excuse?
2073 2018-10-04 19:26:44 None of these appear to be impeachable offenses at the moment. It’s an interesting (read:disturbing) moment in US history.
2074 2018-10-04 19:26:43 She said that we need to send Hispanic people fleeing violence in Latin America back to send a message. She said/did nothing to express support for indigenous people fighting against an oil pipeline which would run through their land in North Dakota. Politics is not just about

Burns in freedom cooling oil
2079 2018-10-04 19:26:08 To be fair, if they sat down to compose poems about or make oil paintings of their cappuccinos, Plato would think they were wasting their time as well.
2080 2018-10-04 19:26:08 You are very silly! Despite oil boom during OBJ, Yar'Adua & GEJ's administrations, they couldn't build more schools & enroll more children. You should know that Boko Haram & conflicts happening in the NC contributed to the slight increase in the number of out of school children.
2081 2018-10-04 19:26:02 [food]

Potato/root veg, oil, dried rosemary, cheese if desired/able to consume.

Chop up potato, peeling if desired, toss in oil and salt and spice of choice (rosemary/thyme are some of my faves) oven roast until soft, throw cheese on during last few min/after cooking

2084 2018-10-04 19:25:25 The olive oil ones. I bought the full dry ones too just to give it a shot and I don’t really like them. Although I’m sautéing the full dry ones right now to see if I like them other ways!

2087 2018-10-04 19:25:16 It’s been an hour an a half and I’m still waiting for my car to be done from an oil change. #bullshit #tired
2088 2018-10-04 19:25:03 Our military is butressing a bloated empire fighting phantom enemies in the name of oil, opium & minerals...
2089 2018-10-04 19:24:59 I wish I was confident at frying stuff in lots of oil, I get really nervy with a bit pan of boiling oil.
2090 2018-10-04 19:24:57 Come oil me up first
2091 2018-10-04 19:24:48 I actually don’t know my registration expired, I need an oil change & I now need to find more merch .-. My wallets not looking so healthy
2092 2018-10-04 19:24:47 @camilluddington as Lara Croft. There's a scene particularly in the oil refinery level that I thought was a brilliant performance.

2095 2018-10-04 19:24:23 The nasty hot oil burn I got earlier hurts less than listening to Grassley's #misogyny. Could he and is Good Ol' Boys band at least reimburse me for the extra counseling I'll need now? #StopKavanaugh
2096 2018-10-04 19:24:19 And that can only be profitable if trade is open to both India and CA.. they expect to make money (plus geostrategic gobbledegook) in traditional ways, not by shipping oil over mountains to Western China which already has enuff oil..

2100 2018-10-04 19:23:51 मतलब FM और PM झूट बोल रहे हें. दुनिया की सबसे फ़ास्ट बढ़ने वाली इकॉनमी. २००९-२०१४oil prices $१०५ से नीचे नहीं आए थे. $१४७ टच हुवे थे २००८ में मंदी आयी थी फिर भी इकॉनमी सम्भाली. आज oil prices $८५ हें. दुनिया में मंदी नहीं हें फिर भी ये हालत हें. अच्छे दिन?

2107 2018-10-04 19:22:42 Liberals and logic are two mutually exclusive concepts...like oil and water...
2108 2018-10-04 19:22:33 What do mean? They told you net cash end q3. U can work out cash generation over year and you can guess with some certainty from working capital adjustment September Dyas free cash. You know it is 50% of group and you know oil is higher cash profit per barrel. Info all out there
2109 2018-10-04 19:22:27 Was govt official announce to seek oil on deffered payment from saudia?
2110 2018-10-04 19:22:18 me when I put any type of oil in my hair:
" Omg why is my hair so oily!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" 

2111 2018-10-04 19:22:02 Where do you think all our minerals came from ? Do you really believe Dinosaurs created all the oil on our Planet ? Did you know there is a solid diamond Planet in Space ? We've been lied to , badly.

2112 2018-10-04 19:22:00 I miss roasted yam and utazi with red oil, tomato and onions.

It's been ages.

Igbos will soon lose this amazing delicacy.

Love those climbers. Mehn, it's been long gathering around a mortar for a heavenly dip.

To think that I didn't quite appreciate it growing up   
2113 2018-10-04 19:21:49 Cut in half, toss in olive oil, salt, and pepper, roast at 450 until you're worried that they're too dark. (I like my brussel sprouts REALLY roasted, YMMV) and then I add lemon juice and parm and toss to combine. I had some with asiago and rosemary that were AMAZING the other day
2114 2018-10-04 19:21:49 That's how exactly how I feel when it comes to opening this bottle of CBD oil I have. It's a nightmare because it takes literally at least 15 seconds and all the strength in your arms because it doesn't catch on the threads due to the oil.
2115 2018-10-04 19:21:45 Locals oil, water, et al saga. We don’t learn! You just can’t take resources from a certain space and leave locals languishing in need/poverty. Involve the people in a mature way - not chest thumping, old fashioned demos, innuendoes, insinuations and primitive tactics.
2116 2018-10-04 19:21:31 That's exactly what I see as well. The Fox channel has a stronghold throughout America, i.e., playing in most business lobbies.  Getting an oil change or having a Dr. appt. shouldn't cause me an anxiety attack having to watch Fox.  Somehow, they captured the attention of idiots.
2117 2018-10-04 19:21:31 Oil change

2120 2018-10-04 19:21:04 The 5₹ reduction of Petrol prices in select states has soothed them. The Crises mode -Oil Price coinciding with Fall of Ind ₹73.78 against US$ is far worrying. The revenue loss by lowering petrol prices ≠ Scammer loss felt by India. Common Man's Burdens are Heavier today!
2121 2018-10-04 19:21:03 Make me understand this: after fuel prices go up by 20 Rs, they get cut by Rs 2 and we ‘celebrate’? What happens now if oil crosses $100 a barrel? Is fuel state controlled or market driven or festival/election driven?
2122 2018-10-04 19:21:03 @realScottWagner you idiot. Body heat does NOT cause global warming you baffoon. Stick the 200k up your ass from the oil and gas industry. Loser!

2128 2018-10-04 19:20:38 y does everyone act like women don’t know when to get their oil changed??? Contrary to popular belief we’re not fucking stupid.

2136 2018-10-04 19:19:44 I used to take fish oil supplements and my hair was super shiny lol collagen prolly got u looking 10 years younger huh
2137 2018-10-04 19:19:25 Of course - it’s because natural rapeseed oil is very high in acid and unpalatable and the Canola cultivars have about 3% of that acid content and are still noticably different to the tounge

2143 2018-10-04 19:18:35 @TheTweetOfGod Dear lord, severe hot oil burn I managed to get earlier hurts less than listening to @ChuckGrassley's tone def misogyny. Please bring us verbal smites of comfort.
2144 2018-10-04 19:18:31 Oh rip I thought you had oil money for some reason  how much was inzaghi? 200k or 250? You're better off getting any normal striker and play him there maybe aguero?

2161 2018-10-04 19:16:53 Once you inject contaminants into the formation under pressure to fracture bedrock to remove oil you loose control of where those fluids migrate and increase the likelihood of contaminating groundwater aquifers.  In addition, the burn off of excess natural gas pollutes air.

2165 2018-10-04 19:16:43 Sir, the Central Govt can cut further. They have been getting a lot of tax when the International oil prices were low and in fact the increase versus decrease is negligible. Why is the State being burdened?
2166 2018-10-04 19:16:42 you see olive oil is just too spicy for some
2167 2018-10-04 19:16:36 Oil will still be but not to extent we use it now,
Just like lead we still use it but not like before.
Just like workers automation will make us absolete but their will be a % of us working

2174 2018-10-04 19:15:38 China’s need for oil will bring her to the Mideast with that in mind, another hook in the jaw. We know how this ends
2175 2018-10-04 19:15:28 and the heady smell of burning oil...!
2176 2018-10-04 19:15:24 Use cornstarch to soak up oil. Let it for 5 mins and sweep. If still slick, go over it wil a slice of bread. Sweep and then mop your floor with warm water and dawn. It has to be a dish soap that cuts oil.
2177 2018-10-04 19:15:20 The two (Mullah's/IRGC) will squeeze dollars from every Iranian that's sick or needy to try and makeup for lost oil revenue and call it the Martyrs economy or similar wording

2186 2018-10-04 19:14:38 Is CBD oil illegal? I’ve seen it in CVS and Rite Aid. I thought CBD oil doesn’t contain THC?

2191 2018-10-04 19:14:15 In oil production it's the end user where the emissions are counted why can't same happen to food.

2193 2018-10-04 19:14:11 This region once produced more oil than anywhere else in Europe.
2194 2018-10-04 19:13:59 Sounds awesome. These are in balsamic and olive oil too, with oregano - it's a great but simple @antoninaparker recipe
2195 2018-10-04 19:13:49 This season of @serial is too good so they had to ruin it by running @ZipRecruiter ads about finding the right guy to drill for oil
2196 2018-10-04 19:13:36 This had to happen. Importing tonnes of oil, paying for it in INR, less exports and more duties n taxes on fuel. THIS WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN.

After all, we chose a tea vendor to rule us!! LMAO @narendramodi
2197 2018-10-04 19:13:24 Actually maybe on the new maps they should have all the oil rigs, fishing zones, wind and tide turbines marked
2198 2018-10-04 19:13:21 Regular olive oil was too spicy, I guess.

2200 2018-10-04 19:13:09 How do people not see that this will decrease the demand for oil?  Building new infrastructure for an industry that's being phased out is insanity.

2203 2018-10-04 19:12:37 They won't get richer so to say, but they can make up some of the losses from less oil sales, that's why the IRGC/Mullah's won't go to the UN & setup an oil for food & medicine program, they need the shortages of Med's/food & other essentials to profit from IRGC smuggling

2205 2018-10-04 19:12:22 How kids get helped with CBD oil in treatments, how THC is less destructive on young peoples then fucking OPIOIDS and AMPHETAMINES that is getting prescribes in bulk.

Its not perfect to joke around and it gets to a point where its anti-constructive, see helicoptermemes

2207 2018-10-04 19:12:21 ‘People standing on a stage talking about the #futureofwork - more like the land of snake oil!’ Great to hear the FoW BS get called out for what it is at today’s event. 
2208 2018-10-04 19:12:21 Why can't India buy oil from Russia in Rupee Ruble trade to compensate for Irani oil due to sanctions?
2209 2018-10-04 19:12:21 why would he do that using the wrong oil is surely gonna cost more in the long term?
2210 2018-10-04 19:12:13 I instinctively like these deterministic arguments when they're presented in favour of divestment and "oil is a bubble", but instinctively don't like them when they're presented as a reason why we don't need political action and behavioural change. So I need to reconcile that 
2211 2018-10-04 19:12:12 Petrol and Diesel should not come under GST. The volitality in the oil market is evident but bringing it under GST would be a blunder as the state and central revenue would plummet. Consumer positivity and not desperation is the need of the hour for indian markets. #FuelPriceCut

2217 2018-10-04 19:11:25 I was talking about funding across all UK, not just Scotland, you get the most, then Ireland, Wales and last England. It’s Scotland still self funding with the oil price drop?
2218 2018-10-04 19:11:23 El oil panic no puede ser reflejado de ninguna manera así que nope
2219 2018-10-04 19:11:17 Boy yeen said nothing slick to a can of oil  and I just started and shit
2220 2018-10-04 19:10:55 Yes, I'm sure your "career staff" DOES protect human health and the environment. But since you are in power, and are working instead to protect big oil/gas/chem/coal industry... that has been an uphill battle! #PlanetBeforeProfit #RESIGN
2221 2018-10-04 19:10:54 Sanj, crude oil surge is killing Sri Lanka  and other emerging markets. Eye of U.S Sanctions against Iran . I hope  Saudi and OPEC will step up to help the markets 
2222 2018-10-04 19:10:42 プランDB
2223 2018-10-04 19:10:38 how the fuck can oil be mild
2224 2018-10-04 19:10:26 Overseas oil patch is what’s next. I realize when I say I’m doing stuff it happens really easily so that’s what I’m doing next. Think of how jacked and tan I would be in Asia or Australia flipping out on lazy cunts with dumb accents.

2226 2018-10-04 19:10:19 Clarksville Friends! I have two upcoming essential oil classes I wanted to invite y'all too. 

10/16: 11am
10/24: 6:30pm

Both classes are at my house. Comment below if you would like to be added to my private event :)
2227 2018-10-04 19:10:17 Roasted cremini mushrooms are great, cheap, and they feel like nice pub food. Wash 'em, cut off the stems, toss in olive oil (you can use less because they're juicy), salt and pepper. garlic/lemon optional. place on baking sheet flat side down. 400 degrees 20-30 minutes.
2228 2018-10-04 19:10:08 Lavender oil, head massage, loud singing and kitchen dancing.
2229 2018-10-04 19:10:04 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2230 2018-10-04 19:10:02 Who paid TURKANA for 'their' oil and why  ?? So oil is an artificial resource while water is a natural one !
2231 2018-10-04 19:09:24 For some reason I can’t explain, peak relation for me is reading a magazine in a waiting room. I LOVE sitting in a waiting room at like, the auto body place while the dude changes my oil. I love it. Plastic cups of coffee and shit.
2232 2018-10-04 19:09:11 Do you guys pay attention to whether the oil your using is sealing vs moisturizing? do you care? did you know there was a difference? 
2233 2018-10-04 19:09:09 Ice breaker  #InteriorsChat I want to say cinnamon, especially at this time of year, but I've recently indulged in an @aromaassoc bath oil & now I'm on the hunt for a candle which smells the same. My house has smelt like a spa for the last week  Any recommendations?
2234 2018-10-04 19:09:06 Abis selesai order product skincare yg berbasis organic gtu oil dll.. kebetulan lumayan ada cashback dr shopee 25rb (emak2 bgt gue) yg penting muka kinclong beras aman yeh hahaha. Rencana ini skincare bakalan gue pake bareng laki gue hha (ok sekali lagi gue ogah rugi). 
2235 2018-10-04 19:09:06 A whole oil refinery. Bet you there’s some ponce who retweeted that thinking oil refinery = cheaper fuel. 

 We are a gullible nation. Don’t even question or bother to understand, sometimes. Read and believe. 
2236 2018-10-04 19:08:44 I used to put iodine in the baby oil! For extra crispy chicken. 
2237 2018-10-04 19:08:42 Ages ago had a portion of McD's chips. Tasted like they'd been fried in motor oil. Sore throat for a week after. Never since, and never again. 
2238 2018-10-04 19:08:25 Goan return it, use the money to buy torch. Shebi you have plate at home, borrow red oil from someone
2239 2018-10-04 19:08:20 내 생각에는 트위터에서 떠도는 우울증으로 인한 정신병 같은데 의사 쌤이 신경병이래
2240 2018-10-04 19:08:15 omg he said this orange essential oil made him excited and i wondered if it helped with motivation so i asked but i didn't ask him like that it was like ,"what do you mean excited" and i think he took it in the wrong way omg
2241 2018-10-04 19:08:14 #FuelPriceCut Scary, on the government plan. The model won't sustain as the oil makers are taking a hit of 1₹ loss on a litre. Furthermore has the government gotany plans if rupee goes down south and becomes 75 or barrel hits 100$.
2242 2018-10-04 19:07:51 Last preseason game vs Oil. Flames outshot them about 43-21 but lose. They out shoot Nucks last night 35-23 and lose 5-2. So maybe not ALL on Smith but seems like there's a lot of other keepers out there standing on their heads! Markstrom- Talbot. So not moving their feet? Shots?
2243 2018-10-04 19:07:43 I don’t have bleached hair but I find Aussie products really good! They have a 3-Miracle oil that I put in after every swim.

2247 2018-10-04 19:07:32 Tonight’s Grilled Flatbread Pizza
Roasted Red Peppers, Grilled Summer Squash & Zucchini, Garlic Oil “White Pizza”… $12.50
2248 2018-10-04 19:07:30 Maybe it could do 75 CPS when the bearings were new and the oil was fresh, but now it can’t run as fast? (just speculating).
2249 2018-10-04 19:07:25 A self portrait about 96”x48”. Make it an oil painting

2251 2018-10-04 19:07:21 She’s also dealing with a gender gap that’s been exacerbated by the oil boom. North Dakota is 48.7% female. National average is 50.8%. Given how white and male her state is, Heitkamp had a major disadvantage. White males have polarized toward the GOP big time.
2252 2018-10-04 19:07:20 This country is a super oil supplier to South Africa,it gonna happen
2253 2018-10-04 19:07:18 Autism too. Met a guy yesterday using cannabis for disc pain. Hemp oil wud be nice, to fill the car up. Clothing, fashion, medicine, travel, and jobs.....but, no. We get harsher laws. Creative aren't they.
2254 2018-10-04 19:07:13 LGC unfortunately don't get blessed with TRY 1000x revs Mcap.

The market needs to see revs and I'm betting on crude CBD oil  exports from Jamaica to be the main contributor.
2255 2018-10-04 19:07:07 Hello @Ms_chic mama christmas has heard your cries and courtsey @kehindeGeorge_  you get a bottle of carolina herrera good girl perfume oil.

2256 2018-10-04 19:07:05 Cooking oil lol
2257 2018-10-04 19:07:05 Well, we could always start testing the concept on our imports of US, Saudi, Nigerian etc oil.
2258 2018-10-04 19:07:03 Yet those are things he is getting rid of.  

Or we can talk about regulations, many of which were created after a disaster to prevent it from happening again (like regulations born out of the deep water horizon oil spill).  Yet he is getting rid of them, putting people at risk.
2259 2018-10-04 19:06:47 Dealer Oil Changes gives me something to do with walking around looking at new cars and walking out to lunch
2260 2018-10-04 19:06:23 #king has been protected by its gigantic oil reserves 
2261 2018-10-04 19:06:11 Baby oil sex 
2262 2018-10-04 19:06:09 Secret of success with any extractive: replace the value you remove below the ground with equivalent value above ground. Consumption, broad subsidies cheap $ mean that when the oil value falls..you are left with nothing.
2263 2018-10-04 19:06:05 And you dare keeping stating that has nothing to do with sections implemented on Iranian oil.. If you're still not convinced yet, stay tuned.. that's just the beginning.
2264 2018-10-04 19:05:57 Pour Anointing oil, wake up every 2hrs in the night and peep tru the window to check oo.
2265 2018-10-04 19:05:56 $CPG Or a stellar pick as the transition to a profitable, disciplined oil company unfolds.
2266 2018-10-04 19:05:54 I can’t suspend it dear, I have already bought calabash and red oil
2267 2018-10-04 19:05:47 Looks like an Oil waifu than Lizard.
2268 2018-10-04 19:05:43 Hypothetically, let’s say you were playing around too much & spilled a lot of canola oil. Hypothetically, let’s say you cleaned it up, washed the floor, put alcohol on said floor, and then put power down and cleaned it up again.

2271 2018-10-04 19:05:35 I heard taking a spoonful of oil before drinking will help lube up your insides so that you don't get hungover. I know that's irrelevant to this convo just wanted to share lmao
2272 2018-10-04 19:05:30 Have your band overdone it with the Oil of Olay though? :-)
2273 2018-10-04 19:05:30 I need to do an oil change and a car wash today but like also too lazy to get up rn
2274 2018-10-04 19:05:11 Glad you are feeling better!! Stick to great radio and leave bottled potions and vomit  to the snake oil salesmen!!!

2276 2018-10-04 19:05:05 Tell him when the oil eventually gets burned, it contributes to climate change!! Also the building of the pipeline also most likely emits more carbon
2277 2018-10-04 19:05:00 i need new oil paints
2278 2018-10-04 19:04:49 Oil provides transportation, oil is on his way out but even 30-50 years from now we will still have viable uses for it lawn mowers, atvs, transporting goods ect. Transportation is always evolving. But there will still be a % of people using oil based products as with plastic
2279 2018-10-04 19:04:47 I have collected every PFD since the first one in 1982. I like it but don’t need it. In light of State deficit and < oil royalties, I support developing a needs-based criteria for future PFD distributions and even more aggressive action against snowbirds who fraudulently apply.
2280 2018-10-04 19:04:36 Is it cos I’m old that every time I go in @NBHDRestaurants Leeds I get really irritated when people are sat atop the backs of the seats with their feet on the actual seat? Why don’t they get done?  get ya creps off sofa, ya mam would gi u a clip round lug oil at home
2281 2018-10-04 19:04:32 $CPG We respect your bearish outlook for CPG. You certainly have company. It could turn out to be one of the biggest duds in the oil patch.
2282 2018-10-04 19:04:32 Rub is no longer dependent on oil. Just capital flows. Oil in rub terms 5700 ever record
2283 2018-10-04 19:04:30 Gold, silver, oil--in these manic times none are so rare a commodity as reason.
2284 2018-10-04 19:04:28 Time to take this down. You lost.
2285 2018-10-04 19:04:26 Too much chili oil ™.
2286 2018-10-04 19:04:18 Hope she never finds out where canola oil comes from.
2287 2018-10-04 19:04:11 Hi everyone! I'm Molly from the Chaser team here in London. We're burning the midnight oil here too :) #QBOchat
2288 2018-10-04 19:04:08 LAPD when folks don’t complain: you need to say something- the squeaky wheel gets the oil
LAPD when you exercise your right to complain: who gave you this number? I don’t really have an answer for you
2289 2018-10-04 19:04:05 Rand Paul's wife pens letter to Booker following protests, threats against husband: POOR CUNT ! DOESN'T EVEN KNOW SHE MARRIED TO A CORRUPT REPUBLICUNT "OIL" HOOD HIDIN' UP IN "KUNTUCKY" !!!
2290 2018-10-04 19:04:04 Yes some relief, real problem will start from next month i.e. 1st of November where Iran will banned Oil exports to all the countries and India is one of the major importer of crude oil from Iran after China. "Get Ready" #FuelPriceCut
2291 2018-10-04 19:03:56 A little gift from Benjamin Netanyahu  and Trump's Administration to the world..

"Oil prices tumbled as much as 3 percent on Thursday, pulling back sharply after rallying to four-year highs on concerns about the fallout of U.S. sanctions on Iran,

2293 2018-10-04 19:03:36 Canada signed this agreement, but that doesn't mean you have to buy anything American. Put a massive tariff on the oil you send
2294 2018-10-04 19:03:32 Where is oil minister  n finance minister did we vote for this why cant minister cut their convoy #FuelPriceCut
2295 2018-10-04 19:03:25 Did you not follow the news that outlined all the people the FBI was instructed NOT to talk to? The "investigation" was a charade designed to oil the gears to confirm a man who is not fit for SCOTUS. Did you see the list of organizations that agree with me? ABA, Harvard Law, etc.
2296 2018-10-04 19:03:24 Also, fresh asparagus (when you can get it). Olive oil, salt, pepper, some balsamic vinegar, 425 for 15-20 mins.
2297 2018-10-04 19:03:23 High cbd oil may help with pain.  I hope you start feeling better.
2298 2018-10-04 19:03:00 “We’ve gone to extra lengths to find alternative sellers of oil” for those who have been importing energy supplies from #Iran, according to @AmbJohnBolton.
2299 2018-10-04 19:02:42 Tariq gives off snake oil salesman vibes, but I think I prefer him over these “blavitys”.
2300 2018-10-04 19:02:38 Cook up some Pancetta in a pan, reserve the grease. Toss Brussels in a light coat of olive oil, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning. Use pancetta oil to roast them. Grate fresh parm or citrus zest on top at the end.
2301 2018-10-04 19:02:32 Roast frozen broccoli! Easy, lazy, delicious. Salt, pepper, olive oil, 400 degrees for about 15-20 mins. You want it to be brown on the ends and crunchy!
2302 2018-10-04 19:02:30 #FuelPriceCut
Agar international market main crude oil $90/barrel hai to domestic market main petrol Rs.50/litre hona chahiye ye Jatley saheb ne opposition main rehte huwe kaha tha. Aaj $86 hai phir Rs50/- se kam kyun nahi kar rahe. Kisne rok rakha hai ?
2303 2018-10-04 19:02:29 Lmao dude. Corporations are taking indigenous land left and right. All these oil pipelines? On indigenous land. Pls just do some minor research before you spout this denialist bullshit
2304 2018-10-04 19:02:21 Deepak__Jain I'm so sorry!  I hope you can find Elderberry Extract, Oregano Oil and Zinc Acetate Lozenges. These are excellent to have on hand and particularly when you first feel the cold coming on. They will still shorten the cold and its effects. RT

2306 2018-10-04 19:02:06 Well we can stop buying things if we know they r Chinese but an end to oil sales to China would hurt more. #c4news
2307 2018-10-04 19:01:58 The govt could've massively cut/largely removed highway Toll charges with the extra excise duty earned from high oil taxes.

2309 2018-10-04 19:01:27 Lol. Censorship like mad. My friend who works for an oil company said they were given phones without  a camera.
2310 2018-10-04 19:01:15 Bought my dogs cbd oil at a pet store so that’s kinda cool.
2311 2018-10-04 19:01:05 Despite her 'bluster and show,' she will STILL vote for Kavanaugh. She, Murkowski and Flake are a lot of BS. Ultimately, they always go with the Republicans. Murkowski sold out Alaska to the oil companies for $$$

2317 2018-10-04 19:00:23 If you have dry eyes, your doctor may have prescribed you special eye drops to keep your eyes lubricated and comfortable. Wearing sunglasses, staying hydrated, and taking fish oil can also help your eyes stay comfortable.

2323 2018-10-04 18:59:46 I'm a lifelong D who's now going to vote straight R. I voted for Obama the first time, abstained the second time. Also didn't vote for Trump OR Hillary in 2016. Still pro-choice & not 100% opposed to moderate dem policies but can't support the BS and violence.
2324 2018-10-04 18:59:46 Yeah my family has been around this area forever, since 1880 to be exact. Kip never brings up my Great Grampa being one of the first the first independent teamsters hauling oil. But hey Red Ryan. Hell my Grampa Jack was running rum in those days. But Red Ryan.
2325 2018-10-04 18:59:41 Make me understand this: after fuel prices go up by 20 Rs, they get cut by Rs 2 and we ‘celebrate’? What happens now if oil crosses $100 a barrel? Is fuel state controlled or market driven or festival/election driven?
2326 2018-10-04 18:59:19 Americans only care about Americans and oil hope they know that
2327 2018-10-04 18:59:17 She put some type of lemon tea tree oil on me and this shit is heavenly

2348 2018-10-04 18:57:18 Lmao that joint was lit and it was pretty good too. It’s hard to get edibles moist like regular snacks tho cuz weed oil is different from other cooking oils
2349 2018-10-04 18:57:17 #BBN - We all have a responsibility to keep the mojo going for @UKFootball. My beard is past the itchy faze and I am shopping for beard oil.
Are you doing anything to keep the mojo going?
2350 2018-10-04 18:57:16 Yeah, and also, every attempt to socially engineer equal outcomes has been an abject failure.

Meritocracy is more worth striving for than representation. At least you filter out the snake oil salesmen.
2351 2018-10-04 18:57:09 My favs: carrots & butternut squash in butter & maple syrup, cauliflower in oil & curry blend, broccoli in oil & garlic, eggplant in oil & oregano, zucchini in oil & rosemary
2352 2018-10-04 18:56:58 Bring me a stake sub lettuce, mayo, salt, pepper vinegar oil, and chips tell em I said put it on my tab
2353 2018-10-04 18:56:54 Its absurd that you claim that water flowing to nairobi is yours. Ndakaini is merely a reservoir/ store for water from other areas. It doesnt belong to you. Oil is drilled in Turkana, water is not in Muranga.
2354 2018-10-04 18:56:49 How many people didnt March that wanted to? How many people march against Monsanto, big oil, BLM, etc. I’m inferring a lot, so if u have stats I’d be happy to read. If the women’s march was anti Trump, it was putting forward hate towards him or a Trumpian idea.
2355 2018-10-04 18:56:46 울 모까 할로윈 의상 사야하나
2356 2018-10-04 18:56:45 Have you not seen the latest oil prices?
2357 2018-10-04 18:56:36 c02 carts and vapcap M for vaping flower. Hardly smoke it anymore, effects are vastly increased and you can taste the terps for real :) and I won’t even touch a cart with dilutants anymore. VG coconut oil MCT no matter it tastes like shit and dilutes the medicine.
2358 2018-10-04 18:56:31 Oh publicly...One oil tycoon who is no longer with us. One rich prick from the '70s who made it on his WASP-y "heritage," never mind all the crap of a different nature dealt with at Duke U. Med.
2359 2018-10-04 18:56:27 well @BioOilUS offered me £5k to be their first bio oil athlete but i turned it down, im retiring on top of the game with a peak 1 rep bench of 150kg, thanks for the cheese im out
2360 2018-10-04 18:56:21 Am I the only female that gets attacked while going to see a mechanic for an oil change? Like they always find something to try and make me pay extra
2361 2018-10-04 18:56:11 Chelugui ought to give us the difference between water the natural resources and oil from turkana period. U allowed the arm twisting by the  turkana leadership you must cheap in something to the muranga natives .
2362 2018-10-04 18:56:10 Where's my baby oil?
2363 2018-10-04 18:56:02 A molecule is a molecule, I would take the whole crop and turn it into distillate oil.
2364 2018-10-04 18:55:57 فضل من الله لا تسوي طالع منها انت 
2365 2018-10-04 18:55:38 Oil Change instructions for Women:

1) Pull up to Jiffy Lube when the mileage reaches 3000 miles since the last oil change.
2) Drink a cup of coffee.
3) 15 minutes later, pay and leave with an improperly maintained vehicle.
4) End up having to buy a new engine/car.
2366 2018-10-04 18:55:22 I just wish oil changes were like five bucks because i always end up getting sold on new filters, new wipers and basically a new car every time
2367 2018-10-04 18:55:11 Daily oil massage, #Abhyanga, is a cornerstone of #dinacharya, the #Ayurvedic daily routine that promotes health and longevity.
2368 2018-10-04 18:55:04 No one from the swamp is held to account... ever... Wanted to believe, but not buying snake oil anymore
2369 2018-10-04 18:55:01 Cut them in half, put them in a pan with olive oil and seasoning (black pepper, cayenne, crushed red pepper etc) for like 5min. Then put them face-down on a cookie sheet at 425 for 20min. I like to add strips of red pepper for sweetness. After, add Parmesan and sriracha sauce
2370 2018-10-04 18:55:01 Middle Eastern oil mogul come here uuuu 
2371 2018-10-04 18:54:51 I hate grind eventsssssssssssssss there's nothing more annoying like overflowing with oil and suddenly have NONE
2372 2018-10-04 18:54:50 Wish I could hang out more, but horror stuff and I aren't friendly. In fact, oil and water have a better relationship. But it's good to catch you while I can handle it.
2373 2018-10-04 18:54:48 Not if you make it yourself with sunflower oil instead of soy !
2374 2018-10-04 18:54:18 Still, digestion aside, an occasional salad can be a great vehicle for olive oil, meats and cheeses 
2375 2018-10-04 18:54:07 Tonight’s Appetizer Special

2376 2018-10-04 18:54:02 Thank you Cory for being a fighter. Afraid it's the dems job to keep reaching across the isle. It's hard because the GOP just wants to name call, distract and get nothing really done, except get job with lobbyist/oil after they retire from the senate. Thanks for all you do!
2377 2018-10-04 18:53:46 decided to get an oil change today and lololol i'll leave this shit to my uncle
2378 2018-10-04 18:53:44 No!! But I actually decided to do the right thing and plug it in while I’m sitting at the dealership getting my oil changed. 

Some Starbucks in the city don’t have working outlets so people won’t stay more than an hour or so. That’s often where I get bamboozled w/ 8% battery
2379 2018-10-04 18:53:38 u can mix vinegar with olive oil half in half and put it on 2h before showering everytime it’ll fade quickly
2380 2018-10-04 18:53:35 Been using it at night and the Rosehip oil during the day for 2months. My skin is thanking me!
2381 2018-10-04 18:53:12 @oil_castor انت الناجي الوحيد من هذه المعركة الطاحنة
2382 2018-10-04 18:53:05 I feel horrible for those poor oil companies.

So hard done by.
2383 2018-10-04 18:52:42 just cure your cancer with lavender essential oil and stop dying lmao
2384 2018-10-04 18:52:39 WHY WOULD HE DO THAT JUST GIVE THE CAR THE TREATMENT AND NICE OIL IT DESERVES

2386 2018-10-04 18:52:34 Wherever you are, whatever you do, just remember...........when you fry something in oil, it will pop you in the face no matter how far away from it you are.
2387 2018-10-04 18:52:33 it was long overdue but I finally went and got my oil changed. big girl hours
2388 2018-10-04 18:52:28 Nothing wakes you up faster than coconut oil exploding in a stove top pan and sending globs of boiling oil in every direction across the kitchen. 
2389 2018-10-04 18:52:27 $AMRN if markets were not in deep red, see you at $30! For those who could not tell the differences between DHA vs EPA, or Fish oil vs EPA, good luck shorting!

2397 2018-10-04 18:51:41 It looks like you are four year old.. prior to 2014 the international prices were almost double comparing to present prices..
We have achieved tremendous achievement in producing bhakt rather than producing oil.
We are dependent on oil import only.
Baat samaj aayi.
2398 2018-10-04 18:51:39 You know you have no life when you put on makeup just to go get an oil change
2399 2018-10-04 18:51:30 Listen up, the ingredients for the appetizer round are: 
 
 A binder of CDs, 
 Gravy, 
 Sesame oil, 
 and strawberries 
 
 Time starts now.
2400 2018-10-04 18:51:23 Pills and oils. doTerra and the other pilots guys will have a "canabanoid" oil in 6 months
2401 2018-10-04 18:51:21 I love that they play Texas country here where I get my oil change 
2402 2018-10-04 18:51:20 Mix some coconut oil in with something and eat it. Sounds gross, but works for me all the time 
2403 2018-10-04 18:51:18 Anyway I need more peppermint capsules. The hard shelled peppermint oil capsules saved me a few years ago. Didn’t have one IBS related symptom whole time
2404 2018-10-04 18:51:12 Led by Shell, Petro Canada and Esso! Goes up immediately when oil goes up ($5/gallon) but weeks to drop after oil and gas drop on markets! Total greed still!
2405 2018-10-04 18:51:10 Epic chiropractic crack compilations, dean martin roasts, late ‘80s hip hop videos, Giuseppe di Stefano being interviewed about what kind of olive oil he prefers on his spumoni
2406 2018-10-04 18:51:08 "Oil Price hits $86"

 Putin blames 
Trump
2407 2018-10-04 18:51:06 We need to know ,all generations why there are wars.Many times greed for land and OIL. We dont know how we are mislead.
Parents,grandparents should talk about the suffering war brings.Look at Syria, Yemen,Gaza .It is there if people would stop putting their heads in the sand.

2409 2018-10-04 18:50:47 ya leaf just splurged on oil paints and canvases and an easel purely bc i want to follow a bob ross tutorial
2410 2018-10-04 18:50:46 @JennyMcCarthy how long has E been on CBD oil? I have a parent interested in it.
2411 2018-10-04 18:50:39 "I wonder if they make beer-flavored baby oil"
2412 2018-10-04 18:50:28 First it was lead us, then it was be friends, then it was 15 by debt, then we won’t trade with you, then it was you won’t be in the EU, and now it’s ‘Shetland will go Indy too taking all the oil.’  So desperate and predictable
2413 2018-10-04 18:50:21 For the first time in my adult life I’m not relying on my dad to get my oil changed in my car. 
2414 2018-10-04 18:50:19 Oil price never bothers me. What bothers is  lack of infrastructure, Which congress never could provide nor ever tried.
2415 2018-10-04 18:50:16 U.S. oil benchmark loses nearly 3% to fall back below $75 a barrel
2416 2018-10-04 18:50:15 his boundaries re the oil deposits lay beyond the 16th parallel
2417 2018-10-04 18:50:06 Did you know Thyme essential oil is more effective at killing germs better and longer than chlorine bleach

2418 2018-10-04 18:49:56 Asparagus with s+p and olive oil; peppers/onions and (mushrooms or eggplant and/or zucchini) 350-400. About 8 minutes for asparagus; half hour for the other?
2419 2018-10-04 18:49:49 NICK REALLY JUST PUT THE WRONG FUCKING OIL IN MY CAR SO HE COULD SAVE A FEW DOLLARS. I WILL KILL HIM. THAT IS A NICE ASS LEXUS AND HE IS DESTROYINNGGGGGG IT. I’m livid.
2420 2018-10-04 18:49:46 EXACTLY! I didn't ONLY MOVE money from a bank 2 a credit union b/c of oil investments(though it was a motivator 2 do it as soon as possible). it was also 2 PROTECT MYSELF from rolled back customer protections from PREDATORY BANKS! BANKS can't gamble with money THEY DON'T HAVE
2421 2018-10-04 18:49:46 Nothing like a fresh oil change
2422 2018-10-04 18:49:44 Oil sector reforms can't be a one way process. Govt made bounty of more than Rs 7.5 trillion in four years through taxes. Now there should'nt any problem in giving relief to people when prices are nearing Rs 100/litre. High fuel prices also hurt demand and savings.
#PetrolPrice
2423 2018-10-04 18:49:40 I gotta get more oil for my pen before I dip 
2424 2018-10-04 18:49:28 Doesn't it depend on what is ultimately causing your inflation in the real world. Not all countries as resource rich as USA. Eg India was burning thru usd reserves at high oil prices. Started to recover once oil prices dipped. Long term need to be anti fragile to oil imports!
2425 2018-10-04 18:49:27 That's Juan Cole's tale, and I am sitting on mine. Trump is trying to get them produce oil more to lower US gas prices. Hey, I am all for that.
2426 2018-10-04 18:49:17 ??? 길드석이 깨지기도 하나여?

2429 2018-10-04 18:49:01 Then push the North Dakota oil fields to produce and provide jobs!
2430 2018-10-04 18:48:49 The pinned tweet on that account literally mentions coconut oil and don’t do that
2431 2018-10-04 18:48:45 Yes, it is huge oil imports only. #BloombergTV analysts saying same things. Grow up or just shut up!
2432 2018-10-04 18:48:40 Yes if U need to win 2019 u need to remove some VERY BIG DIRT, STONES, from the way to 2019 ROAD. currency going BAD 2 WORST SAME IN CASE OF CRUDE OIL FM SHOULD RESIGN IMMEDIATE

2434 2018-10-04 18:48:28 Out of this 2.5 Rs
1 Rs is sacrificed by oil companies such as HPCL, BPCL

0.23 Rs was raised on 4th oct itself. Its of no use

Remaining 1.27 Rs is net benefit to citizens received from govt.

You all are liars.
Its not the right time to fool indians.
2435 2018-10-04 18:48:24 Oil change  Transmission fluid  Car wash  I wanted to yolo this week and start another tattoo, but it’s ok Phoebe, take my money

2438 2018-10-04 18:48:10 The cool thing about living is Souther CA is, I can ride year round. The down side is when it dose rain the dumb fucks in cars are more dangerous than oil slicks.
2439 2018-10-04 18:48:09 U are right...But how...No factor is favorable specially crude oil...Governance problem...Aircraft quality, audit issues...What was ur basis...If u can share for learning purpose..
2440 2018-10-04 18:48:02 All I know is it cleared his acne like nobody's business to use real soap instead of fucking coconut oil.
2441 2018-10-04 18:47:59 Forehead gang 
2442 2018-10-04 18:47:57 I just don't understand things. Snake oil salesman? 

Trump is a lying con man.  That's not even disputable.  His "Trump University" was a scam that closed down and had to pay millions to settle the fraud lawsuits.
2443 2018-10-04 18:47:55 This hot oil treatment wayyyy over due !
2444 2018-10-04 18:47:50 Sir

2446 2018-10-04 18:47:38 Motor oil
2447 2018-10-04 18:47:26 Do you guys have one in St. Louis, MO? That would be my pick because then my family and I could visit! Btw do you guys use soybean oil, soy protein etc in any of your food? I ask because that’s what I’m allergic to. 
2448 2018-10-04 18:47:26 The Kingdom of #SaudiArabia has the triple role of, defending  Islam's two holy Cities,the Oil and Gas resources and the Air,Sea routes of the Arabian peninsula. The current Crown Prince and heir @MbSofKSA, M.B.S. is building a 'bridge' for his country to the East and West.
2449 2018-10-04 18:47:25 I hear there’s good wine & olive oil down there
2450 2018-10-04 18:47:12 The repeal of Roe will result in more deaths. The GOP knows this, but the evangelicals selling snake oil and mobilizing voters weigh more to them than a sudden spike of women dying from septicemia or blood loss during an unsafe abortion.
2451 2018-10-04 18:47:12 Brussels sprouts, potatoes, cauliflower, carrots. Toss in olive oil, salt, and pepper (maybe garlic if you like), spread on sheet pan, bake at 400-450 stirring occasionally until toasty brown and done.
2452 2018-10-04 18:46:59 WAM OIL Vendor day at Greenworks! Come on in to meet the Famous Rick the Ricker! These guys have some of the best CBD carts on the market!
2453 2018-10-04 18:46:52 My analysis: Krugman @paulkrugman bases his economic predictions on his personal bias and hatred toward people he doesn't agreed with. In short he is snake oil salesman and a scam artist.
2454 2018-10-04 18:46:45 Sooo why don’t you pledge to compensate the oil industry for their losses due to their heavily discounted oil because Trudeau/Sohl can’t get the pipeline built
2455 2018-10-04 18:46:38 That is the whole point,Energy East cancelled,Northern Gateway cancelled,government buys Trans Mountain to ensure it doesn’t get built,oilsands oil gets locked in just like Butts promised years ago.
2456 2018-10-04 18:46:29 It’s funny though because in my experience there’s some legitimacy of threat but also a lot of “data science” is snake oil, and actuaries are domain experts.
2457 2018-10-04 18:46:29 Sell Crude Oil on short covering with a $1 barrel rally. Selling-off with the stock market. Also look to buy the Dec. Yen at 87.85, Also if  long SPXS 3x Bear fund-stay long and add on to position. Dangerous times ahead if Trade War persists. #Commodities #Forex #Indexes #Panic
2458 2018-10-04 18:46:26 Why do people celebrate high oil prices?
2459 2018-10-04 18:46:18 Might mention Oil too - makes me laugh though that they are down just 40-50 handles off ATH - this mindless notion that it only goes up cant end well but yes he has person to blame ...
2460 2018-10-04 18:46:10 Thabs take a trip to Lagos these guys don’t play - the way they spend on Victoria Island will blow ur mind...
Even in Dubai - I guess the fact that it’s a rich oil country contributes and with a population of over 100 million it plays a part am sure....
2461 2018-10-04 18:46:02 also vitamin E oil to moisturize cus it also gets rid of scars/redness
2462 2018-10-04 18:45:54 organic supply & co. di instagram. pricey sih tapi otentik dan oil murni
2463 2018-10-04 18:45:47 im watching trisha paytas in walmarts auto center waiting for my cars oil to be changed, love this for me
2464 2018-10-04 18:45:35 眉毛にやっちゃう
2465 2018-10-04 18:45:33 You’re more beautiful than an oil painting Miki.. you’re a very sexy girl 
2466 2018-10-04 18:45:29 How much oil companies were asked from their kitty under Cong era?
2467 2018-10-04 18:45:18 Doing the blame game... oil price now high and they won’t say anything
2468 2018-10-04 18:45:16 Ahhh, 8 straight wins for the Gunners! Feels fantastic. And all without a Russian Oil Oligarch writing us blank checks... What a concept. #arsenal #COYG #EuropaLeague #baldyandtheoilyboys #we'recomingforyou
2469 2018-10-04 18:45:12 ISO someone to open my oil thing for me bc its too tight and i can’t do it and my mans just got to the airport so now idk who will do it for me ok thank!!
2470 2018-10-04 18:45:11 Yup america is draining every other country for oil then who gets the money for what's left.
2471 2018-10-04 18:44:59 I am waiting mr @farhanakhtr no tweets now on oil prices?#FuelPriceCut
2472 2018-10-04 18:44:55 Older white ladies always roll up somewhere and act exhausted because of a minor inconvience or errand I don’t get it. This woman’s just getting an oil change and she’s like freaking out and at my work people act so stressed to order a damn cheese pizza. Breathe girly you’re fine
2473 2018-10-04 18:44:48 I’ve been roasting a ton of vegetables of late. Olive oil, salt pepper, high heat. Sometimes I process fresh garlic and herbs into the oil first. Often find cast iron, cut side down, and ~15-20 minutes at 375-400 does everything from zucchini to fingerlings to Brussels sprouts.
2474 2018-10-04 18:44:47 That looks like an oil painting. God is an artist!
2475 2018-10-04 18:44:32 root veg! in butter with whole garlic cloves and hard herbs like rosemary. So, turnips, carrots, etc, chopped, tossed in oil and butter (or bacon fat), plenty of salt, stir a few times until soft. I like loads of pepper too, but add it later so it doesn't burn
2476 2018-10-04 18:44:30 Interent on 1.5 lakh cr oil bond for past 4.5 years how much?
2477 2018-10-04 18:44:30 AIM needs stricter regulation so MMs can't get away with murder lol
2478 2018-10-04 18:44:12 I don't think so. Saudi wants to crush the Houthis because of ports and access to the Bab-el-Mandeb straight. It's about selling oil to China (Maritime Silk Road). The Houthis being an Iranian proxy is way overblown (only limited support) I think this is a solo Saudi project
2479 2018-10-04 18:44:04 I use thr @missenvyb CBD oil to help me and its been nothing but good for me
2480 2018-10-04 18:43:39 coconut oil :)
2481 2018-10-04 18:43:39 @MontpellierBG I'd love to visit but am severely allergic to fish. Food can't be cooked in same oil/grill as fish. What can I eat here?
2482 2018-10-04 18:43:35 Grate papaya(green) or carrot than add salt,chili powder and lil bit of oil
2483 2018-10-04 18:43:33 I came to the dealership to get an oil change, lady talking bout “do you want us to rotate your tires too, for an additional $25?” I SAID I CAME IN HERE FOR AN OIL CHANGE!

2485 2018-10-04 18:43:25 U should Tweet some keto snack ideas. I’m eating straight tablespoons of almond butter and coconut oil.
2486 2018-10-04 18:43:12 Most important is to freeze the oil prices at some level else whatever reduction you announce shall be undone in a few weeks. The best course would be to ask oil companies to absorb future fluctuations at least for next three months.
2487 2018-10-04 18:42:58 Never thought of the implications for EVs with $100/brl oil. This is a great article!
2488 2018-10-04 18:42:53 When Cong asked OMC to absorb taxes n issued oil bonds in lieu of basic price it was great economic move for Lutyen media... hey na @aroonpurie ? @narendramodi @arunjaitley @dpradhanbjp @mihirssharma @waglenikhil

2491 2018-10-04 18:42:33 Unfortunately they don’t.  I come from that area and right now and for the past two years they have been out for her blood due to her stances on oil production and the problems in the Bakken.
Her opponent is dangerous.  Mentality is similar to 45
2492 2018-10-04 18:42:27 I mean, if they do gain independence they have to make up for all that missing space somehow. Not to mention all those oil and gas fields they can lay claim to.
2493 2018-10-04 18:42:26 Agriculture will never be as commercially viable to the TT economy as oil and gas because the country simply does not have the land space to be a major global player in the field, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said at the launch of the Alutech Research Facility. @Newsday_TT

2501 2018-10-04 18:41:29 Of course. But the reasoning of the fund so far has been restricted to cutting Norway’s oil exposure as a whole. So it’s interesting that they would start talking about returns. A Norwegian economist (who actually agrees with the proposal) called it a «populist» argument

2513 2018-10-04 18:40:19 I respectfully disagree & you are giving ammunition to the Democrats that say that we all are all comrades for Putin because he helped us defeat Hillary Clinton. The Middle East is certainly in America’s national interest with their bountiful oil reserves. Putin is our adversary.

2525 2018-10-04 18:39:19 @JosefSchachter What then is a more powerful determinant of oil price - fundamentals, or sentiment? Fact or hype? Are customers actually stopping buying Iran oil and is that a real supply crimp or a perceived crimp?
2526 2018-10-04 18:39:14 The increase was by independent oil company pricing policy but the reduction is due to you both!!

2536 2018-10-04 18:38:24 Super data dependant to hike into an oil price shock
2537 2018-10-04 18:38:24 Do you seriously believe that there are common people in India? Stop this practice of earning through oil excise or it’ll cost you dearly in 2019! There are other ways of earning apart from this. #PetrolDieselPriceHike #commonman #ExciseDutyCut

2555 2018-10-04 18:36:16 Using the term 'snake oil' is a bit rich when one of the reasons leave won was because of the people chosen to front remain,Clegg,Major and of course the toxic Blair had to stick his nose in,and after the vote a total nonentity Miller,how many people had heard of her  before ?
2556 2018-10-04 18:36:08 Bumped into my favorite kid from work while getting an oil change today and he ran up to me and gave me a hug caught me off guard but absolutely made my day

It's too much

2586 2018-10-04 18:34:19 Awesome decision to reverse earlier decision to deregulated oil & gas pricing as per market with government intervention in line with electorate expectations.

2589 2018-10-04 18:34:09 For yours kind knowledge I let remember that the barrel rate of crude oil is $90 petrol rate should be less than rupees 50 per litre said by none other than our current finance minister @arunjaitley. Does the rate of petrol is under rupees 50 per litre while the barrel is 80$.

2612 2018-10-04 18:32:17 So whilst I agree with original tweet (non fossil fuel being requirement of A rating) the devil here is in the detail; because fundamentally a 1kW oil filled rad is not easily compared to a 10kW ASHP or a 22kW condensing boiler - they are very different devices.

2619 2018-10-04 18:31:30 The CS/Citizen TV claims that  Water is a natural resource and cannot be sold.  Maybe they should  tell us whether Crude oil is a man made resource.
2620 2018-10-04 18:31:23 Yes mama yes this what I was dreaming about! U and that big ass! Wish u had some oil laying around
2621 2018-10-04 18:31:12 I don’t disagree. Doesn’t make your original statement correct. Methane release is now happening in waters throughout the Arctic in places where there is no drilling or oil activities. This is a problem that needs a solution and that is it

2626 2018-10-04 18:30:41 LIC is an extremely long term investor. Also, being an insurance company, it has growing and predictable cash flows. Hence, buying our oil companies is no burden for LIC. Yes, outright scams and subverting of national interests by Congress, for years, is a joke on citizens..
2627 2018-10-04 18:30:39 The oil man 
2628 2018-10-04 18:30:35 The best way is to call your council and arrange for it to be picked up and disposed of. I haven't had to do it with cooking oil myself but I've had other stuff which needed proper disposal. It wasn't expensive.
2629 2018-10-04 18:30:32 Are any of those alpha male types Brad Pitt themselves? What about
George Clooney? Matt Damon? Keith Urban?
Tom Cruise? No! They're 
closer to James Woods and he's no oil painting!!

2632 2018-10-04 18:30:06 Shame on you for making a fool of public earning billions by daily price revision that benefitted noone but oil companies & yourself. Paved way for 2000cr donation for sardar Patel statue.
Shame on you for looting billions by it & raising by 20rs and dropping 5. Save the dealers.
2633 2018-10-04 18:30:04 "And those women — I guess I'm good at this podium, and as varied as the people of Indiana cannot continue to create a sixth branch of the United States stands ready to export our abundant, affordable supply of oil, clean coal, and it’s happening fast."
2634 2018-10-04 18:30:01 meeting between group of 3 most important individuals of oil industry is about conclude(fingers crossed) and sources are hinting  that brent will hit $90 mark sooner then expected  #OOTT #
2635 2018-10-04 18:29:49 we pick our favorite oil and jump up on the counter and bake
2636 2018-10-04 18:29:48 I missed that smell of oil and gas 
2637 2018-10-04 18:29:33 Have you tried coconut oil?? I use that and haven’t had one issue!
2638 2018-10-04 18:29:19 When the appocolipse comes and money/oil is worth nothing and empty Gü cheesecake pots become a global currency, I will be having the last laugh
2639 2018-10-04 18:29:17 DO the folks in North Dakota realize a Dem controlled Senate will do everything they can to eliminate oil production in the US, especially that coming from fracking
2640 2018-10-04 18:29:00 Asif McLaren and Renault are still waiting for their Oil for the Grand Prix 
2641 2018-10-04 18:28:58 Let's also not forget Kharg Island, the source of a significant majority of Iran's oil production and refining, which is.... In an island in the middle of the Persian Gulf with no land connections to Iran.
2642 2018-10-04 18:28:56 Whaaaaa??? I've seen him/her/it on YouTube. He wants you to pooo yourself to death in two months from a diet of banana and castor oil, so you don't ask any more questions! If I tried smiling like him it would hurt -  maybe he has supernatural facial muscles?
2643 2018-10-04 18:28:54 
2644 2018-10-04 18:28:35 My car shut down as I pulled into the wawa and a complete stranger pushed me to the gas pump and checked my oil and all. We need more men like this!!!! Sooo grateful for nice strangers

2648 2018-10-04 18:28:03 It's worse than castor oil
2649 2018-10-04 18:28:02 If civets picked the best berries, as is claimed, then deposited them in a nice clean basket using their imaginary opposable digits I’d be up for it. Otherwise no. Argan oil, which I think is trendy,  used to be extracted from argan nuts retrieved from goat poop. Nope!
2650 2018-10-04 18:27:56 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2651 2018-10-04 18:27:56 He got $850k from Blavatnik (Mitch about $2.5 and Rubio, Ryan etc got some) but since Blavatnik has dual citizenship even tho he's from the oil oligarch family he has enough money in his own right to make the PAC contribution legit if shady.
2652 2018-10-04 18:27:53 let me go get this oil changed
2653 2018-10-04 18:27:52 water is our oil turkana county was paid 25% narok gets 100% from maasai Mara why not  Muranga county reap from ndakaini dam else cut supply
2654 2018-10-04 18:27:46 They both have light eyes, same nose and a oil and they’re wearing fenty 280 I know it’s not a perfect match but don’t huh me
2655 2018-10-04 18:27:44 Cs Chelugui is out of order. He enjoys Murang'a water with also the green grass and swimming pool at his home. Even your county receives a cut from Keiyo valley flourspar. If water is a national resource oil is a Turkana resource you mean @MwangiWaIria @YvonneOkwara

2664 2018-10-04 18:27:07 this is the blow-back moment because of modest national progress on climate (before Trump). the oil and gas industry is behind a lot of this right-wing corruption. we have to defeat them or make an end run around them or both by having states lead etc.
2665 2018-10-04 18:27:03 I am a Dr. in political science, I know my history. Russia is too dangerous to tackle. Iran on the other hand, with its vast resources, gas, oil, minerals is easy prey.

2667 2018-10-04 18:26:52 Oil price keep increasing but no corresponding improvement in Nigeria's economy. Hmmmm, what's actually happening.
2668 2018-10-04 18:26:47 Ladies, please make sure you do know when to change your car oil..

This lady is stranded here in traffic and cant even figure her problem.
2669 2018-10-04 18:26:46 Yeah, it's like there's a frequent misunderstanding of how mutable the physical world is by all the folks who have half-submerged their brain stem in VR oil.
2670 2018-10-04 18:26:31 Please listen to it carefully. Whenever price of petrol used to rise for 50 paise BJP PPL demonstrated rolling on roads with big banners. It was never so high even when crude oil in international market used to be 150 dollars per barrel.
2671 2018-10-04 18:26:22 I am asking u the same. Was BJP's approach as an opposition prior to 2014 balanced or opportunistic? When oil price was hovering around USD 120/barrel, they were doing this drama on streets, what for? Wasn't the nation first at tat time? Didn't they know it's bad for economy?
2672 2018-10-04 18:26:19 What's the best way to dispose of large amounts of cooking oil?
2673 2018-10-04 18:26:09 Remember to change your oil.
2674 2018-10-04 18:26:09 Lady De, Schumer is nothing more than a snake oil salesman. These folks have been in office to long they got to go.
2675 2018-10-04 18:26:08 If population was stable, yes I agree. I also agree that many industries are over exploiting the environment, especially infrastructure. 
Palm Oil, HS2, Fracking, even mass extinctions are linked to markets & commoditisation of labour. Reduction in population blitzes demand.
2676 2018-10-04 18:26:07 Basa ka muna ng world news. Baka malula ka sa presyo ng Oil dito sa Norway na TOP Oil producer. Susko na pag iiwanan tlga.
2677 2018-10-04 18:25:58 One night I made basic ground beef for tacos, and decided to lightly dip the corn tortillas in oil to soften them up. I accidentally left one in too long and it ended up turning in an almost-crispy shell but I stopped it in time. It was AWESOME. Not wimpy, but pliable. Try it!
2678 2018-10-04 18:25:56 my shits been fractionally distilled   with this chicken grease crude oil. its a worthy sacrifice. thank u for ur concern brother

2683 2018-10-04 18:25:32 The price of oil suddenly increased after the transaction and they had to pay more no one would have estimated the OPEC decision to increase prices. Hard truth n fact.
2684 2018-10-04 18:25:26 Democrats were very cozy with Russia during Obama years. Russia would prefer Democrats. Everything Obama gave them and let them get away with. Not even a single complaint when the EU let Russia pump oil into the EU pipeline, hypocrisy
2685 2018-10-04 18:25:26 Let Nairobi County pay the proposed 25% to Múrang'a County for getting the Ndakaini  water services. Its only fair just like Narok gets returns from Maasai Mara parks or Turkana from oil. The 25% be used to provide water to Múrang'a residents @citizentvkenya
2686 2018-10-04 18:25:04 For the hair I used an Oil brush for the base to get the tone and shading correct(ish) then the Hair brushes which are brilliant if you soft airbrush erase the end points.
2687 2018-10-04 18:24:59 Crude oil is an imported commodity. When its import becomes costlier, its use must be discouraged for encouraging  other alternatives by keeping its price inflated. 

We must not opt such steps that may unbalance our correct level of inflation essential for economy at present.
2688 2018-10-04 18:24:57 The government may not be interested in the fuel tax escalator but their pursuit of #Brexit has devalued the pound enough to effect diesel & petrol prices. With oil heading for $100 driver's might soon learn to drive efficiently, walk or cycle.
2689 2018-10-04 18:24:48 I sell organic oil for skin/ hair care nd black soap made from natural ingredients suitable for all skin types very affordable.

Not bad for 5 hrs work.
2695 2018-10-04 18:24:39 See don't mind this ppl, they're trying to bury what has bn uncovered, instead of them to keep quiet ,they're trying to portray their foolishness with illogical analysis.
Ok they don't know anything, why were they protesting???

2700 2018-10-04 18:24:01 MB is already one of the greenest provinces with hydro and solar initiatives. The big emission producers mining, construction, oil, lumber were getting a handout with the pricing model, while every mb citizen was forced to pay. It's a tax grab.
2701 2018-10-04 18:23:59 If Twitter hd charged us Rs1 fr every tweet tht was made against Modi/bjp, in last few months, It might hv made more money than(you are guessing the Oil companies who made fortune by increased oil prices or the runaway brides with bank loans)his advertisement cost!Long way to go!
2702 2018-10-04 18:23:52 eat whatever whole foods you want. ie leave out the oil, sugar, refined flour, white rice etc....
2703 2018-10-04 18:23:46 Maybe issue oil bonds for the next govt to pay??? Either ways the common man has to pay for what he consumes today or his grandchildren day after tomorrow along with huge interest. What do you prefer? My guess older people prefer to defer ;-)  ...

2718 2018-10-04 18:22:08 Slightly disappointed that my #Airbnb guests haven't purchased/left behind any extra virgin olive oil lately. I mean how do they expect me to cook, that stuff is expensive!  #superhost #iraidmyfridge

Just look at Theranos
2733 2018-10-04 18:21:10 Ah TT, I am so grateful I can have these months away every year. I'd love to do it all the time, though, but I know I can count myself very lucky. Just wish the barges would maintain themselves though...haha. I spend the rest of the year wallowing in paint and oil

2737 2018-10-04 18:20:55 got my first half of the months bills paid & got my oil changed. today’s a good day
2738 2018-10-04 18:20:54 Can Kingdom afford low oil prices by increasing production. Remember they have to pay for the bombs used to kill Yemeni children and also fund ISIS and similar terrorist organisations.
2739 2018-10-04 18:20:51 They’ve been digging deeper than for oil wells into Trump-Russia collusion and after two years, zilch. The FBI dug to get proof into Ford’s allegations and also zilch. You would think that by now they would accept HRCs loss.
2740 2018-10-04 18:20:49 Try cannabis oil.  It works.

2744 2018-10-04 18:20:28 I use oil & it works but only in large amounts (for me, but I have chronic full body pain so it probably depends on your situation) so if u have to use as much as I do, it gets very, very expensive
2745 2018-10-04 18:20:24 lol yessssss, but i think i'm just gonna go chug an essential oil and pray for the best. ;)
2746 2018-10-04 18:20:22 Heh. Idgi. Why use such filters? Were they going for the oil portrait look?
2747 2018-10-04 18:20:14 if this was a State-approved "enemy", War drums would be pounding ,in favor of "Humanitarian bombing". Media( including your network) would be in full Outrage Mode. But its the Saudis, so: meh.
Unless they started selling their oil in Euros.
Then we'd invade withing 24 hours
2748 2018-10-04 18:20:14 Hahahahahahah, oh wait, are you being serious? If you believe, I’ve got some snake oil to sell you, as well.
2749 2018-10-04 18:20:05 Topically coconut oil is undefeated
2750 2018-10-04 18:19:58 They can also vote by majority if they really want. Fact is india is now an oil tax economy and if bought under gst then biggest looser wuld be centre cuz states still have option of additional tax on gst. Nobody wants to loose the golden goose hence the reluctance.
2751 2018-10-04 18:19:50 I havent seen no fucking pin head in the oil field say “lets geter done”
2752 2018-10-04 18:19:41 you need a good setting spray, oil free products and a lot of powders to stay matte. but you can always touch up your makeup
2753 2018-10-04 18:19:28 Where can a regular joe learn more about the LNG tax breaks? I hope BC will benefit from the project similiar to how Norway benefits from oil contracts. Surely we will get more than jobs from the project?
2754 2018-10-04 18:19:16 Memories, memories, memories.....all bad by the way. My Austin Allegro required new ball joints as regularly as an oil top up...but on the plus side...the water leaks in the boot provided a perfect environment for growing huge mushrooms. Halcyon days....NOT !!!

2756 2018-10-04 18:19:11 In a way it’s pretty obvious that returns would have benefited from a divestment before the oil crash. The point we’re making is more about how the oil fund is fleshing out its arguments in what’s turning out to be one of the most important domestic debates in Norway
2757 2018-10-04 18:19:08 Yes--food oil to be made in same facility as far as I understand. Already exporting sugar and Iraq now mostly self sufficient in white sugar.
2758 2018-10-04 18:19:01 If you have a Costco around they have "Season" brand which is pretty good.  

I'm fine with sardines in mustard sauce but packed in olive oil is my go to.
2759 2018-10-04 18:18:59 @jiffylube Hey, if I buy a Groupon for an oil change, should I also be charged by the Jiffy location?
2760 2018-10-04 18:18:58 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
2761 2018-10-04 18:18:52 Crude oil Jun19 95 Calls trade 100 times
2762 2018-10-04 18:18:52 Thanks Boss. Olive oil I’ll give it a go
2763 2018-10-04 18:18:49 What if we cut lose with petrodollars and start trading oil in Renminbi or euro ? Would clearly strengthen the saudi currency and hit the dollar hard...
2764 2018-10-04 18:18:27 Well I just imagine like a lake, with oil on top that’s lit on fire and it’s like almost on my skin so I’m almost on fire so I can either save myself from burning and drown, or I can save myself from drowning and burn. That’s how I see it.
2765 2018-10-04 18:18:23 Lmao see your brows like you put oil to draw it
2766 2018-10-04 18:18:19 i dreamt i drove somewhere really far and my car exploded because i need an oil change
2767 2018-10-04 18:18:16 طيب بتنفخوني بمنفاخ ولا ابر
2768 2018-10-04 18:18:11 Similarly, shale oil development is about economies of scale, so they trade at non-negative values in spite of negative current CF b/c investors assume each player will either be among few winners or be gobbled up by a winner.
2769 2018-10-04 18:18:04 If this is true everyone better clean and oil. Being prepared is half the battle. #KickOutSoros #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #WalkAwayFromDemocrats2018 #LiberalsAreViolent #LiberalsLie
2770 2018-10-04 18:18:02 I Must have a rummage in mine one day, must be all sorts up there, But no oil paintings of any value! 
2771 2018-10-04 18:17:58 Coconut oil is the best.
2772 2018-10-04 18:17:48 Fallacious thinking. Wages are set by supply/demand for given task. Over time, govt income like basic income or oil dividend might lower wage demands, but effect is dwarfed by overall supply/demand for labor at issue. That =/= budiness “subsidy.”
2773 2018-10-04 18:17:47 Tea tree oil is good for soothing and getting rid of mosquito bites. Or you can use peppermint oil if the tea tree oil scent is too herbal for you.
2774 2018-10-04 18:17:46 Because u got the benefit when it was at $100+ for almost 2 yrs when congress subsidised the fuel for u by building up oil subsidies bill.. but gyaanis like u considered that pricing as bench mark n measuring nda tenure pricing wrt to it.. that's where the basic flaw is
2775 2018-10-04 18:17:46 Just get this feeling nifty 4 digits seems real by nextweek. 
Crude oil and Dollar both double whammy.  Whether d government acts or doesn't economy stands to loose.

2780 2018-10-04 18:17:23 Hello, if you don’t mind shooting out to Transit I usually go to the Kwik Lube at Basil bc they don’t even take appointments, price is nice and they give you a free car wash with every oil change.

2807 2018-10-04 18:15:13 So are the Saudis' but as they have the oil they are freely ignored while they fund hard line Wahhabi & Salafist groups and blow up busses full of school kids with our bombs which we sell them and starve hundreds of thousands to death with their blockades which we aid in.

2828 2018-10-04 18:13:31 I can recommend magnesium oil, works a treat. If you apply it just after training, it might lessen the pain. So advise would be to take more magnesium in general, afaik related to muscles

2838 2018-10-04 18:12:37 To reduce (still increasing) fossil fuel USE by 90% by 2050, we need to eliminate 1 mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) PER DAY, EVERY DAY until 2050. Thats 1 nuclear reactor A DAY, or 14 million 300W PV solar panels A DAY! It's not going to happen...

2851 2018-10-04 18:11:25 Drying is a good choice. Currently my favourite way is to make sauces, its easier to deal with (if you have a good mixer). Grinding is more hazardous, do it in the free air. Never tried oil.

I can send you some sauce recipes.

Or: Put it in the fridge and then on Pizza.
2852 2018-10-04 18:11:23 I prefer physical therapy from one with PhD who knows Yoga. Had one but she had $100K student debt to attain PhD. She lost everything in 2007. So no physical therapy for me after moving 300 gallons of vegi oil for my eco defender 83' MercBenz this week.

This is not getting reported on enough

2864 2018-10-04 18:10:15 And this is false. Up here in the Arctic we have lakes literally bubbling from the methane. You want to argue there would be no global warming without oil then maybe that is true but you can forget the whole industrial revolution and everything since then

2876 2018-10-04 18:09:35 After reduction of ₹2.50 on #Diesel and #Petrol by Central govt, many state govts. have further reduced the prices by ₹2.50 leading to total reduction of ₹5.

2898 2018-10-04 18:07:53 Here's the thing: if you got "it", you got it on a good day, bad day, when it's sunny, when it's stormy, when you're enthused, when you're depressed....
Some of us are just holding "it" THINKING we've got it.
Life will show you if you've really got oil, love, joy, friendships....
2899 2018-10-04 18:07:46 Am not saying all people wl get engaged in service exports but only 4% of population even if engages in it then they can bring much needed forex like oil & rest can get employed in less skilled areas in era of #AI. Like driving  skill not needed for in era of self driving car.

2902 2018-10-04 18:07:38 I own oil wells. I BARTY!
2903 2018-10-04 18:07:33 I somehow to expect I’d destroy both, my respiratory tract and also my kitchen when trying  to cook them up for some sauce. 
To dry and grind them is the easy solution... Spicy oil? Is botulism a real threat or does Jolokia kill the bacteria?
2904 2018-10-04 18:07:24 Lol I'm not a kid on here, I've bn here before you dreamt of owning a phone,and Jtown is not new to me, you'll be surprised I've stayed in Jos more than you.
And for commenting on issues you can dig my tweets.

2912 2018-10-04 18:06:18 This looks lovely. Cuttle and beans is a big favourite of ours. (Think oil rich Greek yiganthes with soft white ribbons of cuttle.)   And your book’s great Thom!
2913 2018-10-04 18:06:13 All political parties,’centre and state, should agree to bring petrol/diesel under GST if they really are concerned about consumer. When FM is forced to announce a price cut on behalf of oil marketing cos, you realise that fuel price deregulation is irrational.#FuelPriceCut
2914 2018-10-04 18:06:11 For what...? Slashing oil prices by 2.5 INR? Don’t know when will your conscience awaken? But wait... BJP leaders don’t have one...!!
2915 2018-10-04 18:06:01 Jay, the younger brothers, harvest some vegetables from their backyard, while Nathan, his older brothers, cooks them usually with whatever animals' eggs he scavenges without salt, condiments or oil. Humanity and their civilization has collapsed, so have the Walmart's #amwriting
2916 2018-10-04 18:06:01 Haha!!! I used to use my moms oil of Olay when I was little! I’d sneak it. Put a little on my face every day lol I’ve used anti aging products since I was young.  Let me know if you want some guidance to get you started! Xoxo

If olive oil is made from crushed olives and vegetable oil is made from crushed vegetables then what in hell is baby oil made from?
2918 2018-10-04 18:05:54 The data poor nature of this environment gives rise to all sorts of snake oil.
2919 2018-10-04 18:05:21 Oh great there goes another oil spill
2920 2018-10-04 18:04:56 รอค้าบบบ ยังมีหวังแม้จะน้อยนิดก็ตามที
2921 2018-10-04 18:04:55 375 down and I'm the poorest I've been since June! I hate cars! I'm hoping this oil leak that's killing every alternator installed is just something like the rocker/cam cover gasket and not something shit and threatening like the head gasket 
2922 2018-10-04 18:04:53 Stealing n putting where? hutiye 2007 me 1$ - 39.3 and now 73 .
So crude oil price is 3419 in 2007 vs 6351 (approx) now. Not everyone has low iq like your Rahul ghandy and you pidis!
2923 2018-10-04 18:04:49 You are aware that your band of hooligans has absolute power right now, right? You think you did great things. So, why the fear of the minority? Can't sell your snake oil to the people anymore, Dave?
2924 2018-10-04 18:04:47 okay you're onto something.  
Matt Parnassus is *actually*  an undercover boss, CEO-to-be of Parnassus Oil, but his dad thinks he needs to do some Honest Work to be able to run a company and crush his enemies. He meets Techie on the job.
2925 2018-10-04 18:04:42 Polished chain and changed oil to start the year off on the right foot 
2926 2018-10-04 18:04:35 Also wondering how a team not even in the NHL also took the Oil to OT?

2928 2018-10-04 18:04:09 Hi Pol. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.

2934 2018-10-04 18:03:44 Is there any guarantee that the oil companies won’t increase oil price from tomorrow onwards? Otherwise it will take only 3-4 days for them to recover this mere 1+1.50 !
2935 2018-10-04 18:03:40 We might be able to process oil but rum will always flow.
2936 2018-10-04 18:03:39 do you have coconut oil? it really helps + tastes good :/ or vaseline? honey? make a scrub with sugar and honey and leave it on, it might help? idk halibut is also good

2946 2018-10-04 18:02:49 should I get an oil diffuser or just stick to my candles?
2947 2018-10-04 18:02:46 Sir, When the global crude oil price will fall to 70 USD?
2948 2018-10-04 18:02:39 First @maddow is a national treasure.....Second, I think you are clearly a person(I am assuming?) with some patchouli oil induced rage and Third, possessing a weird need to justify language which is hardly filled with anything but the ravings of a Bernie Bro type ...

2955 2018-10-04 18:01:40 CBD pills I've only heard about CBD oil. I have been trying to find an oil for my fibromyalgia. My state legalized marijuana but the medical card and product are too expensive. I refuse opioids and there is no alternative. I have other conditions that make CBD or pot my only hope

2960 2018-10-04 18:01:20 Here in the mountains we lose power all the time during the winter, sometimes for multiple days. I have propane lanterns, kerosene oil lamps, flashlights, you name it! Life in the wilderness.

2968 2018-10-04 18:00:49 Hopefully the State of Jefferson will become a reality, and control the food and water to the rest of the state; southern CA has the oil.

People can get along for a while without oil, but everyone needs food and water. Shut off their supply, raise the prices, close the borders.
2969 2018-10-04 18:00:41 Someone convince me that Counselors aren’t just snake oil salesmen...
2970 2018-10-04 18:00:39 Politicians with plans to protect the environment are snake oil salesmen.  The only way to protect the environment is through innovation, increasing private property rights and liability to minimize the tragedy of the commons.

Politicians are a problem, not a solution.

2978 2018-10-04 17:59:57 I could see that blind acceptance of Trump's BS. We should be using less oil for the environment's sake and promoting renewables. Cutting taxes has done nothing except increase the debt. Border policies are unlawful. Like I said, blinders.
2979 2018-10-04 17:59:56 They just went for an ice cream cone and the investigation is done. The American people is being fried in their own oil.

2985 2018-10-04 17:59:14 Because Saudis told him to. Big weapons deal at Trumps visit. Didn’t put up a fuss over Qatar. They don’t want Iran’s oil to hit the market. Oil per barrel would drop. Oil companies don’t want that.
2986 2018-10-04 17:59:06 It is a real shame! Let the oil be found somewhere else abeg!

3009 2018-10-04 17:57:35 New models is one thing. What really counts is the number of actual cars available.
So the brand(s) which can deliver will dominate the market and will keep that market share going forward.
Higher oil prices will likely cause a further surge in demand for BEVs,

3016 2018-10-04 17:56:53 Energy sector need to be rationalised in the interest of National economy to save an immense of foreign currency on this account. Future of oil refineries need not be secured at the cost of foreign currency expense. End products of oil refineries need to be diverted to else ones.
3017 2018-10-04 17:56:52 Black Seed Oil. . . Hmmm 
3018 2018-10-04 17:56:48 Do you have any thoughts on how to motivate the oil and gas companies to clean them up faster? So many corner lots in our city have been sitting vacant for years in areas of prime real estate.

3023 2018-10-04 17:56:31 The gasoline companies are screwing northern Maine. Whatever happened to the surplus oil and gas derived from fracking and homeland oil drilling. Probably sold it to China for lead paint.
3024 2018-10-04 17:56:19 High oil prices (real price of oil is $84 (Brent, OPEC basket, Dubai, etc) not $74 (WTI) and a weakening economy is a Molotov cocktail for China.  Can't splurge on commodities for fiscal stimulus without raising input costs for manufacturing/construction.
3025 2018-10-04 17:56:19 Bet you didn't care when oil slick Willie stepped out on Hillary did you hypocrite
3026 2018-10-04 17:56:18 Infact I am confused one economist quote on TV total import of oil is 16 billion $ per annum , in case 2 billion import from saudia then rest of the 14 billions import from which countries ?
3027 2018-10-04 17:56:07 i thought it was just inflation and oil prices or something
3028 2018-10-04 17:56:03 Read a little bit more, crude oil is not vegetables where you see current day rate, pay that much and buy it. Those who run economy are much better than you and me. They hedge the future risks be it increasing USD rate or oil price.
3029 2018-10-04 17:55:52 With expected interest rate hike, servicing existing debt will be more difficult. Also thanks to weaking CAD and pressure on Rupee, External Commercial Borrowing will also make life difficult for India Inc. Challenging quarter or two ahead. Oil price also  needs to be factored.
3030 2018-10-04 17:55:51 I agree that plastic waste in water bodies is horrible and that we need more biodegradable packaging, etc. 
Canada not exporting oil WILL NOT speed up this process. We own the trans mountain pipeline so let's get TMX safely built and profitably sell it.

3034 2018-10-04 17:55:32 Fortunately my property tax is extremely low, way under new deduct limit. As I said before, maybe I see more positive impact from Trump due to location. Oil/gas booming, defense $ up, etc new trade deal already has my corp. looking toward increase production.

3042 2018-10-04 17:55:00 I just got a brand new cue and the wood is rather pale for my liking would linseed oil rectify this?
3043 2018-10-04 17:54:48 $CP run with oil sentiment as well?

3049 2018-10-04 17:53:53 I hate scrubs for my face definitely, it’s too abrasive. I use a coffee scrub with olive oil. This dry skin along with eczema , my scrub is the obly thing that keeps me from wanting to scratch my skin off
3050 2018-10-04 17:53:45 All this "winning" is getting exhausting.  There's goes that ridiculously nothing of a tax break so I can use that money to pay the oil company CEO's.
3051 2018-10-04 17:53:30 Exchange rate bhi bata de and what about oil bond
3052 2018-10-04 17:53:22 Iran is threatening to defy U.S. economic sanctions as the Trump administration targets the country’s oil supply by placing pressure on allies to cut all ties with Tehran.

3055 2018-10-04 17:53:03 Wow and what about the 1lac crore oil bonds debt issued
3056 2018-10-04 17:53:01 Since the day of the Brexit result ,there has been a lot less baggers. And maybe because we are a market of developing British companies that we will feel the pain first caused by uncertainties.

Some serious AIM regulation along with $150 oil and 2k PoG would help a lot too!

3058 2018-10-04 17:52:55 Beijing has extended a lifeline to the corrupt & incompetent Maduro regime in Venezuela, pledging $5 billion in questionable loans to be repaid with oil. China is also that country’s single largest creditor, saddling the Venezuelan people with more than $50 billion in debt.
3059 2018-10-04 17:52:52 @realDonaldTrump
@VP 
China and Russia already used North Korea for the president to cancel a meeting in South america, so they could buy time and get more from Venezuelan Oil They are taking advantage of the desperation of Maduro because he is a brute, capture Maduro disable him

3081 2018-10-04 17:49:50 Ma'am, it's too late n too little. Had you transferred the benefit of low prices of the crude oil to the people they wouldn't have been so anguished now. People expect low prices not world class infrastructure.

3087 2018-10-04 17:49:15 Please understand the dynamics of how pricing works first in India today (dynamic pricing) & before (decontrolling prices). Fuel subsidies now & before is nothing but giving public money to oil companies to reduce pricing.

3098 2018-10-04 17:48:19 It's really amazing that you can continue to "deny" big oil propaganda. 

In science, many times an object is not "seen" directly, but only by its effect. If you see a coastal community with flood-like damage...you can assume it was flooded.
3099 2018-10-04 17:48:18 Refineries can be reconfigured to process  different blends of oil. I would also like to think that Eastern Canadians would prefer using CDN oil to helping bankroll human rights abuses abroad.

3175 2018-10-04 17:41:56 Starts out as a spark plug, give it some gas and oil, ta-da baby car
3176 2018-10-04 17:41:40 Speaking of which... my light came on last week for an oil change. 
3177 2018-10-04 17:41:34 Ya q pasas por acá porque no explicas el acuerdo q cerraste con oil cinco días antes de irte de la gestión!!? Ambos #Caraduras y el intolerable de siempre de el ex mandatario sólo responde bloqueando!!!
3178 2018-10-04 17:41:31 In fairness I do know how to do oil and water IF I had to do it, I just haven’t. Tyres I’ve never ever done or been shown how.
3179 2018-10-04 17:41:13 Madam You should know economic scenarios before you take any policy decision. !. Would crude oil price, 2. Facial Deficit 3. Support from State govt in reducing state taxes, 4. Dollar Price .. I hope appko pata hoga ki Perol hum Ghar main nahi banate.....
3180 2018-10-04 17:41:08 Nor will we forget Trudeau and Freelands incompetence. It should never have come down to burning the midnight oil just before a deadline to get the deal done.
3181 2018-10-04 17:41:07 Why is an oil change this much
3182 2018-10-04 17:41:07 Oil trus natrep
3183 2018-10-04 17:41:05 อยู่ว
3184 2018-10-04 17:40:58 Why did you volunteer to be a mercenary for the oil companies? Repeatedly?
3185 2018-10-04 17:40:53 Mam Ka Caster will kick you so hard you will shit yourself kube as if your drank Castor oil.
3186 2018-10-04 17:40:52 "Find you some coconut oil and play with ya meat"
*Giggles lika fuck*
3187 2018-10-04 17:40:36 With virtually the entire market taking a dump today worth noting that Owens Corning $OC is green. Some recent positive commentary by Goldman which various people have posted on Twitter for those interested. Housing sector hated now. Kind of reminds me of the oil sector in 2017.
3188 2018-10-04 17:40:35 Get some knowledge of hw exports happen. There is a universal law in world tht any product/service exported shall not ne taxed. Secondly govt owned oil companies haven’t start export post May 2014. They were exporting pre May 2014 also. Can u provide at wat price was it exported?
3189 2018-10-04 17:40:35 Me: I’m working 6 days a week,10 hours a day,nights in Lansing.

Dad: good, make that money.

Mom: hshdgjjcfdhv do you need me to buy you a hotel? Do you need gas money? They should be paying for you to stay somewhere. Do you need an oil change!? Are you getting enough sleep?!!
3190 2018-10-04 17:40:35 Aw thank you for offering, but that's not necessary. They ended up reviewing it anyway (squeaky wheel gets the oil?) and obviously it's not inappropriate in any way and they put the ads back.
3191 2018-10-04 17:40:34 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
3192 2018-10-04 17:40:31 Paraffin or cooking oil
3193 2018-10-04 17:40:31 Coconut oil/ something similar or even cuticle oil if you have the. The blood curiculation will help strengthen. Also don’t use your nails as “tools” as much as you can help it!
3194 2018-10-04 17:40:16 Big plans. Hot action. Grand ambitions. Midnight oil. Or maybe just a nap.

Yes! A nap!
3195 2018-10-04 17:40:12 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
3196 2018-10-04 17:40:05 they didn’t put my oil cap back on and completely destroyed my engine and it takes an hour so i ain’t going back there
3197 2018-10-04 17:39:48 #ArabiaSaudita y #Rusia planean elevar producción en el corto plazo, por lo que los precios del #petróleo se encaminan su peor sesión en tres semanas. El #WTI cae 2.3% a 74.65 dólares por barril y el #Brent baja 1.6% a 84.94 dólares #OOTT #Oil #oilprices #Energy
3198 2018-10-04 17:39:47 No one said tgey were but it is of common and public knowkedge that the oil fields cannot be exploited because
3199 2018-10-04 17:39:46 Burn the midnight oil 

See you tomorrow evening!

#WeAreUnited
3200 2018-10-04 17:39:42 I think it's that 38 billion over 10 years OB did. 3.8B per year given trade value, security exchanges, tech co-op and dunking on Iran helping oil & gas export prices. Well might be an argument for return on investment. Not to say you aren't also correct but *shrug*
3201 2018-10-04 17:39:25 High oil prices benefit Putin.
3202 2018-10-04 17:39:19 Heavy brine or just packed in oil?
3203 2018-10-04 17:39:18 I wish they would just use fresh, good quality fryer oil instead 
3204 2018-10-04 17:39:17 Do I want to read Ida Tarbell's full "The History of the Standard Oil Company," or the condensed version, or a different book on Standard Oil? Someone help me out here.
3205 2018-10-04 17:39:08 D last time I know, malabu oil deal wasn't done during GEJ admin.
3206 2018-10-04 17:39:06 What’s that pitch made of, oil? Guys slipping all over the place
3207 2018-10-04 17:39:04 本研究でガウシアンノイズの的になるLENNAさんじゃん
3208 2018-10-04 17:38:56 Hope government will bite bullet and not get our fiscal situation out of control. Because oil prices are short term worry, while fiscal deficit is long term problem. Hope opposition parties raise their voices in long term  benefit of nation and for their political propaganda.
3209 2018-10-04 17:38:50 Avenatti should be disbarred. This creepy porn lawyer is lower than a snake, a fraud, a shyster, a snake oil salesman and a disgrace to his profession.
3210 2018-10-04 17:38:49 You cannot impose taxes but who is stopping from making a profit. We are not oil producing state. We get most of it as imports so why are we selling it to other nations without profit? Are we bound by some agreement to sell oil to others at cost price only?
3211 2018-10-04 17:38:39 Oil level control failed and filled this compressor to the tip with oil. Must have been a violent death... @ Union City, California
3212 2018-10-04 17:38:36 Heard that oil unlocks feelings
3213 2018-10-04 17:38:31 Well, the whole plan was to ride the wave of 'luck' Modi allegedly brought in the form of cheap crude oil. Prudence is too much to expect. They couldn't be transparent abt it bcoz they used petrol prices as an election issue n unsurprisingly are still using it.
3214 2018-10-04 17:38:29 Bold prediction, since due to its dependency on oil and gas sales the Iranian economy is heavily dependent on how other countries react to US sanctions. If they follow,the drop will be steeper,if they don’t,things won’t be as bad.Looks like a statistical average prediction to me.
3215 2018-10-04 17:38:22 Correct yourself, FM allowance reduction of excise duty which he control. Oil company do not decide tax rate and neither give rate. U must know this
3216 2018-10-04 17:38:17 And please see the rising crude oil prices and impact of it.
3217 2018-10-04 17:38:15 Yes true but there is no justification for US to keep bullying sovereign nations thru sanctions, whosoever crosses its 'national interests'; Russia annexed Crimea to save Russians living there; India buying S400 to safeguard its borders n buying oil from Iran to help its economy
3218 2018-10-04 17:38:06 Winning a primary elections is just like having an O’Level, but the main issue is scoring high marks in JAMB which is  general election.
The time to work hard is now. This is the beginning of burning a midnight oil like an hardworking candidate.
Congrats!
3219 2018-10-04 17:38:00 National Oil petrol station in Kakamega town near Equity Bank mixing super petrol with paraffin seriously...beware
3220 2018-10-04 17:37:46 this old ass receptionist tryna flirt like sir i’m just tryna get my oil changed...men disgust me
3221 2018-10-04 17:37:42 @dpradhanbjp sir and @arunjaitley sir it is important for u to tell the Indian people in a proper press conference about the oil bonds Modi govt is paying which was left by the previous gvt.More than half the population dont knw abt this bonds and its important for them to knw.
3222 2018-10-04 17:37:32 Thanks a million. That amazon warrior one was a custom request. I thought it turned out really well too! The additional of oil on our bodies certainly didn’t hurt!
3223 2018-10-04 17:37:27 Coconut oil on my skin >>>>
3224 2018-10-04 17:37:21 I think checking oil, water & tyre pressures and knowing how to top them up should be part of the whole learning how to drive remit. Everyone should know how to do those really.
3225 2018-10-04 17:37:19 Pump prices for gas is the same or lower than milk. We constantly hear about big oil companies and price fixing. Why not with the milk cartel? Am I missing something?
3226 2018-10-04 17:37:18 He liked the rain-washed Cornish air and smell of ploughed-up soil, he liked a landscape big and bare and painted it in oil. #betjeman #NationalPoetryDay
3227 2018-10-04 17:37:13 Hey @npure3 @foundmyfitness mentioned you so I bought some fish oil but small problem with your shopping cart, the address form only offers UK Address's ZIP code in numbers, not UK post codes which are a mixture of letters and numbers. Thanks, hopefully order went thru okay
3228 2018-10-04 17:37:11 One bottle of anointing oil for me, plis

3230 2018-10-04 17:36:57 Arrogant and brainless Modi & Ajit Doval think that they can ignore Trump's Warning on Russia S-400 and Iranian Oil....this act of non compliance to U.S will shortly cost the Endians,dearly...
3231 2018-10-04 17:36:56 just want everyone to know that Canola Oil is a fake name made up to conceal the true name of the plant it comes from. It's Rapeseed oil. 

You already know why they made up the fake name.
3232 2018-10-04 17:36:53 I love the inside, but cristal it's dangerous packaging for body oil. I liked the old one (plastic) HAHAHAHA
3233 2018-10-04 17:36:50 Untuk sementara export coconut oil masih stabil dan sebenarnya di luar kebutuhan pokok seperti beras, import tdk bisa dihindari peusahaan textile pasti impor raw cotton, perusahaan kaca, detergent pasti import sodah ash, feed mills import soy bean meal dst.
3234 2018-10-04 17:36:46 A spotty young fellow called Doyle
Liked to smother his visage with oil
It filled up his dimples
Then flowed past his pimples
And formed a small moat round his boil
#NationalPoetryDay2018
3235 2018-10-04 17:36:44 Because Bolton only cares about the Middle East and Iran in Particular.  Its time to enforce Monroe Doctrine and intervene teamed with Brazil and Colombia in "Oil Rich" Venezuela.
3236 2018-10-04 17:36:42 @guarnaschelli do you put oil in your pasta water?
3237 2018-10-04 17:36:32 Gonna want another brick in that purse there, hard guy.
3238 2018-10-04 17:36:28 and when you visit you only take out what you want to hear.......but never supply any evidence.  Your a bunch of oil snake sales men.
3239 2018-10-04 17:36:13 find you some cocoanut oil and play with ya meat, not me..
3240 2018-10-04 17:36:10 so yesterday I change my car oil all by myself and I didn’t break a single nail, you don’t know how proud i am and excited 
3241 2018-10-04 17:36:02 the doors that opened today, let them not shut, join me and drink this glass of anointing oil
3242 2018-10-04 17:35:55 @realDonaldTrump Mr. president what do you think of changing the oil trading currency $ to Chinese renminbi or euro ? Would strengthen the saudi currency and lower the dollar price :)
3243 2018-10-04 17:35:53 Pamper her nipples with oil, then fuck her tits.

3246 2018-10-04 17:35:38 Found out I'm allergic to bottle of oil
3247 2018-10-04 17:35:32 I have a break light, oil light, and engine light on in my car. Stay tuned to see if the green bean shits the bed on me again 
3248 2018-10-04 17:35:21 Frosties, o’s & Target brand coco pebbles cause they got the hydrogenated oil out the recipe
3249 2018-10-04 17:35:18 Is it not Essar Oil now Russian company?? Are Essar refinery are getting oil from Russia??
3250 2018-10-04 17:35:06 i really hate when i’m chillin making breakfast and oil pops onto my thigh 
3251 2018-10-04 17:35:03 Sir, y wait for 3 state elections to over , we will see rise tomorrow itself ** Traget for USD is $79 & Crude oil is $95 **
3252 2018-10-04 17:35:03 All those “get your oil changed” memes are aimed @ me
3253 2018-10-04 17:34:47 Skin so soft oil from Avon  after you shower, go to local shop and buy moscito repellent called “OFF” and spray on exposed skin. There in July, not one bite
3254 2018-10-04 17:34:46 Itll be crazy if oil does go for $100 a barrel by end of the year.
3255 2018-10-04 17:34:42 This was a rhetorical question, Pete. It was tongue in cheek. Did not anticipate an actual answer

And No... Money is not a super power. Ask Iraq or any of the Oil rich countries that have been recently destroyed by the US.

Whiteness definitely shields people from their fuckups!
3256 2018-10-04 17:34:41 It's the real time to launch ELECTRONIC CAR in INDIA.. to get a solution against oil prices ? Lol
3257 2018-10-04 17:34:37 Your initial argument was if you are not an exporter you dont have a claim to forex. You have just thrown in a good example. Oil companies get priority allocation of forex from RBZ because fuel is needed for economic activities including export business.
3258 2018-10-04 17:34:18 Very narrow confirmation vote should tell you something too.

The only question is if she's militant-feminist-nazi-anti-priveledge-white-boy-man-child far left or late-stage-capitalism-anti-oil-we-dont-deserve-this-planet-follow-the-acolytes far left.
3259 2018-10-04 17:34:09 E acabar com monopólio da mídia é algo necessário, não comunista. Em 1911, o "comunista" EUA acabou com o monopólio do petróleo da Standard Oil de John D. Rockefeller e desmembrou a empresa dele em outras várias (em torno de 40)
3260 2018-10-04 17:34:08 I use this tea tree oil from the body shop

3264 2018-10-04 17:33:35 Double cleansing - toner - face oil - natrep.
3265 2018-10-04 17:33:35 So if Oil turns down will rates too?

3267 2018-10-04 17:33:22 When Infiniti told me my oil change today was free that excited me. But FREE oil changes for 2 years is a whole different level of excitement 
3268 2018-10-04 17:33:22 How can a pipeline to Burnaby simultaneously allow for the survival&recovery of South Resident Orcas with all the increase in shipping. There is already too much underwater noise for them as it is? 2)why are the emissions from oil prod'n (to market) not counted in our emissions?
3269 2018-10-04 17:33:09 It's the antiquated grid stupid.

3274 2018-10-04 17:32:32 Word, of would be a curse instead of a blessing. Just look at Nigeria’s stewardship of their oil resources. The environment and people have suffered tremendously while a few benefit.
3275 2018-10-04 17:32:31 From what I understand the biggest components of the high yield ETF's are oil names.......hence the turn with USO down 2 pct today

u could run your car on hemp oil tho.
3284 2018-10-04 17:31:36 I am a Christian a follower of Jesus and I have an oil field in my backyard. I want to sell too
3285 2018-10-04 17:31:13 Hmmm! Maybe the foreign sugar and oil don't mix. Maybe if Bas and the George weekes had made a dougla it would have been a success, they only left the after births as their legacy.
3286 2018-10-04 17:31:10 Till Canadian oil is used i will also buy cheap usa dairy products. Quebec shut down Energy East
3287 2018-10-04 17:31:03 Certainly has in oil and gas BUT private equity has reshaped that and the Citadels of the world plus as TIC shows us the offshore palyers are massive but hey the algos are still parked as close as possible to the exchanges

3291 2018-10-04 17:30:44 The EU were categorical, that Scotland’s economy wasn’t big enough membership, and that their GDP wasn’t high enough to take in the Euro (They did change their mind after the vote). If independence had happened, Scotland would’ve been bankrupt now under Nicolas oil “prices”!

3305 2018-10-04 17:28:57 Whether this CM knows how much is tax levied by the Center and how much is taxed by State Government. First he should understand oil pricing and then demand/suggest
3306 2018-10-04 17:28:45 Mr illiterate yadav, you need some education to understand oil price mechanism. You were cm just just splurge public money. Never wanted to know what role center and state play in petro pricing. If few educated are there in your team they must be enjoying your comedy.

Saudi Arabia can't survive on its own and the income from pilgrimage won't be sufficient. Be pragmatic.

Brent crude oil futures were down $1.12, or 1.3 percent, at $85.17 a barrel by 12:13 p.m. ET (1613 GMT), having risen to a November 2014 high of $86.74 the day before.

3339 2018-10-04 17:24:49 I understand that China has withdrawn its 25% tariff on U.S. Oil imports. I believe that is good for U.S. oil co's. The Democratic crisis and controversy loving media has yet to report it. another win.
3340 2018-10-04 17:24:40 Jaitleyji you remembered, when #BJP was in opposition what's you said, if crued petrol $ 90 per barrel then petrol should be ₹ 50 per letter, Now today crued oil price $ 87, per barrel then why ₹91+ pre letter. How lies you speaks. #BJP & @Jaitley looting, #Jai Hind

3342 2018-10-04 17:24:26 Makes sense. But why BJP was so senseless to hit the streets before 2014 to force then Govt to hold the price or reduce the price so that h deficit is financed via Oil bonds? Did this wisdom dawn on them or their bhakts only today? Or they didn't care for the nation before 2014?
3343 2018-10-04 17:24:20 I want to say 2-3 weeks. I brushed coconut oil on my lashes at night too!
3344 2018-10-04 17:24:18 And yet somehow its just about 10% reduction in the prices that have escalated constantly for the last 36 months or so; even when $ n crude oil were both low! So hey @BJP4India govt, thanx for nothing! Elections round the corner have finally cornered your arrogance
3345 2018-10-04 17:24:11 My teacher’s gonna open my test booklet and find many spots of coconut oil. Sorry sis!

3368 2018-10-04 17:21:09 They clearly mentioned they they don't have money to run the govt.

#ModiFor2019 and has cut Rs.5
3440 2018-10-04 17:14:01 Things Liberal Republicanism and Democratic Conservatism worked together to get done: NAFTA, union busting, Wall Street deregulation, news media consolidation, welfare cuts, vote suppression, oil pipelines, mass incarceration and David Frum's pet cause: The Iraq War. #NoThankYou

3451 2018-10-04 17:13:01 The ordinary is an amazing brand and really cost friendly  also tea tree oil to spot treat and witch hazel has helped me a lot. I’ve also spot treated with Vick’s before bed and I swear it helps with cystic pimples lol. Try sticking with a gentle cleanser tho! Like Cera Ve

3456 2018-10-04 17:12:19 I am aware of the situation & why it is so comlex. You hardly find a mention of Baluchistan politics in mainstream Media. Such a vast province, having gold & copoer mountains, full of natural resources, 700 KMs coatal line with shale oil reserves & Gwadar, the Jewel the in Crown.
3457 2018-10-04 17:12:18 You and your girlfriend are no oil paintings either.

No jobs. Markets falling.
Big cause for worry. Wish some better heads ran the Finance Ministry!

Same thing was told to u in 2008, 2012, 2014.. U refused GST, u refused oil price cut when global oil prices wer at all time low.. Infact, #ChorCongress added 2% cess to fund their dirty deals..Jhoote sale

3471 2018-10-04 17:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: sad crust with stale motor oil and shrimp.
3472 2018-10-04 17:11:07 Hey, remember when BP had a humongous oil leak and everyone blamed Obama for not using his heat vision to melt the sea floor and fix it because the media was spoiling to knock him down a peg or two?
3473 2018-10-04 17:11:00 How about compensation to the 100k + Oil and gas workers and 100 billion dollar i dustry

3479 2018-10-04 17:10:12 Ask anyone and look it up it’s true the oil field is booming cause of the gas prices and when it’s booming more jobs for it and just wait a couple of months the prices are gunna rise
3480 2018-10-04 17:10:07 @BBCOne Why are you asking the British public to send their hard earned money to Indonesia? A country with vast deposits of gold, silver, oil and gas. Effectively asking the British public to another country's government's job! UK homelessness must be nonexistent then.
3481 2018-10-04 17:10:05 These words seem to threaten SAUDIA so as to look the OIL welfare of Big Boss US?????

3483 2018-10-04 17:09:55 Let's just call out what we suspect (with enough evidence to make a solid case), that Syria & Iran have been on the list since 1956 as countries the US/Britain has wanted dismantled, both for oil & racial reasons. D. Rockefeller had a vision of pipelines & pure bloodlines. #sick
3484 2018-10-04 17:09:55 But frying in vegetable oil, means you're infusing said food with extra veggie-ness...doesn't it??
3485 2018-10-04 17:09:52 I don’t know if I’m looking less ugly than i thought today or if the guy helping me with my oil change is just always that awkward?
3486 2018-10-04 17:09:51 The central issue is China has re-introduced gold settlement for oil delivery (#PetroGold) that was in place prior to 1974 undermining the #PetroDollar.

And Europe, UK, Russia, & China now accelerating the change w/ the Special Purpose Vehicle going live Oct.

Deal w/ the issue.
3487 2018-10-04 17:09:45 Money..control of oil, sales of war machines where huge profit exist in wars..the U.S. is in on this. Wall St. Corporations manufacturing war products,  profit. American taxes go into those corporation profit.

3495 2018-10-04 17:09:10 She left for the money ! Big Oil Hack .
3496 2018-10-04 17:09:10 Instead of relying on the demand of oil by foreign nations, Middle Eastern countries should invest in infrastructure, spy satellites, electronics, wind energy, fuel cells for electric cars, solar power, etc. The Gods will not make the oil disappear, but it is a limited resource.
3497 2018-10-04 17:09:09 SIXTH ECONOMIC SHAKE-UP?
If forecasters are right and oil is headed for $120, we are headed for a sixth price shock — and possibly a sixth economic shake-up.~ T.N. Ninan

3510 2018-10-04 17:08:36 They own 60 billion XRP. More than half the total supply... they own your coins in terms of value. If I owned 60% of the worlds oil or gold or anything then i may as well own the whole lot price wise. Basic economics 101.

3512 2018-10-04 17:07:59 Today's fact:

3521 2018-10-04 17:07:19 I do cause it means better oil industry which means more jobs for people so it’s actually bettering the economy
3522 2018-10-04 17:07:19 I'm sure it's just a coincidence that President Bush worked in the oil industry, in which Cheney and bin Laden also worked.
3523 2018-10-04 17:07:17 Exactly. And remember, Pence and several GOP senators are being investigated for ties with foreign oil companies and foreign bank accounts. They all want to get him confirmed, to help themselves before they get busted by the FBI.
3524 2018-10-04 17:07:16 After a peak in 2008 and drop, with ACES Alaska had the highest oil tax system of any state in the USA, so dollars went elsewhere and ultimately hurt production & AK in the long run. Palin did nothing meaningful and was over her head playing governor, hence resigning. (2 of 2)

* 400g chapatti flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* half cup flour for dusting the work surface
* 250ml boiling hot water

Knead then leave to rest for 10 mins.
You’ll get about 12 rotis from this dough
3529 2018-10-04 17:06:36 Ok so reading into this. The horizontal line that says it reps oil why is not black. Oil is black not gold. The star reps a bright future. So the picked the beige the dullest color ever. And the doubled on the beige which does not make since. Nice try but no.

3557 2018-10-04 17:03:51 Removing it when fresh is best, but using some tape to get the sticky up (even patting the just removed label on the sticky spot) will help.

3566 2018-10-04 17:03:24 Literally: to sell oil
3567 2018-10-04 17:03:21 Try cutting sugar the week before your period & also try Evening Primrose oil for that. I used to skip it every now and then & had no issues.
3568 2018-10-04 17:03:15 Oil is everything
3569 2018-10-04 17:03:03 Maybe, who knows? He'll have come to learn the whole "Squeakiest wheel gets the oil" can work with something's and somehow feel being rude is somehow ok.

Just hoping I don't have to deal with him again.

I found ways to manage it and perk up though afterwards ^^

3638 2018-10-04 16:57:00 Make me understand this: after fuel prices go up by 20 Rs, they get cut by Rs 2 and we ‘celebrate’? What happens now if oil crosses $100 a barrel? Is fuel state controlled or market driven or festival/election driven?
3639 2018-10-04 16:56:52 #JosPond...This fulanis should be given their own country for the rest of us to have peace. They should also be entitled to the oil money when they are gone. They don't want to go and they don't want us to live in peace!!

3698 2018-10-04 16:52:23 But once again the rural conservative uncles will be having fun and reminding the msm that President Donald Trump is still president and Justice Kavanaugh was a great pick by President Donald Trump.  Say it with me  President Donald Trump,  for 6 more years///
3699 2018-10-04 16:52:16 See ehn oga, whatever you say. I've seen you. You wreak of insincerity, bias instead. I'm sure this is the first time you're feeling the need to speak on issues on the Plateau. 

Pulizzzzz take a seat.
3700 2018-10-04 16:52:16 Rajdeep how oil prices reached even Rs 66 or so, there has been increase in all these years, why dollar from 38 in 2007-08 reaches 63 by 2014, analyse and put your tweet on this, if you are impartial otherwise you have no right for criticism only

3709 2018-10-04 16:51:10 Sugar high economy (nice term Col), while farmers struggling in IA & elsewhere due to trade war w/China. High tech jobs lost in IA too, due to Trump negating Obama mandates for better air brakes on oil trains. Affects US citizens & environment. Can guess who wanted this - Kochs.
3710 2018-10-04 16:51:02 Have you ever contributed time to a soup line or talked to the homeless? Many r mentally ill and why haven’t we taken care of them? Easily could when we spend $100,000 on a single rocket to kill people in oil rich countries.
3711 2018-10-04 16:51:01 Thank God no be only me see am yesterday
3712 2018-10-04 16:51:00 As expected. You didn’t drink anointing oil ?
3713 2018-10-04 16:50:53 But sir aapko bhi pata hai ki ye permanent solution nahi hai kyonki jis hishab se oil price badh raha hai ye kami bhi jald hi barabar ho jaegi iska ek hi option hai petrolium product ko gst k dayre me laya jana chahiye

3715 2018-10-04 16:50:42 For insects I use neem oil. I'm cautious with it because it is a good pesticide but if you spray the plant while budding then the oil can be trapped in the plant. I forget what the term is but you can get very sick if you smoke neem oil. I try to spray around the plant. Not on it
3716 2018-10-04 16:50:41 Bureaucrats never learn, they just don't. They think they are oversmart @arunjaitley
Market Cap of PSU Oil OMC's fell by a full Rs 55000 Crores today. Just to save Rs 7000 extra going into the fiscal deficit by passing on Rs 1 per litre hit to OMCs.
Not a sound economic decision
3717 2018-10-04 16:50:41 Base metal prices sharply lower on global growth concerns with Copper leading metal prices lower. Oil lower too as the Dow Jones falls more than 250 points. Some respite for Emerging Mkt currencies as the US dollar pares early gains.

3728 2018-10-04 16:49:45 Please what is the use of the anointing oil? Lol
3729 2018-10-04 16:49:37 I love baby oil

3736 2018-10-04 16:48:55 Same here, girl. That’s why I want to cut it :( I’d recommend cutting it a couple inches just tell them you still want to keep it at a similar length so they don’t over do it  But who knows maybe that shampoo will work for you! Try coconut oil
3737 2018-10-04 16:48:50 @realDonaldTrump your friend Saudi killing poor nations by manipulating oil prices
3738 2018-10-04 16:48:38 Totally fair JT, but for me, I’ve been thinking this way since before he was dealt. Badly wanted the Oil to get him. RARE guy who craves the spotlight in the league

3754 2018-10-04 16:47:04 No use of cut on fuel prices now because it's only a political decision to winNfew state elections like a decision@Dmoment of Karnataka election.Govt says on Iran crisis&other issues but not on oil pooling, hike of several taxes,GST on fuel.The same result may repeatN elections.
3755 2018-10-04 16:46:54 Economic crisis in India is not bcos of heavy oil imports, stop fooling people. We have been importing oil always, why not accept ur economic policy failure which u aren’t capable of handling. Super mess of indian economy is ur definition of ache din@ShashiTharoor @sadhavi

3759 2018-10-04 16:46:40 Apple/orange comparison given entire economy and social structure are not same. 
In many cases U.S workers would pay $0 fed or even state taxes. A basic 8% tax applies to all income before state, local, municipal, health taxes kick in at $7,500 U.S.

3777 2018-10-04 16:44:51 Bad NEWS, we can get along without  Oil !!!

3789 2018-10-04 16:43:59 There is no THC ( the psychoactive part of cannabis) in CBD oil- so you don’t get ‘stoned’. I used to smoke weed and found that when I was stoned I felt worse as I went deep into my thoughts and they became all consuming and I obsessed over every little thing.
3790 2018-10-04 16:43:42 Are you really this naive or giving away your bias? Pappu was screaming Petrol is so expensive. So Modi makes a smart political move... Give a away 90 Paise forces Oil cos to part a Rupee and States 60! Now @RahulGandhi can't see we lost 60. So comes out a loser!

3806 2018-10-04 16:42:22 Yup. In this current economic space and attention economy that has been created, everyone is terrified of being called a snake oil salesman.

3837 2018-10-04 16:39:53 So, chemistry twitter: Heating reactions.  I've mostly used oil and occasionally sand baths in the past, but have heard good things about using metal beads and/or blocks.  Any suggestions out there? (Especially for doing it on the cheap) #RealTimeChem
3838 2018-10-04 16:39:52 Our VP commented that China made a shitty deal with Venezuela for oil. China's "government" controls all the money to deal as they choose. They don't have the accountability and approval we have. It's not fair but it is the reality. It's why we need to get from under China's grip
3839 2018-10-04 16:39:49 A lot of lower-educated men moved to ND during its oil boom, which has fizzled out considerably in the last few years, and now they are bitter?

3857 2018-10-04 16:38:33 Seeing that a man could have his life destroyed and reputation ruined, only for the political gain of the opposing side does not set well with me, a conservative woman.
3858 2018-10-04 16:38:31 Waiting at St. John Brake & Muffler, (5000 St. John Ave) for a quick and cheap oil change, when a man walks in, apparently notices my boots, my skinny jeans, my buffalo plaid flannel, and my manly man bun, so he tells me "Sir, Westport is that way,"

It blows my mind people are okay with this dipshit running your country.  Come to Canada.lots of land and normalcy, jobs. We stopped oil pipelines and replaced it with weed 
3862 2018-10-04 16:38:09 Everyone knows about economic crisis EXCEPT OUR FM!! Bad propaganda by the Opposition! is the standard reply.
India facing economic crisis, says Union minister @nitin_gadkari blaming huge oil imports. But fuel earning of 12 lakh crore govt saved the BJP govt from bankruptcy?
3863 2018-10-04 16:38:02 @fordnation - very disappointed to see retail gas prices now HIGHER than before you eliminated the tax - time to stand up for Ontario drivers and make oil companies justify every penny increase all the time
3864 2018-10-04 16:37:59 Great! When I posted ab this sometime back, some guy said as if "Harvard would care" about what Indian govt feels or says. This comes as a KITA to such guys. But, Coconut Oil is poison for the PUFA loaded vegetable oil industry starting from CRISCO (P&G propaganda) days 
3865 2018-10-04 16:37:56 When the price of oil goes up, you pay the same percentage fuel tax but more of it!

3871 2018-10-04 16:37:29 It was disappointing to see a T Cruz sign in front of a long arts patron and acquaintance here in Houston Heights.  However the owner is an oil guy, so he's voting his own interest.

3880 2018-10-04 16:36:50 At a time when international crude oil prices have been CUT by 21$ per barrel, the center continues to LOOT and EXPLOIT the common citizen with such heavy fuel prices. But the people of India are much smarter than this. They won't be fooled by BJPs silly tricks.

3890 2018-10-04 16:36:17 Fuel prices going to cost you very dearly... Your party is loosing all state assemblies in the coming elections. The oil price affected people have taken the decision.
3891 2018-10-04 16:36:04 And we don't need to leave coal #miners & oil riggers flapping in the wind. The #transition will take a decade give/take.

3906 2018-10-04 16:34:16 Worst thing about governments shortsightedly backing fracking, oil production, gas extraction, entire coal industry (incl. clean coal, DumbMF is an idiot) is, in 5-10 years they will all be completely obsolete. Electric/ solar disruption & adoption is inevitable at this point.

3914 2018-10-04 16:33:51 Indians are not fools. We don't need 2rupee cut on oil prices. We will show what we can do. Your party is going to loose the state assemblies and Center. Your arrogant decisions are going to cost your party prospects. It's not too late. You have enough time to win the confidence

3919 2018-10-04 16:33:20 Please tell me you don't believe this is good for the country. The government has given into political pressure, simple because crude oil prices haven't gone down and ₹ hasn't strengthened against $.
3920 2018-10-04 16:32:55 Actually creates inequality. In a high cost of living area may not be a " living wage." Where I live $15 has nearly twice the purchasing power. No rational economist can defend a national min wage as being equal across the country.

3979 2018-10-04 16:27:47 there is a town in China completely focused on mass-production of oil paintings, where for example a single artist made 400 replicas of the same painting, and Wal-Mart alone orders thousands of paintings each month
3980 2018-10-04 16:27:45 Totally agree w/ all that it's odd to demand that specialized workers do diff't work. But, on the other hand, imagine: gender studies & critical race studies profs seconded to film & tv industries; ethics profs seconded to boardrooms; environmental scientists to oil companies...

3983 2018-10-04 16:27:24 Lol just watched one of those new @FordTrucks cam locking oil plugs explode in a dudes hand.

Plastic is no material to make your powertrain out of.
3984 2018-10-04 16:27:20 Having rallied to four-year highs, oil prices took a breather ahead of US sanctions on Iran, but investors remained bullish on the prospect of $100 per barrel following reports of increased activity in the US options market.
3985 2018-10-04 16:27:15 use either coconut oil or olive oil to remove
3986 2018-10-04 16:27:12 Getting Iranian oil off the global market is part of the Trump admin’s strategy to help Russia.
3987 2018-10-04 16:27:04 Maybe you should have thought of that back in 2000 when you chose consumption (of Mideast oil etc) over conservation, jes sayin.
3988 2018-10-04 16:26:57 Just used olbas oil for the first time in my life and it's fucking class! Although I would advise reading the instructions first if you don't want to be nearly blinded

3990 2018-10-04 16:26:44 Analyst Gustavo Fingeret writes on Colombia looking at the impact from tax reform, 2019 GDP growth, and unconventional Oil & Gas. He sees MSCI Colombia as attractive at a 20% discount to its 7-yr historical fwd P/E. We prefer financials over energy/cement/consumer names.
3991 2018-10-04 16:26:37 Stupid statement.  I'll take 85% of something over 100% of nothing any day.

3994 2018-10-04 16:26:28 Thank you for yletting it great work disrupting oil production. We need distractions like yours so we can clear cut forest, export coal and dump sewer in whatever water we want. Keep up the good work
3995 2018-10-04 16:26:20 He'd then probably go on to tell you that Scotland's economy is in no way dependent on oil, and that it is in fact the only country in the UK that has a balance of trade surplus, as opposed to England's £122bn deficit.  Why let the facts get in the way of a good rant though eh?
3996 2018-10-04 16:26:16 Neem oil is the most stank ass shit ever yet so useful for hair care.
3997 2018-10-04 16:26:09 Yeah Mike, told you do that..
Very viable repercussion. Their revolution would have kept that oil reserve near us.
3998 2018-10-04 16:26:04 @BMW_UK Furious with your service at Ipswich branch. Took 5 weeks to replace head unit under warranty. Service then done and gear box oil not sealed properly. Clutch blew up 200 yards from dealership and I had to push the car back. Now told no refund possible for service.

4002 2018-10-04 16:25:44 If Eddie goes they need a new board.  The current set up is geared to the long term benefit of just one individual no matter what the share price does.  

Needs a USA focussed and experienced board of oil people.  

Given the assets and WTI that combo should reinvigorate it.

Any nation against the #PetroDollar also a #NationalSecurity threat.

4021 2018-10-04 16:24:06 I’m the most extra and impatient person I know. Whenever I need an oil change, I make sure someone’s there to pick me up and take me back when my car is ready because I hate sitting there and waiting

Not much incentive to go the extra mile anymore. The laziest person makes the same as the motivated. Meritocracy encourages a more productive workforce, this encourages mediocrity
4029 2018-10-04 16:23:45 I miss late afternoon thunderstorms. The odd translucent greenish quality to the light. Flicking tiny waterdrops off screen doors. The rising gritty smell of oil and dust, which I only learned was named "petrichor" after I no longer dwelt in the land of rain.
4030 2018-10-04 16:23:45 We just won't factor in the cost of the short and long term environmental destruction. But since all the real costs of what was done and continues to be done to secure oil from the ME, along with the Russian environmental damage in Siberia, has always been unspoken, nothing new.

4074 2018-10-04 16:19:25 It seems that #Trump indicated that Saudi Arabia is a puppet government and they have the power to take over their assets at any time. This is why, Trump has created crisis in Middle East to take control of oil, so they could control world, and isolate those country who oppose US
4075 2018-10-04 16:19:23 Big European #oil companies are spurning #EU efforts to shield Iranian crude from #USsanctions because of fears that they would leave businesses exposed to harsh penalties from the Trump administration.
4076 2018-10-04 16:19:15 When are we going to tell the UN to get out of our business? I mean it is not like the organization is above all others. I clearly remember the food for oil scandal. Ah, we have a great president who knows what he is doing.

4103 2018-10-04 16:16:52 But shale oil boom post 2008 meant falling market share for OPEC, and falling prices in spite of quota discipline through 2014. Coming to terms w/ that new reality included Saudi production surge in 2015, further tanking prices.

4115 2018-10-04 16:16:06 Check your Engine oil today.
4116 2018-10-04 16:16:04 Well it’s as real as one can find at Naheed. It isn’t the sliced/processed one but it’s also not the high end one. There’s a blue cheese, a havarti, some sharp cheddar, some Cheese that comes in a jar with some oil.
4117 2018-10-04 16:15:55 Finance Minister @arunjaitley ji today announced marginal relief for citizens from runaway fuel prices with excise duty cut of Rs 1.50 and another Re 1 drop by oil marketing companies, taking the cut in fuel prices to Rs 2.50. Thank you FM @arunjaitley and PM @narendramodi ji.
4118 2018-10-04 16:15:50 Once I wanted to cook so I cracked an egg, poured flower on it, and put some oil in it. Tasted terrible. Do not recommend

4121 2018-10-04 16:15:35 My heart is a curved thing 
Made of worn cypress and lavender oil 
She throws it carelessly when she’s threw with me 
And I return to her violently 
Because she molded the 
Way I learned to love 
And I’m constantly trying 
To get her to see me

-US accuses OPEC of withholding 1.42 million bpd in spare capacity
-KSA responds "the market is well supplied. Some would even say oversupplied."
-Russia says oil could go to $100 but would prefer lower
HAVE THEY LOOKED AT THE REST OF THE GALAXY? #OOTT
4129 2018-10-04 16:14:40 Guys please understand out of this 2.50 reduction, only 1.5 RS is from excise.  The other Rs is being absorbed by oil marketing companies not the Govt.
4130 2018-10-04 16:14:27 
Oil...grass...gravel...this could be the new thing. 
4131 2018-10-04 16:14:26 Yes,Oil Marketing Companies help to govt contain subsidy.
The govt indecision on free pricing of petroleum products.
Crude prices decline then take a hit.
When prices go up,we gain profit.
PSU losses of Crore of Rupees it's starting us alarm.
The global economy survive in crises.
4132 2018-10-04 16:14:26 Asking government about oil prices is like asking bollywood to speak on sexual harassment. #TanushreeVsBollywood #OilShock

4136 2018-10-04 16:14:09 President Trump repeatedly humiliates the Saudis by saying they can't last 2 weeks without his support.
The Saudis should show zeal and say to Tramp: If two weeks later, oil closes oil so expensive that the Americans are shaken.

4140 2018-10-04 16:13:25 To me what matters most is the utilisation of the tax what govt Takes from us...and as far as we all know that almost everything has been constructed 2 times more than the previous govt In the same span of time..oil companies did make profit which was utilised for public welfare

4145 2018-10-04 16:13:08 #FuelPriceCut while it was needed and states also should follow the same - it is not sustainable in the long term. Govt needs to reduce dependency on importing oil by - 1. encouraging other fuels such as biogas and methanol , 2. laying down clear policy on hybrid/EVs

4147 2018-10-04 16:13:03 Cut it up into chip size pieces, very lightly coat with some oil (even just spray it) sprinkle a little bit of salt. Bake at 400 until the edges just start to brown. Then you have super crispy kale chips, that shit is delicious
4148 2018-10-04 16:12:55 We have only a temporary reason to get relief with fall of Petrol-Diesel prices. Govt has just made a little comprise, not prepared policy to control the oil price. If price continues to rise this amount will be crossed within a few days.

Ayaba Cho after rushing to sign an oil deal in the UK, he jumps back to put his signature again here while also authorising his thugs to kill civilians. SCAMMERS
4154 2018-10-04 16:12:43 Based on my experience with it, my shrink has recommended CBD oil to about a half dozen of her patients. So there’s that.
4155 2018-10-04 16:12:38 Know that this won't be about trashing Trump, although many things may slip out, which is unavoidable for the evidence he provides daily. So, #particulates kill.

4162 2018-10-04 16:12:19 in my town, they force fed us a gas fired plant 
then secretly installed a 1 million gallon tank and filled it with OIL to burn "when gas costs too much"
and it gulps 1 million gallons of drinking water a day(whole town uses 4) -  reclaiming zero steam
4163 2018-10-04 16:12:18 And Yemeni oil reserves, as much as Kuwait, mostly in the south.
4164 2018-10-04 16:12:18 Religion does not matter at all. A man who rapes and murders a woman on a college campus does not do it for religion. A woman who drowns her children because she finds them annoying does not do it for religion. Governments going to war over oil does not do it for religion. Etc.
4165 2018-10-04 16:12:17 Dude I know!!  I’ve been trying everything!! Stairs, walking, exercising. I even tried the castor oil (the worst taste ever) and NOTHING.  I’m so anxious. :(

4167 2018-10-04 16:12:12 Rs 25 up and Rs 1.50 down.   Nothing great and no reaction needed.   We need more protests from the opposition for more reduction.

We don't want to give credit to govt. For the Rs 1.00 additional reduction by the oil marketing companies.   Got it?
4168 2018-10-04 16:12:04 A lot of chitter-chatter about #e15 rvp waiver coming from Iowa next week.  
Unfortunately, without allowing access thru the current pump infrastructure (that is controlled by regulations heavily influenced by big oil and merchant refiners), the waiver will have minimal impact
4169 2018-10-04 16:11:58 This is too late and not a solution at all. Consider the following points. Allow Oil Cos to take FC loans, increase the intrest rate slightly, have a barter trade arrangement with Iran, curtail imports from China and increase exports. #FuelPriceRelief
4170 2018-10-04 16:11:57 Trading crude oil and Es for most is a expensive addiction, truthfully the 50 to 1 leverage will make anyone feel euphoria similar to black jack. I'm not saying some can't buy yachts with the instrument, but the odds you can are slim

4173 2018-10-04 16:11:44 How the fuck can someone make jokes about the US military invading anywhere with oil for greedy reasons, but then turn around and support the US military in all of its real life endeavors? Like where is the disconnect?

4190 2018-10-04 16:10:26 So nobody's going to talk about the fact that 40% of oil price cut is government regulating oil companies? AGAIN?
Come on! Reaching this system had taken so much effort! :/

4194 2018-10-04 16:10:07 @arunjaitley @ravishndtv As you had reduce price from today this will be fixed as the prices are daily increased by 10, 13, 26 paise by oil companies, if they increase daily  again from tomorrow then it's of no Use, what you reduced will cover-up slowly slowly within a week ...
4195 2018-10-04 16:10:06 It makes sense though. If I keep washing away the oils on my skin, it’ll just be like “lol MORE OIL THEN!!” Maybe I should skip a few days a week and see what goes on

4214 2018-10-04 16:08:36 Why thank you! Just dont wash it 
The caveat here is that I've never had acne or oil problems before. But I've also never consistently washed it. Coincidence?

4217 2018-10-04 16:08:26 If you are referring to the USA's oil crisis of '73, I agree. Initially Jap cars were bought for fuel economy, out of necessity. But that changed over time as the Japs intro newer models & better quality etc vs American brands. Muscle is like Sports Cars. Dream vs practical buy

4228 2018-10-04 16:07:47 I switched to amsoil signature series oil , and change at 15,000 even tho it’s guaranteed for 25,000.
4229 2018-10-04 16:07:37 They only cut it by Rs.1. Now let the state govt cut about 1.5? After all vat is an ad valorem tax and so when the oil prices go up so will the state revenue but the revenue for center remains same. So state govt's are in better position to cut taxes
4230 2018-10-04 16:07:36 Balls, ppl r going to pay taxes now, we paid taxes for national build up, not for pm and his mantris to have foreign trips and enjoy themselves, and by the way government is taxing us indirectly through oil so the tax authority needs to fuck off

4235 2018-10-04 16:07:19 Isn't oil price internationally only US$ 85 per barrel and is still well below US$ 140 per barrel during UPA 2?   

Then why all this story building?
4236 2018-10-04 16:07:17 Three of those states did have oil-based economic booms during that time period. And there was a lot of year to year variation in Wyoming, driven by fluxes in oil revenue.
4237 2018-10-04 16:07:01 Yes it's looking suspicious that sudden drop off in power with no plumes of oil smoke once engine is turned on. Wonder what that was all about 
4238 2018-10-04 16:06:54 I feeeeel that. I always had way more energy. I got a lil cbd oil so hopefully that’ll help me relax. Love the ganja but it’s time.

4240 2018-10-04 16:06:39 This is catastrophic. Assuming that all oil CO’s and their sub trades are in compliance with permits and insurance and that all of the Loss Control measures are in place? Highly unlikely.
4241 2018-10-04 16:06:33 Montana might beat Wyoming. Maybe. That's about it though. California has a real economy, that is a diverse economy. Texas would go broke if not for gas and oil.

4246 2018-10-04 16:06:15 #UKOG #ANGUS Kimmeridge oil will be gushing all over the Weald. Swampies gutted. Market makers on Aim and shorts still have their head in the sand . What a fantastic buying opportunity. Filling my boots before they rocket imo.

4249 2018-10-04 16:05:52 This has to be the first Govt in history that squandered opportunities presented with lowest international oil prices and upsurge in global economy riding out recession. Now another international downturn, rising oil prices is staring at them. #EveryDayPolicies not the answer.
4250 2018-10-04 16:05:45 I've just posted a new blog: Congress says Centre's fuel price cut is 'panic reaction' ahead of polls

The government announced a Rs 2.50 per litre cut in petrol and diesel prices after it reduced excise duty by Rs 1.50 a litre and asked oil companies to absorb another Re 1.…
4251 2018-10-04 16:05:44 The humble can of oil.  Not only do you use it for lighting lanterns, it can blacken your blades, oil those locks and hinges, help start damp firewood, improvised Molotov, be used in a trap, help make torches and be used as material in a spell. It is truly a multi purpose item.

With oil revenues Abia state can't be compared to Osun state base on amenities

4257 2018-10-04 16:05:23 hjoly shit 

I remember running out of heating oil on friday evening, called the service company and said they'll show up at monday (whcih they did thaknfully) but i had to shower under the cold and it was not pleasant
4258 2018-10-04 16:05:22 @realScottWagner you called a teen activist 'young and naive' for challenging your claim that climate change is caused by human body heat - but its ok to accept $200,000 -Return your $200k from Big Oil and Sign the No Fossil Fuel Money
4259 2018-10-04 16:05:16 Is that not Nadeeya and her bro
4260 2018-10-04 16:05:02 Went and got an oil change by myself wow I’m an independent woman.
4261 2018-10-04 16:05:02 The 1% in US want Saudi oil, the Saudis want the Yemenis dead, the US will do nothing
Millions will die
4262 2018-10-04 16:04:56 If opec or the Saudis decide to sell oil in some other currency, US would be on a civil war in few weeks..
4263 2018-10-04 16:04:55 21 ไม่เด็กแล้วนะออย
4264 2018-10-04 16:04:52 Furthermore the oil companies claims that this will kill jobs and hurt small businesses are based on hearsay and guesses
4265 2018-10-04 16:04:46 Rashi- ordinary Mincha mixed with oil requires one log.
4266 2018-10-04 16:04:44 @LagosTalks913 ..if you say its the oil price that brought about 100% devaluation...now the oil price is around 86$ per barrel..i see no effect on the currency
4267 2018-10-04 16:04:42 Central government should have reduce ed the oil price much earlier...
4268 2018-10-04 16:04:38 Red oil, foolo, ogbonno, garri! Ur food for eight is ready. Serve it hot so they can sweat it out
4269 2018-10-04 16:04:37 デビルマン(//∇//)
4270 2018-10-04 16:04:36 Actually no. Oil and other industries were nationalized and given as plums to non business savvy friends of the government. If this ever happens in any system of government you know it will be over soon.
4271 2018-10-04 16:04:34 Oil change, mani, breakfast, lunch, dinner, gas... I have to get all that with $100.. you think I can do it?

4275 2018-10-04 16:04:20  Damn poachers, damn oil palm.
4276 2018-10-04 16:04:19 China is still a bigger threat. Russia is a gas station. Cut more into their oil and gas, which we are doing thanks to shale and fracking, and their economy takes a huge hit. China, OTOH, is stealing our IP and engaged in unfair trade. @realDonaldTrump realizes these issues.

4281 2018-10-04 16:03:52 Good afternoon twitter, Clean your car out and change your oil for once
4282 2018-10-04 16:03:47 Before humiliating #SaudiArabia, #Trump should remember the time when US President ran to the kingdom to beg them to trade oil in dollars as other countries started dumping dollars.
4283 2018-10-04 16:03:47 If you're a 20 something millionaire playing a road game in Vegas, NYC or LA and can't find anything better to do than burn the midnight oil on video games perhaps you need to hire Sergei Kostitsyn as your tour guide. Seriously guys. As for Laine, it was a solid chirp.

4286 2018-10-04 16:03:36 Crude oil down a solid 2% #OOTT
4287 2018-10-04 16:03:31 Crude oil deals done only in US dollars.
US dollar is a standard for business internationally.
4288 2018-10-04 16:03:30 I hate goin to get an oil change.
4289 2018-10-04 16:03:25 Oh, yeah. I do this to increase my daily fat intake. (Even though I prefer coconut oil, as it's easier to find around here.)
4290 2018-10-04 16:03:18 This Akamai CEO is very RUDE and ARROGANT. How is he sitting???
4291 2018-10-04 16:03:16 so you went to walmart and got your oil changed?
4292 2018-10-04 16:03:07 Maybe this might work:mix this tissue oil with glycerin and spirit. It worked for me
4293 2018-10-04 16:02:58 When President @realDonaldTrump tells King Salman that if the United States does not support #Saudi_Arabia, it will not last for even two weeks, it’s obvious Saudi can not be expected to oppose the command from the #US to increase its #oil production./1 #OOTT #OPEC
4294 2018-10-04 16:02:57 The money involved in oil and gas is staggering and makes me feel completely powerless.
4295 2018-10-04 16:02:51 #FuelPriceRelief – When it comes to crude oil prices the government of India has no absolutely control: @narendrataneja of @BJP4India, tells @bhupendrachaube on #Viewpoint.
4296 2018-10-04 16:02:50 Oil prices are backing off today, but I am skeptical of talk of secret agreement for Saudis and Russia to boost output.  It is not secret.  Still not enough to offset Iran embargo.  Even with today's retreat, prices are up dramatically over this 4-week run.
4297 2018-10-04 16:02:48 For me I don't see PDP being a credible opposition in a country of smart people after 16 yrs  of failure & merciless stealing of public funds. During those years while oil was booming, other countries were exploring that period to grow and develop their country.

4302 2018-10-04 16:02:17 This no brain will not tell you that the states there don't tax so much on oil. If you believe or @MamataOfficial believes you're crap then reduce tax by your gov
4303 2018-10-04 16:01:53 If you are planning on oral surgery, it is important to share your list of medications and supplements with your dentist. That is because some supplements like fish oil or ginkgo biloba can increase your risk of bleeding.
4304 2018-10-04 16:01:50 I gotta stay off that oil boy 
4305 2018-10-04 16:01:46 They are trying to make Saudi Arabia guilty since it has had good progress by letting women driver, work as taxi drivers and now having movie theaters.All of this was permited by their religious institutions led by various corrupted oil princes.
4306 2018-10-04 16:01:36 For most of us whose main concern is humanity and not our subgroups of religious, tribal, or regional affiliates, we make efforts to find out what's actually happening, not come on Twitter to puff and to huff and achieve nothing, try to do the same, you're educated, act like it!
4307 2018-10-04 16:01:16 Cenk's friend Sedef Buyakamatan got some award from Trump, which she's very proud of. She helped Trump essentially at Standing Rock when she also helped out Wood jr's org, Nexus & whomever/whatever else cuz Nexus & the rest wanted the oil pipeline in North Dakota!

4311 2018-10-04 16:01:08 Edward Cross of @KIOGAKansas at #ksecon: oil & gas production will continue to rise, but facing challenges of labor shortage (like construction & manufacturing) & tariffs
4312 2018-10-04 16:00:37 Uncle, the last time I checked, I was pointing out an angle not justifying it. Know the difference
4313 2018-10-04 16:00:37 You know why Govt reduced Oil prices? There will be more hikes round the corner due to high international oil prices and sliding rupee.
4314 2018-10-04 16:00:32 Regardless of what you put on a taco, it's GOT to be a corn tortilla, and it's GOT to be run through hot oil before you put it together!

4319 2018-10-04 16:00:19 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4320 2018-10-04 16:00:16 My parents just got on the cooking with coconut oil fad.. imma just stop eating 
4321 2018-10-04 16:00:15 Still, truffle oil should inspire a little rage.
4322 2018-10-04 16:00:12 why do we pay for heating oil if we can literaly just go outside
4323 2018-10-04 16:00:08 Is it possible to convince some countries to take indian rupies instead of US dollar for  crude oil. This may help to control the fall of indian rupies.  @narendramodi

4330 2018-10-04 15:59:41 Oil halu terus
4331 2018-10-04 15:59:35 This is most likely the result of a treaty that prevents the vehicles from being used against the US or our allies. It's not good for the environment, but neither is a genocidal war or burning oil fields.
4332 2018-10-04 15:59:30   OIL PRICES  
4333 2018-10-04 15:59:09 今日もどこかで
4334 2018-10-04 15:59:02 loling at the idea of a PC that runs on a gasoline engine. It's a pull start. You have fill it up and change the oil. When running CPU-intensive programs the motor screams. Your house is full of exhaust. You can shift gears (programs) with alt+tab, etc.
4335 2018-10-04 15:58:58 I love driving a food truck the size of a house, with an open gas line, a cauldron of boiling oil, and a screaming hot grill while listening to Amy Winehouse and zoning out
4336 2018-10-04 15:58:55 Atleast cut the prices of oil  what the central govt has cut, do not indulge your polictics in every matter whatever the Modi govt choose to do
4337 2018-10-04 15:58:55 Free oil change and patch for my tire 
4338 2018-10-04 15:58:52 That's a Wrong step taken...
What now if crude oil rates go up.
Just a rupee burden on OMCS caused panic.
4339 2018-10-04 15:58:47 GO BEACH! As an alum, I always hated Pete. Thought it was stupid a SoCal school mascot was the 49ers simply because campus was founded in 1949. Not a lot of mining, oil yes, not metals in LB. We referred to ourselves as beach. I am okay with this.
4340 2018-10-04 15:58:43 All political parties,’centre and state, should agree to bring petrol/diesel under GST if they really are concerned about consumer. When FM is forced to announce a price cut on behalf of oil marketing cos, you realise that fuel price deregulation is irrational
4341 2018-10-04 15:58:42 Bhai central mai ek party hai poori majority ke saath.. jab woh demonetization kr skte h to koi Oil mai GST mai lana unke liye koi badi baat hai.. dusri party par baat daal dene se kuch nhi hoga .
4342 2018-10-04 15:58:42 Calculate karo crude oil and then tell bro. Sc ST amendment Bill pass ho jati hai court k decision Ko null and void kar. Par ram mandir par court order chaiye q Naa is per bhi bill le aao.
4343 2018-10-04 15:58:27 Actually no. Our dollar is valued worldwide because that's the currency accepted for countries to buy oil in the Middle East. It's about the oil. Big reason we went after Sadam no one talks about is b/c he threatened to change accepted currency to Euros. Our money would b garbage
4344 2018-10-04 15:58:11 Recently one of NDA minister said price is not in their control, Today FM declare a tax cut+ 1.00 cut from oil company. Is the deregulation of the price is a reality?. It is an upcoming election soap after increasing 25 rs and reduce 2.5 rs is nothing
4345 2018-10-04 15:58:09 The CBD oil i've been taking has changed my life I haven't felt this calm and sociable in YEARS
4346 2018-10-04 15:58:03 She looks surprisingly good for someone who just apparently suffocated.
4347 2018-10-04 15:57:59 कैसे आदमी हो? फिर बुद्धू बनाने की कोशिश? क्या समझते हो अपने आप को और क्या समझते हो हमें? उस वक्त international crude oil price 150 $ per barrel था जो अब उस से आधे से भी कम है।कभी गलती से ही ईमानदार हो जाता करो कि अपने आका की आदतें छोड़ने नहीं सकते?
4348 2018-10-04 15:57:51 The team and I just bought two essential oil diffusers for the office because it stinks haha

4357 2018-10-04 15:57:14 What Trump said today is a reality since 1919 when Hejaz province (incl.Mecca & Medina) of Turkish empire was handed over by British agents to desert dakus Saud tribe led by Abdel Aziz & a new country was carved in anticipation of huge oil reserves discovered in Dharan/Gulf.
4358 2018-10-04 15:57:06 Sorry. You need palm oil
4359 2018-10-04 15:57:04 Planes are literally the safest forms of transportation just because of these kinds of safety protocols. Minor oil leak? GROUNDED MUST FIX. And yet. People drive cars with oil leaks all the time. Could light up at any minute. Heck I’ve done it !
4360 2018-10-04 15:56:53 Lulurnya greentea, almond crush, whey, canola oil... Endeeesss di kulit!
4361 2018-10-04 15:56:48 I do not think the government will look into it because there is no crude oil and voter cards inside that pond
4362 2018-10-04 15:56:41 The taxation money is used for the govt spending only. And after all if govt will be reducing the prices, then the people will recklessly use it , they won't bother about the implications of high crude oil. Inflation is under control and now govt reduced the price for the people.
4363 2018-10-04 15:56:38 I'm realizing my tweet could be misinterpreted.

Heat pumps vs. gas is where I usually play, it requires improved homes in cold climates for cost parity.

Heat pumps in old homes vs. oil and propane is a fair matchup.

BUT if carbon pricing hits, there will be FF regret...
4364 2018-10-04 15:56:36 Your actually comparing it to coffee?
And non addictive lol
Do some research on it chap.
The medical uses of the oil are different to the "recreational use" drug addicts smoke.
4365 2018-10-04 15:56:20 Can we supply EU nations with OUR OIL & GAS?
4366 2018-10-04 15:56:18 Abi is't because it has nothing to do with sharing of ministerial appointments or oil well allocation which may have direct effects on their interest?
4367 2018-10-04 15:56:18 3 hours just for a dam oil change & they still arent done 
4368 2018-10-04 15:56:17 Wondering if you have an essential oil diffuser in your room? I have to be on medication for my panic disorder but since I became addicted to my lavender oil I’ve noticed a big diff in the mood swings. Helps me stay more even & def less anxiety w less meds?
4369 2018-10-04 15:56:13 @maxlugavere Do you have a favorite olive oil brand? Just read your book and curious if you’ve found one you stick to. Thanks!
4370 2018-10-04 15:56:05 lets not forget the part where he is one of the largest individual consumers of oil on the planet - and very possibly THE largest private citizen consumer
4371 2018-10-04 15:55:58 She had her chance.
4372 2018-10-04 15:55:43 Nonsense.. that is alie told by Modi govt. They only paid 5000 crores in oil bond but earned 11L crore from the people... Not they sucked the blood of the people
4373 2018-10-04 15:55:41 Got Squirrel oil?
4374 2018-10-04 15:55:39 One thing is 100% sure. Your oil demand graph (that ends in a 2018 estimate) tells absolutely nothing about EV adoption going forward.
4375 2018-10-04 15:55:35 The GOP’s ruthlessness wins.
Taxes bad. Spending bad(unless we do it)
2 get your way-lie, cheat, steal N Jesus’ name.
Change the rules N the guise of moral superiority.
Power is easily gained by serving the ultra rich, big oil, big banks, big corporations & U get $$$ as well
4376 2018-10-04 15:55:26 Now the Gramma is focusing her Q&A on vaping & oil pens: 

“My friend had this device, it looked like a cell phone. And she called it a one hitter. Is that right?”
4377 2018-10-04 15:55:25 We both deserve the anointing oil.
4378 2018-10-04 15:55:25 Ivory Coast produces 30 percent of the Cocoa the world consumes, they rake in about 8 billion dollars (2.8 Trillion Naira ) annually.

Before the civil war, Nigeria was the biggest Cocoa producer in the world. 

We abandoned cocoa after the oil boom!
4379 2018-10-04 15:55:18 I have anointing oil please
4380 2018-10-04 15:55:17 Hon'ble Sir , MAMATA BANERJEE   DON'T LESS
OIL VAT. PLEASE PRESIDENT RULES IN WEST BENGAL.
4381 2018-10-04 15:55:16 A story I've not seen covered is the steady rise in oil-by-rail capacity between AB/SK & USA. No @EPA or @environmentca permits required like there is for pplns. With this huge WTI-WCS differential, someone has to be making a killing.

4384 2018-10-04 15:55:09 Rather see teeny tiny wind turbines in the distance than spilled oil and tar on the beach. Andy has always been for big business. He won't care when the water is polluted and the fisheries loose business just as long as the oil companies pay him.
4385 2018-10-04 15:55:07 Hope you’re right. But a huge cabal. Federalist Society & overlapping groups described in the books, which incl descendants of John Birch Society & Nazi/KKK sympathizers (eg KS/OK/TX/oil/gas/media clan, lotsa old & new names in power, evangelical$, centers in Arlington VA).

4392 2018-10-04 15:54:41 Govt. didn't pass the benefit to citizens when crude oil prices were low internationally and kept the prices. Then why are they making excuse of high prices of crude oil internationally now? 
Rs 2.5 cut won't make any much difference.

4397 2018-10-04 15:54:23 No need of any subsidy! Oil companies need not sell less than the cost price! Just reduce excise duty to Rs.9 as it was in 2014!

4400 2018-10-04 15:54:20 @ghanshyamtiwari boasts of his credentials but remains ignorant. Do you know how oil is priced internationally? You should go back to business school and learn how pricing works. So much for your Education.
4401 2018-10-04 15:54:20 This govt was helped by low oil prices far too long, now Voters watching govt cluelessness on  handling it.

Govt should be worried as people"s choice for 2019 is now changed.
4402 2018-10-04 15:54:11 How much u getting the oil for?
4403 2018-10-04 15:54:08 Yes a little on the high side and assuming no more wreckage as oil prices and interest rates do their best to unravel the US

4405 2018-10-04 15:54:00 Perhaps your distaste for cutting grass stems from using a gas mower which requires gas, oil, and constant maintenance? If so, @RYOBIpowertools makes an awesome battery powered mower that is POWAAAAFUUL and easy to maintain.

4407 2018-10-04 15:53:45 It's a predictable increse of oil price due to Trump'spolixy that made sanctions on Iran.

4419 2018-10-04 15:53:02 Exactly what @dreimer28  said: it is like putting oil on the fire. And humanities bashing is a real sport in DK!
4420 2018-10-04 15:52:54 Look at Chtukr media, they are celebrating 2.50₹ cut as if govt has brought Oil at 2014 rate that's - 58₹.
Crossed all limits of Buttering and Licking the a......
4421 2018-10-04 15:52:48 Rate was fine but what was crude oil price that time? What was diesel price ? And what was the tax paid to center?
4422 2018-10-04 15:52:44 Closing prices: #Ftse100 -1.22% #DAX -0.35% #CAC -1.47% #Estoxx50 -0.87% #GBPUSD 1.3025 #EURGBP 0.884 #GILTBUND 113.3 #Gold 0.26% #Oil -1.15%

2ndly Arewa Twitter has never been the most vibrant, y'all fix that or keep whining
4424 2018-10-04 15:52:39 Take note of crude oil even if processing included petrol can be given in 45 only. Then y 90. Crude oil last 5 year me Baha hai to rate down q nahi huye.

4430 2018-10-04 15:51:56 Now it is up to 3 Republican Senators to decide if this FBI investigation gives them enough cover to give them a yes vote, so two can receive money from the RNC next election and the 3rd can get a nice lobbying job with a GOP thinktank or oil company.
4431 2018-10-04 15:51:56 tea tree oil is not for eyebag 
4432 2018-10-04 15:51:55 On May 16,2014, the price of crude oil was $107.09. Present price of crude today is $86. Average crude price during 52 months of Modi Govt is $58/barrel nearly 45% less than UPA tenure.Still Fuel Prices continue to skyrocket at much higher levels during Modi Govt #PetrolChorModi
4433 2018-10-04 15:51:53 Look at the sources you're quoting. You're buying your snake oil directly from the snake. We're leaving the most lucrative trade coalition on earth to pick up the scraps..IF we're lucky to get the scraps. What a joke.
4434 2018-10-04 15:51:49 It's not legal in the Netherlands, you might want to check that out....I use CBD oil for pain relief, but I am in agreement that a cannabis company should not be sponsoring a cycling team, the same as a smoking company cannot sponsor a sports team anymore
4435 2018-10-04 15:51:47 I got my first oil change by myself today, so I think it’s safe to say I can do literally anything now
4436 2018-10-04 15:51:45 Just the opposite.  I support importing goods and medicin and other necessary items. But histiry shows They spend the money to promote their own agenda. I believe there should be an international regulation to import food and medicine in exchage for oil. Not money. Even one cent
4437 2018-10-04 15:51:44 $spx too many headwinds, interest rates, oil prices, labor shortage, tariffs. Oct is the month of crashes

4440 2018-10-04 15:51:42 So true! Coal and crud oil also saved the forests from extinction. My friend who lives off grid recently installed a calcium carbide lighting system which was used in some homes and to light street lamps prior to whale oil.

As for the geology degree, as long as you have some other augmenting specialization to go along with it, like solid computer knowledge, it's still worth it. Alberta still has a bit of an oil industry, and we still explore.
4450 2018-10-04 15:51:03 Moody's pathetic denial about $TSLA production and SEC's cucked punishment shows no one wants to be perceived as a "green energy" company killer that's being controlled by "big oil".

4463 2018-10-04 15:49:57 Import crude oil, process it, and export the refined petrol and diesel.
This is the business of refining units.
Exported petrol was sold in UPA regime at a price, import cost + refining cost.
When NDA  is continuing the same, Why Congress is faulting it now?

No logic.

4489 2018-10-04 15:47:36 of course i got oil on my fucking clothes. i have the worst luck.
4490 2018-10-04 15:47:29 Jeff they wouldn't do it if it weren't effective. Boeing & cost plus aerospace, short sellers & capital media who resent Tesla, Big oil who fight back against solar/battery competition. You bet it's effective.
4491 2018-10-04 15:47:24 But its all political and Corporate hit job on industry to favor lithium over oil although lithium is worse for the environment

4514 2018-10-04 15:45:04 It's a big world out there. A few localized jestures with neighbors who really didn't give up all that much (check it out) is good for propaganda but pretty much original status quo. The US buys oil from Russia btw. And China is known for its patience. Not so for Americans.
4515 2018-10-04 15:44:49 And no, I am not defending the PC neo-cons at all, the last three administrations were disgusting in their spending habits. But at least they did not chase capital out of Alberta. The oil industry in the US and around the world is booming. We committed economic suicide instead.

4520 2018-10-04 15:44:33 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt

4525 2018-10-04 15:44:04 Where was your opinion when government was looting the public selling increased rate of petroleum products instead of lower rate of crude oil in international markets
4526 2018-10-04 15:43:57 - Coconut Oil
Coconut oil is 50% Lauric acid which kills diseases and prevents gingivitis while whitening your teeth

I hope this worked for all of you

4529 2018-10-04 15:43:09 $200B was transferred to the Province of Quebec. That was far larger than what the heritage fund ever held. For that, the mayor of Montreal tried to toss a grenade into our oil and gas business, and Ottawa has been doing their best to stifle us at every step.

4549 2018-10-04 15:41:15 You have no control of oil price .So that cannot save you. And y is the oil price increasing and your foriegn reserve is depleting? Nigeria is in Auto gear to doom if something urgent is not done to refloat this economy. The level of debts are unstainable. We need new leadership
4550 2018-10-04 15:41:09 Ok, what did current govt do for this? They had the luxury to buy oil on $27 per barrel and reported 13 lakh crore income?
4551 2018-10-04 15:41:07 You are the consummate snake oil salesman. The people of West Virginia are weak minded and will buy anything you sell.  If you told them to walk off a cliff they would. Hopefully you will go with them.

4560 2018-10-04 15:40:33 Containers and chemical components will be recycled. They don't get irretrievably consumed, like oil. Be happy. For every EV sold, there will be that much more of the planet's *remaining* oil available for you and your friends. Try to keep up.

I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

4565 2018-10-04 15:40:05 More oil import means more Trade deficit.

Can you share how much electricity does the process consume?

What is the plan for ramping down our dependency on these ancient sunshine resources?

Maybe work on renewable bio sourced replacements for the non-fuel needs.
4569 2018-10-04 15:40:00 Wall Street's Madison Avenue used women as sex objects to sell everything for decades & "Man as the Monster" is their new sales tool. Much like #Science worked hand in hand with oil companies for 134 years & then turned around & blamed the consumer for Climate Change
4570 2018-10-04 15:39:52 Sir why not making a huge public awareness campaign to ride cycle for short distance daily office going, and making electric car to reduce oil imports & least carbon emissions

4581 2018-10-04 15:38:45 I think the word you should have used was “depressive”, as in the economy, oil and gas, farming and ranching! Impressive in a terribly horrific way.
4582 2018-10-04 15:38:36 everyone talks about making sure you get an oil change but no one talks about making sure to get your windshield wipers changed
4583 2018-10-04 15:38:35 Sure, that's what they said to whale oil lamp makers and Blockbuster employees.
4584 2018-10-04 15:38:31 Fuel price increased to 40 Naira around 2001 & Tolu & Olu  (Maintain) sang about it, it was a "disaster" back then.

4592 2018-10-04 15:37:33 Pl jack your memory few months back excise was cut & oil companies were allowed to cut their loses inflicted by economist PM 
So your figure on excise needs correction @sardesairajdeep u also
4593 2018-10-04 15:37:32 Change Zimra rules which r making it difficult for start ups to get in2 import & exports. I mean hw is it possible that 1 wld need a license/permit 4 every commodity. Why don't we have 1 license 4 items falling under food bracket instead of needing 1 4 cooking oil, 1 4 rice etc

4600 2018-10-04 15:37:14 Don't fool yourself my brother,, crude oil only exist in Niger delta. Apart from there nothing in Igbo land exist and remember those with crude oil in the region are not Igbo's think about it.
4601 2018-10-04 15:37:02 Reduction in oil price would lead to concerns on fisc. To maintain fisc expenditure will be required to reduce which means reduction in economic activity and consequently reduction in growth. So where does brent crude go?

4607 2018-10-04 15:36:52 Sée b4 we dont have a record of how much gas we produced or used. We are talking about remittances now because we have records. Exchange rate was $/ 171. When initial subsidy was removed. Oil then at $37. Now $=350. Oil price @ $86. Gov subsidizing close to 300% i think now
4608 2018-10-04 15:36:49 I dont know where people get these ill informed ideas that we dont pollute and why should we change if others arent. Step up to the plate people. We are not wimpy here. We can use our oil but work to slow our use. Why cant people read data. Environment is not a conspiracy

4659 2018-10-04 15:32:52 I agree there I think thats the idea to "smoke them out" but often people like that cant see the forest for the trees we will see how that rolls over. The push on bond yields and these oil prices isnt good for us though either
4660 2018-10-04 15:32:52 thank you! our friend’s German Shepherd was cured from gran mal seizures a week of small doses of cannabis oil We know it’s medicine!!
4661 2018-10-04 15:32:45 Does anyone remember in Dec 2015 Tina Joemat-Pieterson selling off SA’s oil reserves @ $28/barrel when the global price was about $40/barrel? She & her cohorts netted about $15/barrel profit, costing tax payers about R2.1 Billion. @CyrilRamaphosa any comment?
4662 2018-10-04 15:32:42 @chandarana supermarket.yesterday I bought a 2kg cooking oil from your Ngara outlet.the price tag was ksh 355  but I went to pay at the counter the price was 357 ksh.the difference of 2shillings.why  are you doing this?
4663 2018-10-04 15:32:40 I'd saute with water, and then add the earth balance/olive oil/whatever you like at the end.  Cooking in oil often doesn't make a difference with flavor.  After awhile, you'll lose the taste for butter and your palate will have a new normal. Does that help?

4667 2018-10-04 15:32:23 Don’t you think sir that our foreign policy to move more closer to USA affects us badly because USA has banned the Iran to export oil and thus affect us in whole and neither USA is exporter of oil to India at least.

4676 2018-10-04 15:32:01 Trudeau got what he wanted from Notley; the CLP announcement in 2015 that allowed him to point to Alberta as an ally in his plans for a job-killing carbon tax on all Canadians and attack on oil and gas. She's served her purpose to him, selling us out for no benefit to AB #ableg
4677 2018-10-04 15:31:57 in future oil price will increase this mearge reduction of Rs 2.50 will not be benefitted to public you will again fore to increase the price by Rs 3 to Rs 3.50

Selectice concern for tanker traffic - for tankers that move oil out of canada, not for tankers moving in, or across, or for LNG. 
Selective concern for pipelines - oil likes going to terminal but not gas.

4787 2018-10-04 15:25:01 @Tesla @elonmusk Your tech is gold, its disrupting big oil and such, hurting their pockets. Please, i beg you to invest in personal security as the powers that be might get a little froggy.

4792 2018-10-04 15:24:46 Of the potential pipelines available to build TMX was the worst possible  choice. The oil is still going to the US. Energy East or N. Gateway would have got world prices and moved more. A Trudeau face save.
4793 2018-10-04 15:24:34 So inspite of what Blog ji & other assorted mantri jis say all ie oil is not well on the economic front. Ok. On serious note, it's really refreshing to know at least one in this Govt tells it as it is. Problem acknowledged is problem half solved. More power to him!

4801 2018-10-04 15:24:03 So after hitting 91 not out with #Petrol, Modi deducts Rs 2.50 per litre. 
Even in that, Rs 1 per litre will come from the OIL COMPANIES.

Oil company shares tank by 20%

Effectively @narendramodi has spent 10,500 cr on PUBLICITY so MODI can look like GOD #PetrolChorModi
4802 2018-10-04 15:23:47 Oil companies will fall, Will also impact fiscal deficit, not a sound economic decision, no hope for nifty

4806 2018-10-04 15:23:31 Meanwhile, foreign oil supplying sheikhs & oligarchs have a great laugh at our expense. Our WCS is sold to the US at a discount while Eastern Canada's refineries pay WTI world price & BC drivers burn imported gasoline. Canada: where virtue trumps common sense.
4807 2018-10-04 15:23:29 Is it only Indian stock market is falling...answer is no world wide stock market are facing this all due to rising oil prices and US China trade war. Ups and down are integral part of stock market. Stock market is not end of the world. Trade smartly.   #sensex #nifty

4815 2018-10-04 15:22:53 Its Common sense may be u don’t get it. Oil prices are no longer controlled and the same time any sensible government will not budge for pressure from media or opposition. Will only interefere when it thinks necessary.

4820 2018-10-04 15:22:38 Oil price should cut at least 10 rupees gradually for stable mode
4821 2018-10-04 15:22:36 When I was a kid we had a DeSoto named Shasta Baby: "Shasta have oil....shasta have gas...."  Then we had a Pontiac named "Lornie" for "Lawn Ornament".  Unless "That Fiberglass Piece of Sh*t Your Mother Drives" counts as a name (for my mom's 1st Oldsmobile), no others had names.
4822 2018-10-04 15:22:32 Had to go to Fayetteville to get this haircut and oil change 
4823 2018-10-04 15:22:30 i'm just speculating here, but i believe subsidies are there for a reason. flying only contributes 5% of co2, but i suspect jet fuel is a huge prop to the oil companies. this is kind of metaphysical, but take away props, and things fall down, catastrophically.
4824 2018-10-04 15:22:29 Good question because ours is currently almost an hour delayed due to an oil leak.

4830 2018-10-04 15:22:00 Ah, but do you know what he is referring to? Under the Inquisition, you were guilty unless you could prove your innocence by withstanding such 'proofs' as trial by fire, being dunked in hot oil, etc.
4831 2018-10-04 15:21:48 Obama increased employment in the service sector. Trump has increased employment in manufacturing, mining, and oil. Who makes more, a barista or a machinist? Trump's jobs are high paying jobs.
4832 2018-10-04 15:21:46 Obviously it's Trump policy which increased oil price & it  could make it up to 100$. At least under Obama mandate it was as low as 30$.

4837 2018-10-04 15:21:09 Yeah I don’t know how that all works.  I do know that essential oil diffusers are used to put fragrant mist into the air and that is obviously inhaled. It seems if it were a water base with healing ingredients that would be absorbed by the body, it could actually be beneficial.

4841 2018-10-04 15:20:50 The price is often lower in the summer when there is less demand. Also, since July the cost of crude oil has risen on the glabal market, gradually pushing up the price we pay for kerosene. The exchange rate is also possibly a factor.
4842 2018-10-04 15:20:46 'The Gulf states of the 21st century are more assertive, more confident, the are not only oil reliant and their monarchies have been much more resilient than commentators had anticipated' @Abdulkhaleq_UAE #LSEGulfMoment

4844 2018-10-04 15:20:39 This is the key to engaging the oil&gas companies who are crucial to not impeding the required change.

CO2 re-cycling is the 'gateway drug' to enable this to happen.

4848 2018-10-04 15:20:09 To recover $21 trillion debt through interest : US needs to grow 5% and have a prime lending rate increase up to 7-8% . Thats a paradox plain and simple. Or we should just drill and burn 5-10 years worth of crude oil to fake growth.
4849 2018-10-04 15:20:09 Mataji 
Nature don't give us petrol or diesel directly
it gives us 'Kaccha Oil' then it goes to refineries for separating impurities so Indian refineries are just refining the Kaccha oil & charging for that 

I wish there would be refineries for you people also

4855 2018-10-04 15:19:51 Eisenhower's administration helped remove Mossadegh from Iran to protect private oil interests in Operation Ajax & as a result more power was consolidated in the Shah. We are still dealing with the blowback of that to the present day. Pompeo yesterday removed the U.S. from a 1955

Earlier today, FM Arun Jaitley announced a cut in excise duty of petrol prices by Rs 1.50 and another Re 1 drop by oil marketing companies, taking the cut in fuel prices to Rs 2.50.
4922 2018-10-04 15:14:05 What is the increase in Excise and oil co's profit since 2014 should be made transparent by govt. this reduction prima facie is only due to elections 2019.

4949 2018-10-04 15:11:35 Oil prices may be pulling back, but the oil producers on my watch list aren't. That tells you what you need to know. Oil refiners are taking a hit, which is a shame. Odd day, we'll see if we can turn it to opportunity.

5057 2018-10-04 15:02:29 #PetrolChorModi At a time when international crude oil prices have been CUT by 21$ per barrel, the center continues to LOOT and EXPLOIT the common citizen with such heavy fuel prices.
5058 2018-10-04 15:02:26 The rising world oil prices may be one of the causes for the historic slide in the value of Rupee vi-a-vis dollar. But the major fact has been that 'India's export competitiveness over the last 4 and 1/2 years of Modi rule has taken a major slide'.

5061 2018-10-04 15:02:09 Oil should be rs 28 a litre ( converting 90 a barrel to rs)
5062 2018-10-04 15:02:09 Yes this is the senator who recently thought you had to pay to visit CVNP, so.... We listen to your votes not your words. And you are for more fossil fuel extraction from our national parks. You care about big oil, not our the health of our Parks.

5064 2018-10-04 15:02:08 It's immaterial how much amount the oil prices have been reduced by the Government. As it is integrated with global market,  we have to bear the brunt. So,  it is the policy. So long we embrace the policy,  no other option r there.
5065 2018-10-04 15:02:06 This is good but does not squarely lay the blame where it truly belongs. Oil companies and the millions they spent on disinformation and spreading doubt. Even going so far as paying scientists to lie.
5066 2018-10-04 15:02:05 I don't understand why we can't fix excise duty at the time of yearly budget,  on Petrol and Diesel , like other commodities?  If it happens,  oil companies will be free and transparency will be there.

5068 2018-10-04 15:01:59 The Left media is corrupt and complicit. Many fake left people were at STanding Rock profiting off of standing Rock and fucking over the protesters and others at Standing rock as they helped out the FBI, the oil company, the local police and possibly the CIA.
5069 2018-10-04 15:01:54 #HeatingOil prices seem to be going up sharply at the moment. Anyone know why? What's the outlook?

5100 2018-10-04 14:59:14 Will you also take into consideration, the amount of subsidy that previous govt gave leaving high inflation, high fiscal deficit etc, the OMCs which went into sick units, the oil bill they left when leaving the govt?
Or just 10-20 increase in prices gave you heart burn?.

In fact, you couldn't pay me to go back! They are safer, quieter, cleaner, quicker, and WAY more fun. And 0 oil changes.

5130 2018-10-04 14:57:24 The filling station example is also wrong cause fuel is price controlled.increase or decrease the cost to service stations and oil.companies is covered.Fuel is also a homogenous product.
Alcohol is heterogenous..

5131 2018-10-04 14:57:23 i think renewable roi will grow greatly. remember, oil used to just fall out of motorcycles, and wasn't reused even once. also, i am in favor of ren eng plus nukes with heavy research into fusion.
5132 2018-10-04 14:57:15 This morning while getting an oil change, the guy asked me to get er up to 2000rpm. But me being me, gets nervous that this guy is watching me and I literally pushed the brake instead of the gas... i can never return here.

5160 2018-10-04 14:54:10 I have a 2013 Boxster (albeit with only around 24,000 miles). It has needed absolutely nothing except an annual oil change & (optional) bi-annual brake fluid flush, plus an alignment when I ran over a curb. Any Tesla is horrendously worse than any new car but maybe an Alfa Romeo.

5162 2018-10-04 14:54:04 They have to get it from us somehow. I did see a program on cars with self charging batteries (solar power roofs) not powerful enough yet but with technology hopefully all cars will be self powering. But the oil cartels are holding that back.

5189 2018-10-04 14:52:17 heh, Iran knows the Syria situation is so insane it doesn't bother hiding its oil shipments.

5191 2018-10-04 14:52:00 The left and religion = oil and water
5192 2018-10-04 14:51:57 Do they still even make those. Eish mukwa oil. Had forgotten that, kuno yangove Mr Min pazvese wangu
5193 2018-10-04 14:51:55 That money comes and goes, according to the world price of oil.  Coal is pretty much going the way of the VHS tape, regardless of what the president says.

5195 2018-10-04 14:51:51 I appreciate when people share products they use about their everyday lives no matter how random (type of oil they use, toothpaste, Starbucks order, fav hummus etc.) like yes girl tell me the intricate details about which rice cake you like more coz I like apple cinnamon!!!

5208 2018-10-04 14:50:46 ไม่อยากทะ
5209 2018-10-04 14:50:46 Looks like we are going to war with Russia, Iran, and maybe even China. This seems like a rerun we all saw back in 2001 with Iraq. There must be some oil somewhere that someone is not sharing.
5210 2018-10-04 14:50:46 Oil PSUs take a hit again!!! Back to subsidies on petrol and diesel. Sad day for reforms
5211 2018-10-04 14:50:41 Pakistan economy is in deep trouble, dwindling forex reserves, CPEC mess, IMF issues, huge debt, power shortages, rising crude , surging US$, Saudi UTurn on Oil, ....
5212 2018-10-04 14:50:39 Oil and water doesn't mix. Neither does MESSY and ANOINTED...

5218 2018-10-04 14:50:06 Det de ønsker er å fjerne ordet ‘stat’, akkurat som med ‘stat’oil. Dermed usynliggjøres fellesskapets eierforhold til virksomheten, og konkurranseutsetting og privatisering kan gjennomføres med mindre motstand. Språk er makt.

5222 2018-10-04 14:49:54 ?
5223 2018-10-04 14:49:41 It does, yes .. you can gargle it . Mix with salt water .. if it’s pure you need to mix with coconut oil or olive oil too .. also use a few drops under tongue couple times daily to fight infection during times with cold or flu symptoms
5224 2018-10-04 14:49:37 So, Re. 1 per ltr is to be borne by OMCs, that comes to around Rs. 74,56,51,690 per day.. all this while the govt was harping on the fact that it was because of the oil bonds that they have to increase the rates. Now what about this loss to the OMCs. Afterall they are PSUs
5225 2018-10-04 14:49:37 Damn my dreams are boring sometimes lol. I had a dream last night that I was getting an oil change and new break pads for my truck 
5226 2018-10-04 14:49:31 Usually the USD would be falling by now softening the blow of higher oil but rates, oil exports, stocks rally changed things, for now
5227 2018-10-04 14:49:26 Everyone has what they like. There's oil in the stew, oil in the shito. How much oil again.

5230 2018-10-04 14:49:01 finally getting an oil change!!! my life is on the come up fr lol
5231 2018-10-04 14:48:57 No. Not awesome. An oil painting by somebody like Caravaggio is awesome.
5232 2018-10-04 14:48:57 12K dairy farmers across Canada, less than 1% GDP. Milk is just as expensive as gas at the pumps. We always cry foul about big oil companies price fixing, but why never about the milk cartel??
5233 2018-10-04 14:48:49 Sana oil may suvaaaa
5234 2018-10-04 14:48:48 Does 8b$ require for establishing oil refinery ?
5235 2018-10-04 14:48:48 Aaaaah it is olive oil.
5236 2018-10-04 14:48:40 Make me understand this: after fuel prices go up by 20 Rs, they get cut by Rs 2 and we ‘celebrate’? What happens now if oil crosses $100 a barrel? Is fuel state controlled or market driven or festival/election driven? #Petrol
5237 2018-10-04 14:48:34 I need a hot oil treatment 
5238 2018-10-04 14:48:29 Look at the thumping AB oil takes every day on the world market and the massive job losses because of no pipelines and suddenly 12,000 heavily subsidized Eastern dairy farmers are a problem?
5239 2018-10-04 14:48:23 Ba't ang hyper ko, di naman puro sweets kinain ko, puro oil nga e.
5240 2018-10-04 14:48:19 Having a mutilfaceted transport  system where you can have different substances with different properties, like crude oil, jet fuel, and diesel or other refined products, flowing is a good proposal especially if it makes it to new terrain.

5244 2018-10-04 14:47:57 Dammit, my age-ist jab was ruined by autocorrect!

Anyway, I'm sure gigantic oil supply shocks *do* cause recessions in oil-dependent economies, but that this doesn't describe much of the business cycle we observe in the world...
5245 2018-10-04 14:47:55 The devil lie in detail.. only excerpt good for propaganda don't tell the whole story... oil imports are not new problem but with each rise in price the problem is balloning up.. but is respite in coming via some policy led decision like tax ethanol better technology vehicles
5246 2018-10-04 14:47:51 Ice cold water, peppermint candy or oil diffusing
5247 2018-10-04 14:47:49 I don't see it that way. The industrial revolution improved humanity's lot, and fossil fuels were the driving force - replacing things like whale oil and biomass. Most of the so-called subsidies for FF apply to consumers rather than producers. I.e. they address energy poverty
5248 2018-10-04 14:47:49 took my cue from oil
5249 2018-10-04 14:47:48 U.S. using ~20MM barrels of oil/day. U.S. producing ~11MM barrels a day. Reducing consumption by 9MM barrels/day (via solar) helps mitigate AGW and boosts military strength, U.S. security by eliminating oil imports from countries who dont like us. @MichaelEMann @realDonaldTrump

5257 2018-10-04 14:46:51 Just imagine what will the price of petrol in india when crude oil reach $100 per barrel? Manmohan was selling at ₹70 when it was $107.

5264 2018-10-04 14:46:20 @ForecasterEnten Saw your appearance on CNN a few minutes ago. Stats are stats, polls are polls, but what most miss with Trump is that most people especially those on the fence won't publicly admit to anyone, especially pollsters, that they are voting in Trump's direction.
5265 2018-10-04 14:46:18 Now states ruled by opposition should cut prices by Rs 1.5 and ask the oil Marketing companies to absorb another Rs 1 on behalf of states !!!! @Naveen_Odisha
5266 2018-10-04 14:46:11 #CL $USO $CL $OIL #OOTT. Oil falling and soon bonds are gonna be bid./Shorts will partially cover as they will refuse to go into NFP after such a sell off.

5268 2018-10-04 14:46:09 Check your Transmission oil today.
5269 2018-10-04 14:46:02 No doubt, but the timetable of all those things was also "not exactly being made public" either. For me, the death-knell was a manifesto pledge not to increase taxation. That could never have been sustained as oil prices plummeted.
5270 2018-10-04 14:45:55 So I’m gifting everyone grapeseed oil for Christmas and birthdays because my hair and skin is blessed
5271 2018-10-04 14:45:55 Is it true that use Monster drinks to clean an oil in the stuff off of their chains and motors
5272 2018-10-04 14:45:54 It seems your skin type is combination but I really recommend rose hip oil for the dryness/flakiness
5273 2018-10-04 14:45:53 XLE unch with this market pressure and oil down is impressive.
5274 2018-10-04 14:45:40 Natural gas can't replace crude oil. Extensive salt layers with large oil reserves underneath are rare @bentir @staunovo
5275 2018-10-04 14:45:36 @rahulgandhi UPA issued oil bonds against increase in oil prices, but did not make payment. So Modi Govt had to pay 1.5L Crores (basic payment) + 70K Crores for interest. This is one of the reasons for $ value.
5276 2018-10-04 14:45:31 He forgot about the Trump tweet ceiling on oil
5277 2018-10-04 14:45:23 I don't support Brexit, but anyone that does, should support full devolution and independence. And the oil goes with Scotland. Personally, I want, continue to support and have served the union. It's heartbreaking to see how truly shabby it's turning out to be.
5278 2018-10-04 14:45:22 why tf everyone wanna get their oil changed today smh I’m not waiting over two fucking hours 
5279 2018-10-04 14:45:05 @dpradhanbjp put up notices on petrol bunks that requests people to avoid filling "Full Tank". Will save oil wasted through evaporation.

5292 2018-10-04 14:44:09 The thing is not having lights is bad. Only getting light oil (conventional light or pentane plus) is not going to supplant the heavy oil we need for homes and vehicles, not sure what aircraft at airports used for fuel.

5295 2018-10-04 14:44:01 i feel like some tech can ameliorate this. like switching oil from a fuel econ to a plastics econ that is recycled; renewable and nuke energy. it does feel like we're at the end of an era.

Why such a decision and when there is no hope that the  price may not continue the rising trend in coming days. Please remove the confusion.Thanks for the decision
5301 2018-10-04 14:43:23 Another instance of insider trading by some in Finance Ministry .

They announced cut of revenue on oil companies 15 minutes before market closing.  Why not at 3.30

Coz they sold these in futures and made huge money. Nifty went down to 300 points

5313 2018-10-04 14:42:26 When UPA was in power the price of Petrol was less than 75 even when global crude oil touched 108$ a barrel. Today the price of crude is around 80 but NDA is charging petrol at 90₹

You put a little bit of oil, just enough to kind of cover the bottom, then you put whatever amount of garlic you want, then enough rice to please your hunger 
You sort of fry it, and add some salt, then water (1 1/2 to 2 fingers) above rice level

NIFTY was gasping at tht time & it breathed its last after tht. Ppl thought they cud save around 400 rs/month bt also invested in oil companies, say 1 lac, lost 20k in no time

5323 2018-10-04 14:41:24 The price of gasoline has little to do with who sits as president. It has more to do with the economic And political situation of countries that produce crude oil. It has only a very little thing to do with the Philippines.

5326 2018-10-04 14:40:48 India is and will always be a democracy and not a puppet in the hands of any other country. 
US wants India to stop buying oil from Iran defense equipments from Russia and moreover buy everything from US. What about India's interests?
Has ever US tried to address that?

5338 2018-10-04 14:40:16 Snake oil is a derogatory against healing salves which derives from the Egyptian usage of crocodile fat. Generally used to refer to fake the term is also abused to refer to suppressed religions such as snake medicine of Goddess ISIS whose symbol of wisdom is the snake.

5350 2018-10-04 14:39:33 The combination of soaring bond yields and rising oil is a solid reflection of broadening global growth and liquidity.  If bond bears push their short positions further, EM outflows will be even further accelerated.
5351 2018-10-04 14:39:31 Elections gimmick. Oil prices increased by ₹ 20-25 in last one year. Now being reduced by only ₹ 2.50. FM is not on test, only state Govts are. Logical ?

Narrative is Target specific!
5364 2018-10-04 14:38:28 Yes we should. Botswana pays R10/l and they buy their juice from us. My only point was the critical petrol price indicators 1) price of brent crude oil 2) we pay in dollar for bco will be uneffected by owning a refinery AND Gov has no expertise to run it (eg ESKOM, SAA, etc)

5375 2018-10-04 14:38:04 Current car manufacture requires oil. The net consumption would decrease. #BEV last longer decreasing  replacement demand. Electricity produced in modern power plants is more efficient than ICE engines any day.

• Saudi Arabia, Russia agreed in Sept to lift oil output, told U.S.
• U.S. VP Pence to tell China: We will not be intimidated in South China Sea

5469 2018-10-04 14:31:20 Before May 2014, the poor welfare schemes were funded by loans taken by World Bank, so the Government need not require to increase the tax on oil.

Re 1/l to be absorbed by OMCs

More than 42-50000 cr market cap of oil companies wiped out for saving 7000 cr fiscal deficit. 

This is long term wealth erosion for annual fiscal adjustment

5520 2018-10-04 14:28:42 I agree dynamics are changing now that US imports less and ECB less inflation-phobic.  Nevertheless, I'm not convinced positive EUR/oil correlation is dead because on balance it seems petrostate surpluses (Russia/MiddleEast) always force dollars into European assets.

5556 2018-10-04 14:25:57 Idea of free pricing of oil was to be able to create an image that OMCs are independent . Govt would have been able to divest their stakes at high price. Congress had bankrupted the OMCs . Sad politics is above all

Rohrbacher.

@HarleyRouda can win...it takes people willing to canvass. 

Get out there and help if you can!!

5592 2018-10-04 14:23:32 Whilst elsewhere in Scotland can aspire to move towards a Shetland approach to oil, the Zetland County Council Act 1974 came about due to specific reasons which can't be replicated across other industries and council areas/island communities under the current system.

Check it out, natural healing is better also Wheatgrass.
5606 2018-10-04 14:22:21 At a time when international crude oil prices have been CUT by 21$ per barrel, the center continues to LOOT and EXPLOIT the common citizen with such heavy fuel prices. But the people of India are much smarter than this. They won't be fooled by BJPs silly tricks.

I'd holdup 1 more day for newly wed sex too.

5620 2018-10-04 14:20:55 You are confusing shock with propagation mechanism. In any case, note that, oil price shock in an RBC model where oil is an intermediate input generates outcome that looks like a negative TFP shock. Oil shocks have played a big role in U.S. recessions.
5621 2018-10-04 14:20:53 US is still net importer of oil, also, you can't switch refineries between gulf oil and shale oil over night.
5622 2018-10-04 14:20:40 @AmitShah  U decreased the tax. Not the oil price. It's will be today's price in less than a month. Don't think u can fool everybody like ur bakths.

5627 2018-10-04 14:19:53 The arab world was simply incapable of extracting their own GDP to begin with.   You relied on American ingenuity and manufacturing to discover their oil, drill their oil, transport their oil and refine their oil.

5629 2018-10-04 14:19:48 There is still the “turn off the tap” legislation that @RachelNotley brought in earlier this year. At some point that card needs to be played to let @jjhorgan know what happens when the flow of oil to B.C. stops.
5630 2018-10-04 14:19:29 Hate to be the one teaching you on this.  
-We buy more, rupees weakens it cost more.
-Price crosses $100, rupee weakens, it costs more. 
We produce more goods or we buy less oil.  
Solution: Keep price high to reduce consumption.
5631 2018-10-04 14:19:21 You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
5632 2018-10-04 14:19:14 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

5656 2018-10-04 14:18:03 Historically oil prices have been more predictive of $EURUSD than US-EU rate differentials.  I think EUR is just held up by the force of its external surpluses & the fact, as @BisphamGreen suggested, that many euro FI investors have already massively gone for carry in the US.

5714 2018-10-04 14:12:28 Did you know that regular maintenance like oil changes can help keep you safe while you drive? The maintenance will make sure that your car is running well, and give your mechanics a chance to check belts, hoses, and other parts for wear.

5716 2018-10-04 14:12:22 So, after personally taking the CBD oil for a few months now, I can sincerely say I have less pain throughout my body and sleep is so much better. Those are just a few of the things Hempworx has done for my health and life. If your curious what it can do for you too, take a look.
5717 2018-10-04 14:12:12 Indian economy is getting whipped by oil price rise triggered by expected effect of USA's Iran sanctions. Hopefully there won't be any permenant damage or any damage will be offset by real gains?

5720 2018-10-04 14:12:02 Happy to hear centre is reducing 2.5 rupee on oil price. This will encourage now all remaining states to reduce as well.
5721 2018-10-04 14:11:54 One time effect ba kamo ang excise tax sa oil under train law? Tanga ka nga talaga. Sa 2019 magiging 9php per liter na. Sa 2020 magiging 10php per liter na ang magiging increase. Magresearch ka pa dds.
5722 2018-10-04 14:11:52 At a time when international crude oil prices have been CUT by 21$ per barrel, the center continues to LOOT and EXPLOIT the common citizen with such heavy fuel prices. But the people of India are much smarter than this. They won't be fooled by BJPs silly tricks.

5732 2018-10-04 14:11:27 My worst fear have come true. Govt reintroduces fuel subsidy at Rs1/ltr. 
The fear is any spike in oil prices from here would lead to even higher subsidies. Populist measures will take the precedent in an election heavy season.
5733 2018-10-04 14:11:19 One could argue there's more an upside under Trump/Iran than Obama/Iran because of his (seemingly) more aggressive stance putting lower odds on Iran's oil flow coming back soon unsanctioned.

5737 2018-10-04 14:10:54 @ArvindKejriwal - Central govt has cut down taxes by 1.5 RS and has asked Oil companies to reduce their margin by 1 rs. Various state government has announced vat cut namely J&K govt, Assam Govt, MP Govt. It's your turn to act. Curious to see what you'll do for Delhi now

The road cess, which entirely goes to the central govt has not been cut. Out of the Rs 2.5 cut, Rs 1 is to be borne by oil PSUs. Out of the remaining 1.5, 42% ie Rs 0.63 is borne by all states together... 1/2

5843 2018-10-04 14:02:15 High crude oil prices along with rupee depreciation also dampened investors sentiments.  Sensex and Nifty ended 2.24% and 2.39% lower respectively.

5846 2018-10-04 14:02:02 I thought that Surjewala was on a diet of castor oil, but, it seems that he is now on a diet of diesel and petrol. My recommendation is that he should switch over to kerosene.
5847 2018-10-04 14:02:01 The one rupee government has forced oil companies to absorb would have cost the government 7500 crores in lost revenues; the loss in market cap for OMCs is 40000 crores. And will make people more squeamish about investing in PSUs. Genius country; genius government.
5848 2018-10-04 14:01:56 Proud of myself for trying for something i never thought i would do before this. WOOOOO!!!!! Bak kata papa “this is the first of many elections”. Yall know who your future Oil and Gas CEO is  Haters will say its impossible. Inshaallah

5852 2018-10-04 14:01:38 Yes, it was a the wors deal ever. Iran was 2 years short of reaching nuclear power. With our deal that timline was moved to 15 years. No nuclear power and in exchange we lift the oil ban. Oil price dropped, our gas prices went down. Now, Iran is back on track for nuclrear power

5859 2018-10-04 14:01:16 @CMOMaharashtra the government could have used the tax money to construct more skywalks and buy more buses rather than reduce petrol tax. Since this reduction will get covered up by the rising crude oil rates. So the benefit will be short term.
5860 2018-10-04 14:01:09 So if that is JT's opinion why doesn't he stand up to these Middle East counties. Maybe block the import of their oil. #ourpmisabitch

5875 2018-10-04 14:00:02 As I wrote earlier this year, the oil marketing companies are back to subsidising petrol and diesel prices.
The more things change, the more they remain the same.
On the economic front BJP or Congress, are basically the same. 
They just love the Big Government.
5876 2018-10-04 13:59:57 Going to the gas station with my dad was a treat. He went to the same station every time and the owner, Pat (who also pumped the gas, checked the oil and washed the windows) always gave us kids a soda.

5881 2018-10-04 13:59:09 Looks like we are going to war with Russia, Iran, and maybe even China. This seems like a rerun we all saw back in 2001 with Iraq. There must be some oil somewhere that someone is not sharing.

Apparently government does not have control over oil prices, right? So,how did @arunjaitley manage to get the oil companies to reduce the price? Citizens are not fools!
All lies failed and even Sanghi  heads realise they are up to their nose in . It's stinking.

5905 2018-10-04 13:56:06 Tell me, we always knew oil was our weak point; it would time & again, throw our economy out of gear; then why for God's sake, Congress didn't since 1970s, invest heavily in research & development of alternative energy resources for India?
Can you tell me why?

5972 2018-10-04 13:50:00 Thanks for the clarification regarding LNG. You're right, its not oil. That said, I'm still concerned because it is a fossil fuel and does contribute to climate change. China has nothing to do with this discussion. I'm a Canadian citizen questioning the decisions of the GoC.

5976 2018-10-04 13:49:42 Increasing oil prices!!! Why people worry about it? One can spend 500₹ or more on pizza or anything else without thinking a little bit about their pockets. Isn’t it true?
5977 2018-10-04 13:49:38 The logical part is, that when price increases it is actually because of global crude oil price increase. But when now it is being decreased by GOI it is from the government's tax. So effectively government was not increasing the price but indeed they are decreasing

5991 2018-10-04 13:48:56 As it happens the IEA reckons Indian oil products have some of the biggest subsidies after Venezuela, Saudi and China...mainly iirc for LPG after diesel and petrol were deregulated.

What tax takes away, support for the OMCs gives back.

6090 2018-10-04 13:41:11 I think the issue is that the prices increased, despite Modi's lucky ride on cheap oil, by ₹14 since 2013, when had actually promised cheaper petrol in his campaign. The reduction offered is ₹5 (in MH), effective price has still INCREASED by ₹11.5. So the outrage.

6117 2018-10-04 13:38:51 Thus far it has defeated  its purpose - funding nations   that  are  opening up new oil and gas  exploration - they should not be  quilified   for such - double standard - lacks transparency

Any body heard of shale oil.

It was agreed that USD 80/- is ideal price.

USD 40/- is just break even- all oil pruducing countries had tough time n went bankrupt.

Modi Govt minted money for last 3y, the prices in India hardly reduced.

6137 2018-10-04 13:37:00 Thank OPEC. In late 2014, they decided to begin all-out producing oil, a policy which ended in late 2016, and since then, lower oil production has caused supply to drop and thus higher prices. Iran situation adds maybe 5-10c/gal, most of the 42c/gal rise vs yr ago is OPEC.

6252 2018-10-04 13:27:13 It's being currently driven only on funds.  Physical not much demand.  As  freights haven't moved and the baseoils as well. Given dollar strength assets might switch to usd n ease pressure on oil.

6272 2018-10-04 13:25:02 Worth noting: We did get some things from the US in the USMCA. The most important is that we regained sovereignty over our oil. The second most important is that we regained sovereignty over our laws and eliminated most of the ISDS.
6273 2018-10-04 13:25:02 Entire burden is not on OMC. This burden is minuscule compared to the times when they were bleeding due to Subsidy etc. Oil Bonds was a losing idea
6274 2018-10-04 13:24:57 The point I brought up was meant to show the fallacy in the use of increased subsidies to dampen our expectations for improved performance in democracy dividend delivery on the back of increased revenue earnings from oil.
6275 2018-10-04 13:24:55 OIL 1H caution here as volatility impulse appears to SPLIT, spike higher on 15M just now. As markets open there may be a move higher here. 1D chart looks very bullish. WATCH

6305 2018-10-04 13:22:03 You are confused between subsidies and oil bonds. Oil bonds are issued and paid on maturity. This govt need no lessons from UPA economist who take the inflation to ~15% and GDP to 4.5%.  This govt is doing fine enough in maintaining the inflation below 5%.

6327 2018-10-04 13:21:01 During UPA time, the inflation was high and hence they had to issue oil bonds to control petrol prices, which was not wrong. They did what was right and NDA is doing what is right

6346 2018-10-04 13:19:22 FYI, the govt cleared 2 lac crore oil bonds from previous govt. Let’s not look at political views here, but what is good for the country. Higher oil prices at lower inflation is not bad for economy. Each individual pays Rs.200-600 extra per month, but most other prices are down
6347 2018-10-04 13:19:22 An 8.0 mb in crude #oil yesterday was no match for the bulls.  Not sure why they are shocked - so many traders have an estimated a loss of 1.8 mbpd of refinery capacity due to planned maintenance in October. #OOTT

6406 2018-10-04 13:13:38 - the exchange rate has been devalued significantly, the price of oil is north of $80 a barrel today and therefore, the landing cost cannot be the same. We need transparency on this issue, government has to come out clean...

6484 2018-10-04 13:07:09 I'm saying it's irrelevant if they are literally buying Russian gas or someone else's gas. Commodity markets don't care since oil and gas are fungible. The Russians will sell to someone and get the same price, and the Germans will buy from someone and pay the same price.

6522 2018-10-04 13:04:54 I guess it's not just about the tariffs, but they also want to diversify away from the USD - so taking oil from other sources that will sell for CNY is a better long term option.

Hell with your half baked comments.
Rupee value falling against dollars and petrol price rise is a result of multiple elements interaction not just crude oil price.

6535 2018-10-04 13:04:04 Dear Amithshaji your finance minister and government as a whole has insulted the common man by reducing oil prices by 2 rupees. Do you think we the people of   India is so cheap and vote for you for another tenure? Your party is going to face a very humiliating defeat .

6550 2018-10-04 13:02:48 The taxes had to be increased because the previous government had kept huge crude oil debt for the present government to pay. How would have the government paid it and clear the debt if it hadn't increased the price ? Use some common sense.

6554 2018-10-04 13:02:33 Govt. has reduced excise duty of Rs.1.50, persuaded oil companies to also reduce Rs.1 & appealed state Govt to reduce Rs.2.50, so as to cut fuel cost by Rs.5 per liter. GST council should bring fuels under GST.

6556 2018-10-04 13:02:25 Gas oil is red in color to tell it apart from other diesel fuels. It is designed for special uses. The fuel is cheaper than un-dyed fuel to provide a tax break to those in specific industries in the UK. Misuse of gas oil is a crime and there are heavy penalties involved.

6562 2018-10-04 13:01:58 I got to know today from @arunjaitley ji that state govt is earning revenue with oil prices on ad valorem basis (on % basis). It means all states are in better position with increase in Oil prices & still some of them are blaming @BJP4India for such price hike. #FuelPriceCut
6563 2018-10-04 13:01:47 Then you’ve been arguing the wrong point my friend. I was talking about gov decisions as to WHO they buy oil from. Merkel condemns Russia yet jumps in bed with them. Buying their gas. And then says we are a bad ally?!

6580 2018-10-04 13:00:47 And sanctions do have an impact, you are correct there. The sanctions on the Iranians have taken their supply out of the market, which is driving up oil prices. So yes, we are hurting the Iranians, but we are hurting ourselves as well.

If Union government cut ₹1 on petrol at the same time they have to face some 12,000 crore revenue loss.
Ultimately that steps is not good as for as developing Country like India is concerned.

6606 2018-10-04 12:57:52 10 days max. Either rupee will keep falling or oil will keep rising or both. It is a solution that is definitely not going to work.

FM should have thought about this before fudging the GDP numbers and before making a budget assuming oil price of $55. Now it is too late.

6613 2018-10-04 12:57:27 Two months back when people complained to revert excise imposed by JAITLEY oil companies mocked consumers by reducing price of petrol by one Paise after rise of Rs 8/ litre. Even after that price went up more than Rs 20 & now today FM giving relief of Rs 1.5. Consumers shocked.

6618 2018-10-04 12:56:36 I don’t need to have good memory. I am not writing UPSC. Regarding the petrol price, kindly check the barrel price of crude oil from May to December 2014. It was bound to decrease.

6620 2018-10-04 12:56:16 That's not what I said at all. Only the producers of oil get the profits, but the consumers of oil all pay roughly the same price since all oil consumers are drawing out of the same pot that oil producers are dumping their product into. All commodities work like this.

6633 2018-10-04 12:54:53 Fuel prices have increased by 25% since 2009 and  this gives a greater VAT yield and in addition VAT has risen from 15% to 20% so the chancellor has not really been short changed. Any oil price increase brings the exchequer additional revenue.

6654 2018-10-04 12:52:36 We should try to avoid use of personal vehicles....try to use public transport...as demand of crude oil is getting increase resulting in high petrol prices...small step can make good diff..@narendramodi @PiyushGoyal @arunjaitley @Dev_Fadnavis
6655 2018-10-04 12:52:36 omg true i’m gonna attempt sunflower oil on my face can’t wait i’ll let u know outcome x
6656 2018-10-04 12:52:34 Another option to make your own is to buy the distillate Crystals and mix with appropriate oil. I personally use hemp oil and make 10% formula. I am very passionate about medical marijuana and pretty much spend a majority of my free time learning about it.
6657 2018-10-04 12:52:32 Becsuse gov had to pay 2 lakh Crores pending oil bills which previous gov did not pay though they collected money from people, but you will not ask them where that money went, but you will question current gov on economic crisis. Neutral journalist ?
6658 2018-10-04 12:52:22 For OPEC countries to survive and for folks to invest in energy sectors, oil price needs to sustainably high. Go back and read your own statements when oil prices were low and investment tumbled.

6660 2018-10-04 12:52:19 I am clear about the price mechanism of Petrol/Crude oil related products. India doesn't have enough recoverable geological oil/gas reserves & hence She has to depend on importation. Price of imported crude oil can not be controlled by GOI hence price rise impacts domestic prices
6661 2018-10-04 12:52:18 @ZeeNewsBihar  bihar m kitna ghataya gya price oil ka k9i update nhi de rhe h bihar ka aap log
6662 2018-10-04 12:52:15 there’s an oil spill right at the 95 ramp, all the roads are closed, there’s like an hour delay in traffic and i have to be at work by 10.  my managers response, “wow that’s crazy”
6663 2018-10-04 12:52:02 Trying to cut down on the ecological impact of what I eat and drink, so went for the oat milk based coffee.
Just clocked that it's full of rapeseed oil?! Gross. Gross. Gross.
6664 2018-10-04 12:52:01 Have u heard of the Oil bonds? If Govt wants to be populist  it can sell oil at Rs 50 from tomorrow taking money by selling some bonds like the great MMS did. It is fiscal prudence or populism.
6665 2018-10-04 12:51:59 Had kar diya opposition walo ne, oil ka dam badhe to bhe paresane ghate to bhe, akheer ye chahte kya hain.
6666 2018-10-04 12:51:55 u could try something else oil based i used olive oil for pink facepaint once and it worked x
6667 2018-10-04 12:51:54 Trerrible idea. Time to move on to renewables. Oil and gas are filthy fossil fuels that are destroying our environment. Renewables create more jobs and don’t threaten our oceans and coastlines. No more dirty fossil fuels.

6672 2018-10-04 12:51:15 @fiat @FIAT_UK please can you explain your logic. Just took car for first service. Fiat “demand” that if car has done LESS than 10,000km the oil and filter need changing at £98. But if over 10,000km no oil change needed. Opposite to any logic.

6684 2018-10-04 12:50:21 Thanking for Rs.2.5 cut ? They have been looting us since 2014 , the very same people who wanted UPA to reduce fuel prices when oil was at USD 140/Barrel .What comes to mind is the cap seller & the monkey's.

Do you really think high deployment cost is going to be responsible for as many deaths as coal and FFs, annually?  Now add oil wars. 

What a horrible imagination. Not well thought out.

6700 2018-10-04 12:49:01 Sir, why do you say bear run till 2020? Don't u think after Modiji's re-election (chances looks bright after Mayawati's call) Indian market should bounce back. Next year oil price call of intl institution is between $60-70 which is biggest problem for India. What say please?
6701 2018-10-04 12:49:00 If the public keeps buying snake oil, Trump will keep selling it.
6702 2018-10-04 12:48:56 We don’t want to pay taxes( except few )but we want free food, education, health, loan waivers, loan re structuring ( for industrialists) . Rich farmers are kept away from taxes. We don’t have oil fields either. Where else will ANY GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY generate revenue from.
6703 2018-10-04 12:48:53 Mr. President I know you got a lot on your mind and your plate but please do something about the oil prices that gas is eating up the tax break

6713 2018-10-04 12:47:59 it's not just oil, Corporate side leverage is low but retail side leverage has gone up , so unless deleveraging of retail balance sheet happens you will not see Demand back. 
capacity utilization will remain low, corp will be able to survive if oil goes $100+ unlike 2008.

6746 2018-10-04 12:44:51 I have a recipe for them somewhere although I don't make them often because you have to dip them in frying oil. They're kind of a pain to make at home if you don't have the right set up.

6750 2018-10-04 12:44:36 nope. I liked it fried but with zero oil.    thats why air fryer is best for it.

6773 2018-10-04 12:42:40 markets are correcting its previous incorrect forecast & markets don't look at present, whatever u mentioned is present.
What future will be ? 
Oil going > $100 + - markets are expesive. 
Oil staying where it is - markets are okay priced.
Oil correcting back to $40 - buy dips

6847 2018-10-04 12:37:14 I'm saying oil is a fungible commodity. It doesn't matter whom you literally buy it from, it all essentially goes into one big pot the whole world draws out of.
6848 2018-10-04 12:37:14 Why u r making ppl fool with nonsense stories oil prices has all DECIDED BY OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES then the taxes of IMPORTS added over to it state govt r not willing to support center govt. by reducing state tax.. u hv to look at  your fiscal balance also..

- DON'T GET MIXED UP WITH DRUGS, GANGS OR OIL EXECUTIVES.

6854 2018-10-04 12:36:35 @PMOIndia Sir please see taxing the SUV's and dual pricing of Petrol/Diesel/Gas for SUV's which are guzzling a resource, which we import.  Reducing price encourages people with more disposable income to splurge on Oil.
6855 2018-10-04 12:36:32 This is something like the mal practices done by the shrewd guys dealing in consumer goods that they use to enhance the price then slash the prices use to claim/declare so called "Special Offer", "Mega Savings", "Bonanza" & so on.

Especially when the crude oil price is still 1/1

6921 2018-10-04 12:31:26 check out oil price before and after bombing the shit out of Libya and Iraq , disruption oil means more Dollar oil profit , which Libay and Iraq eventually stopped selling in.

Now that Iran thing , check the chart on oil price since the rhetoric started over last year.
6922 2018-10-04 12:31:23 If you dont like the product, don't buy. If you dont believe in the company, dont invest. Why are the shorts so upset if the $TSLA is such a sure fail. Indeed the oil lobby is in its death throws due to @elonmusk and that is the real reason. Bankruptcy of ICE is about to begin.
6923 2018-10-04 12:31:23 Indian development strategy used to be tied down by the wage goods/food constraint. That eased in recent decades. The structural challenge now is the energy constraint. Indian macro when oil is at $40 is a world apart from Indian macro when oil is at $80.
6924 2018-10-04 12:31:18 “Thanks, T-Bone. Happy to respond. Do you remember back when they promised to cut us a check for $500 MM? Have you ever slept on that sweet MidEast oil money? It’s awesome. Also, Don’t Cross the Line. Later!”
6925 2018-10-04 12:31:12 Thanks @narendramodi ji you have taken a very good step by reducing oil prices. We all know this extra burden will be borne by Central and State Govt. I urge my fellow citizens to pay their direct and indirect taxes with sincerity so that we get more such benefits in future.
6926 2018-10-04 12:30:57 @arunjaitley and @BJP4India was doing strikes on the road when UPA II was hiking the petrol price eventhough at the time Crude oil Barrel was around 140 USD. Now Crude oil Barrel is 80 USD and they are blaming the international market. I say thank god they are not blaming Nehru.

6956 2018-10-04 12:27:58 Reasons behind oil prices hike
- OPEC countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia increases the rate of crude oil for their profit.
- US sanctions on Iran, u can't buy oil from Iran. If u then u will have to face US sanctions as well.
-Venezuela high inflation, nobody wants to invest

6961 2018-10-04 12:27:21 Congress govt in Karnataka refused to cut oil prices says it has already reduced VAT by R2/-.Earlier it increased prices by Rs2/- saying they are waiving farm loan. Then reduced VAT net relief to public Rs0/-.
6962 2018-10-04 12:27:21 Gotta say on this data, im also not sure why oil went up.

Sometimes in commodities i think you have to wait for momentum shifts, maybe bc of short covering, idk?
6963 2018-10-04 12:27:20 The problem is you cannot digest the fact that despite no fall in crude oil prices, the govt was able to give relief. The only topic against Modiji is slipping away from the hands of haters.

6979 2018-10-04 12:26:07 Sir,Prices Of oil should have been reduced little more by doing reduction in Excise duty and asking state governments at least BJP ruled state to reduce in VAT.Even after reduction of Rs.2.50/liter the oil prices r still out of reach to d common men.Though welcome step by d Govt.
6980 2018-10-04 12:26:05 Previous UPA govt,was not oil revenue dependant. Because the then FM, had devised a plethora of taxes on the common man,to offset oil revenue short fall! If he becomes FM now, he would do the same!

I do expect you to answer that Andrew
6985 2018-10-04 12:25:24 Ache din does not mean we get petrol at Rs 50 per litre when international prices have doubled & we import our entire oil needs & Govt not subsidising oil by issuing bonds & passing repayment to next Govt as MMS did

7021 2018-10-04 12:22:14 The World is funny, if the government finds DIAMONDS or OIL in your backyard it's government property but if they find DRUGS it's yours
7022 2018-10-04 12:22:11 @PMOIndia @arunjaitley started doing loose motion under opposition pressure and reduced oil prices, that too at only $85 crude price. It will be interesting to see wat they will do if prices goes to $100 or $120.
Thanks @RahulGandhi and @INCIndia for fighting for people.

7023 2018-10-04 12:22:10 I need a oil change and a alignment like today and I don’t wanna give them people my money 
7024 2018-10-04 12:21:58 Country got it's lollypop. finally,center has given some tiny marginal discount on oil prices "250 आना". What a game it is ! Increase rate continuously and suddenly one day give lollypop. Are we people fool? Obviously not. This is not the right way to maintain fiscal discipline.
7025 2018-10-04 12:21:58 Next hit oil prices 
7026 2018-10-04 12:21:54 @arunjaitley 
You said that Indian Government has deregulated the Oil prices and controls it no more. So how come you can reduce the prices?
With 2.5/- cut in prices how will you pay obeisance to @narendramodi friends? After all it is a big loss. And looking at your skills...
7027 2018-10-04 12:21:48 you wouldn't find many banks that would act on the risk of U.S. sanctions - see Iran and oil sanctions coming in November.

7035 2018-10-04 12:21:17 How do you think the Govt. should address rising fuel prices? 
1. Subsidize fuel significantly by issuing oil bonds and passing repayment burden onto next govt
2. Let consumers pay market price
3. Offer some subsidy by increasing taxes on other items/ cutting govt expenditure

7040 2018-10-04 12:20:45 No transparency. Why would anyone VOTE for Trudeau? Blowing away taxpayers money, creating Islam-Canada, pushing new carbon tax, avoiding seniors & vets, import expensive oil, not creating oil industry, conflict with trading partners, terrorist support, disaster immigration, etc
7041 2018-10-04 12:20:43 He did some redistribution of oil money and increased oil revenue, and maybe some other halfway good things, but he also had problems in many ways. Many rural people were very poor and he reduced the wealth gap, probably a good thing.
7042 2018-10-04 12:20:42 There's is no economic crisis. Only a temporary problem. @narendramodi govt has dealt with the problem smartly. CAD ,fiscal deficit & inflation are under control. NPAs being recovered. GDP growing at 8%. Revenues & GST collection are growing. Only oil is a problem
7043 2018-10-04 12:20:25 Took a sip of Jamaican black castor oil cuz the spirit of my grandma told me to do so. Now my throat is all lubricated
7044 2018-10-04 12:20:15 What are the world's cheapest Oil Marketing Company shares? Think! Disclosure: I own them for long time now and still in substantial profits!
7045 2018-10-04 12:20:10 EXTREMELY IMPORTANT !!!  Next ATTACK on oil prices - is that to keep you from building the wall - budget hold ups ???
7046 2018-10-04 12:20:03 The dollar rates also has huge effect... We import oil products, kung mataas ang value ng piso, makakaangkat tayo ng madami sa murang halaga.. But now, what do you think? Simple analogy. Kung di mo kinakaya maintindihan, mag tanong lang po.
7047 2018-10-04 12:19:58 Now people will rush to buy oil on dips
will that not put additional pressure on the falling rupee?

7055 2018-10-04 12:19:09 Thank God I opened a trade account. After trump announced sanctions against Iran I bought Brent crude oil and it was still around $78 a barrel. Today it's $86 a barrel it can even go up to $100. 

I'm tired of being played by these elites. They are doing this deliberately.
7056 2018-10-04 12:19:04 cong govt managed the oil price $130 per barrel and still petrol wasRs65. Modi should hv done it. who asked him clear all the debts. get the black money and catch all the Modis who escaped.That he will not do. Cong knows the agony of poor people. Modi is for Ambani Adani & Modis

7058 2018-10-04 12:18:31 Its disgusting stuff, give me olive oil and real butter
7059 2018-10-04 12:18:30 Reasons behind oil prices hike
- OPEC countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia increases the rate of crude oil for their profit.
- US sanctions on Iran, u can't buy oil from Iran. If u then u will have to face US sanctions as well.
-Venezuela high inflation, nobody wants to invest
7060 2018-10-04 12:18:27 PFG  Heps were 3.17 in first half so looks like second half between 2.20-2.40. They blame exchange rates and oil prices which has only got worse . Not a good update
7061 2018-10-04 12:18:12 Exactly my point there is none, all speculative and good eneough for the oil market to keep prices rising.
7062 2018-10-04 12:18:04 These rubes are the same idiots who make millionaires out of snake oil selling “religious leaders”.
7063 2018-10-04 12:17:56 Amit shah just congratulated PM for reducing the oil prices by huge margin. Bravo Really 2.5/ lit is really huge. That too when the excise per lit is 21/- .

7125 2018-10-04 12:11:21 Genius, you have problem with your basic GK. biggest oil company is Indian oil. Reliance is the second biggest which is a private company. There was full control on price fixing by oil companies. It is now more than 4 years govt not interfering on price. Do some study first.

7145 2018-10-04 12:10:08 Very good, when oil prices jumps the oil companies are responsible and when price goes down then credit is given to modi ji...
7146 2018-10-04 12:10:01 Let's understand one thing, this is an act of juggling. If the govt had a choice, they won't reduce the price. But are the citizens ready to stand up and support for the sake of the country since we are oil deficient and dependant?
7147 2018-10-04 12:10:01 Do you even little know how things works? Modi doesn't make price high daily. States and centre are levying high tax to pay the oil bond of 2 lac crore rupees.

7304 2018-10-04 11:55:04 How could govt reduce the fuel price.? It was decided by oil companies till yesterday and govt was having no role in increasing fuel prices.

7310 2018-10-04 11:54:48 Oil prices are high due to geopolitical reasons & Re is falling due to Interest Rates rising worldwide. Still Tukdegang minions continue with their 'Why fuel prices are high-Re so low" narrative.

Arrey bhai 4.5 saal mein sabse zyada girey hui cheeze toh aap ho..
7311 2018-10-04 11:54:45 There was a sudden chill overnight, so immediately after the briefing Mike, my co-pilot ran out to the plane to make sure the mechanics pulled the plugs to drain the oil rather than risk bending a rod.
7312 2018-10-04 11:54:41 Publishing the names, addresses and daily schedules of oil company CEO's and large shareholders is probably illegal
7313 2018-10-04 11:54:34 Back then we had an Indian oasis despite a global crisis & record high oil prices, with  Economists in charge 

Now we have a purely #ModiMadeDisaster 
even in the midst of global stability & oil prices still 40% below 2012-13 levels, with Fekunomists in charge
7314 2018-10-04 11:54:34 Only in India the press rouses unique fires! 

No politician should ever give up a chance to douse the oil price fire by sprinkling the very same oil!
7315 2018-10-04 11:54:19 Welcome to the New World the Oil Companies share will tank further tomorrow ...Sensex is at 35169 ...target is 18000
7316 2018-10-04 11:54:04 So true...we shud celebrate only if prices reduce by >20 rs. ,& It stays so irrespective of crude oil rate. Though blind followers ," bhakts" will find  some reason to celebrate even if it increases by 20 rs. All depends on the agenda, not reality!!

7318 2018-10-04 11:53:44 In all probability,crude oil prices will start moving down in next 2 months as OPEC & Russia have started raising the production. Moreover Mr Trump next win will be fall in oil prices. He has appealed twice once in July & second 4-5 days back. It’s a testing time for POTUS too.
7319 2018-10-04 11:53:43 Uganda was never seriously on the table
Hertzl was only interested in safety for Jews, not ideology
Didn't care about Palestine
England wanted Palestine as a pipeline for Iraqi oil without Jews
So they offered Uganda which btw was colonialist of them
Zionists totally uninterested
7320 2018-10-04 11:53:13 The bet on OMC cannot be for next 2 years .. Thesis is if China does succeed in changing landscape from Oil fuelled cars to EV by 2022/23 .. Oil demand will reduce dramatically and India will be indirect beneficiary
7321 2018-10-04 11:53:12 .@realDonaldTrump Chacha thoda crude oil sasta karwana
7322 2018-10-04 11:53:06 Yes my logic is it is temporary relief. For long term India must produce oil and has to manage revenues effectively. Swacch cess will not work but Swacch fine anyone who litters must pay heavily. wil worj=k better than cess.

7330 2018-10-04 11:52:14 Despite 26% rise in crude oil YTD, not to mention new cycle bests in wage growth, 5&10-year breakevens remain well within multi-month ranges. Currently, both are implying sub-2% PCE inflation on average. @TDANetwork @OJRenick @FuturesBen_TDAN

7407 2018-10-04 11:44:53 Why can't give Rs. 20/ltr cut? Oil price in the international market didn't increase a bit, so why increase of Rs. 20/ltr at the first place??
7408 2018-10-04 11:44:47 From +40 C to -40 C quite a change for those guys. Interesting that fact that the oil is not the same everywhere. I've heard that Arg oil is "light" thats why diesel fuel here is in fact imported (or the crude oil used to refine diesel)

7435 2018-10-04 11:42:04 Anyone who was trading oil since 2014 knows fundamentals don´t matter, algos just hunting for big $ stops. They hunted it all the way down to $28 a barrel even though the fundamental picture at the time was bullish. #followthemoney

7439 2018-10-04 11:42:01 The Reserve Bank of India said it will relax the external commercial borrowings (ECB) policy to allow the oil companies to raise external debt for working capital purposes and lifted the individual borrowing limit which was set at $750 million.

7475 2018-10-04 11:39:06 Actually what you said is true madam. Manmohan singh govt subsidised oil with the help of Oil bond. Present govt bought those oil bonds back and bailed India out of oil burden. A rupee rise in oil price worries people but not rise in liquor rate

7477 2018-10-04 11:38:55 Iran accused Saudi Arabia and Russia on Wednesday of breaking OPEC's agreement on output cuts by producing more crude, adding that the two countries would not be able to produce enough oil to make up for a reduction in Iranian exports.
7478 2018-10-04 11:38:53 Solar power in India has been growing at a rate of 113% yoy and now dropped to around ₹4.34 per kWh, which is around 18% lower than the average price for electricity generated by coal-fired plants. Electricity, thus,generated would run our vehicles thereby reducing the oil bills

7480 2018-10-04 11:38:42 Increasing the price of petrol & diesel should avert the oil import crisis, no?

Wait, did they just add fuel to the fire by decreasing the price of Petrol & Diesel?
7481 2018-10-04 11:38:40 US crude oil stockpiles rose by their most in a week since March 2017, driven in part by a build at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub and a drop in exports #EIA. Crude inventories jumped by 8M bbls, four times analysts' expectations. The surprise surge offsets steady Mo/Mo drawdowns
7482 2018-10-04 11:38:37 Your regime has humiliated the Iranian people for the last 40 years by your backward domestic and foreign policies, spending oil revenues for non Iranian without the permission of Iranian people .If you were honest , you would put the question of policies to referendum to see

7679 2018-10-04 11:18:17 Make me understand this: after fuel prices go up by 20 Rs, they get cut by Rs 2 and we ‘celebrate’? What happens now if oil crosses $100 a barrel? Is fuel state controlled or market driven or festival/election driven?

7811 2018-10-04 11:02:21 So after hitting 91 not out with #Petrol, Modi deducts Rs 2.50 per litre. 
Even in that, Rs 1 per litre will come from the OIL COMPANIES.

Re 1/l to be absorbed by OMCs

More than 42-50000 cr market cap of oil companies wiped out for saving 7000 cr fiscal deficit. 

This is long term wealth erosion for annual fiscal adjustments

7817 2018-10-04 11:01:20 While the price of #fossilfuels such as #oil are subject to heavy fluctuations in the international markets, the price of #wood and #pellets is stable, making it the sensible choice for your heating system.

7818 2018-10-04 11:01:02 Jaitley forgot crude oil price was higher in 2012 and jumla party was on top of their voices against Manmohanji. Do you eat what you vomited
7819 2018-10-04 11:00:58 Arun Jaitely announces ₹1.5 cut in #ExciseDuty. Asks oil companies to absorb ₹1. States asked to slash VAT by ₹2.5. Maharashtra & Gujarat oblige. Govt has increased excise duty by almost 300% since 2014. Who are you fooling with the ₹1.5 cut #FuelPriceHike #FuelPrices
7820 2018-10-04 11:00:53 Bro I used to buy halfs and ounces and shit. Now I'll just buy like a 3.5 or an oil tank and whenever the fuck that runs out..... guess I'm waiting till I get paid again to smoke 
7821 2018-10-04 11:00:50 I'll appreciate if u can use ur esteemed media prowess&access to ask
 @ProfOsinbajo  explain to us how we are now selling oil @ $85 yet government revenue is recording a colossal drop also since our president is president/petroleum minister is he now V.P/ finance minister?THANKS
7822 2018-10-04 11:00:49 Louisa!!!!! But it does make me realise how much we take for granted here with the oil heating and flicking the switch for instant heat.
7823 2018-10-04 11:00:49 @rsprasad  Did you say that govt has no powers in oil price? How come today FM tell oil companies to absorb Re.1/- Who has largest share in oil cos? Foolingus? I know you wont reply back to common man like me. I'd voted from Vadodara for Modi in 2014 for not hearing such lies.
7824 2018-10-04 11:00:48 Hahaha. When a country dependent on oil becomes happy to report vehicle sales number, there is fundamental problem.
7825 2018-10-04 11:00:43 Thought bonds led oil...?  Thanks

7831 2018-10-04 11:00:07 Make @asadowaisi @imAkbarOwaisi oil minister, they will import oil prices in 50% discount as Pakistan gets or at least there will be a sure discount @AimimFansClub @withAIMIM @warispathan
7832 2018-10-04 10:59:57 Many thanks to Mr Jateily for so great discount welcome 2019. But How could govt reduce the fuel price.? It was decided by oil companies till yesterday and govt was having no role in increasing fuel prices. Rs 2.50 #FuelPriceCut

7850 2018-10-04 10:58:12 My state is Edo state, they are trying in terms of development and I attribute it to the oil 13% derivation. But for a state like kwara...well you hv said enough I understand you better
7851 2018-10-04 10:58:09 They have to reduce the 250%+ tax they have imposed in past 4 yrs on oil in name of development which is not visible yet . The revenue since crude was $45 from now to govt is about 18lakh cr. Now if they don't restate the tax back to 45% they are goner.

7864 2018-10-04 10:56:56 Twenty years ago, the people of Turkana might not have asked for a share of the oil revenues from the wells in the area. Today, they fought like hell to get a cut. @cobbo3
7865 2018-10-04 10:56:49 ₹5 cut is  a substantial cut. For the common man it amounts to 6% of cost from current levels. Question is what will Government do if the oil continues to rise and adds another 5$ to its price from current levels ? #FuelPriceCut
7866 2018-10-04 10:56:43 I will be on Vishnu Shome program on NDTV at 7pm on the oil related policy announcements.
7867 2018-10-04 10:56:40 You are absolutely correct. Once Crude Oil Price retreated from +$100 a barrel the reimbursement became nothing. Due to Bio fuel is more expensive than Traditional.

7894 2018-10-04 10:54:36 Another instance of insider trading by some bureaucrats of @FinMinIndia

7941 2018-10-04 10:48:15 If @ambkcsingh had shown this much courage to ask MMS & @INCIndia why did you purchased oil with huge debt?
Amount of work done for poor is what India needed to go to next step but Nehruvian will not understand or may I say doesn't have brain to understand this.

7946 2018-10-04 10:47:41 Hmm so Ms. Ghose will deny all global currencies have taken a hit against the dollar
Ms. Ghose will deny that oil has risen sharply in the last few months
Ms. Ghose will deny GST collected is matching targets

Shabbas Ms. Ghose will now get her dollars!
7947 2018-10-04 10:47:40 RT TheBullBull "Falling revenue from oil will stymie infra projects further. If you own infra stocks, consider switching to IT"
7948 2018-10-04 10:47:29 The black gold further extended its gains recently, as it continued to add to its 4-year high. However, recent reports that #OPEC and Russia are quietly increasing production have led to a slight dip in oil prices. #oil

7951 2018-10-04 10:47:06 It's Good Decision by Central Government and Oil Manufacturing  companies together has decided to reduce the Petrole and Diesel prices by Rs. 2.50. 
Maharashtra Government has also reciprocated by reducing VAT by Rs. 2.50.
Relief to the people of Maharashtra.
Thanks MODIJI.
7952 2018-10-04 10:47:05 This whole oil jargon is pointless. The goal should be reduce use of oil, replacement of oil with other sources..

7954 2018-10-04 10:46:55 Seriously what’s behind price hikes 1. The Dollar costs R14.60 2. Oil is over $80 a barrel - convert to US$ and our fuel is not that expensive compared to the rest of the world - the govt promised to pick the up the Rand if it falls and they can’t - well we are waiting for this
7955 2018-10-04 10:46:52 Asking oil companies to bear cost of higher crude, worst form of corporate governance. Is it any wonder that PSUs are worst performing over a decade.

7957 2018-10-04 10:46:41 The talk on diversifying from oil to Agricultural growth drive. Is likened to the talk of a Drunkard. Who claims not to drink anymore when there is no money. And when money shows goes back to drinking. Diversification is in on the news. No reality.
7958 2018-10-04 10:46:21 I agree with the concern of increasing prices of oil, but it is same in other countries also. Stop blaming only person for everything and suggest if you have any innovative ways to bring it down..
7959 2018-10-04 10:46:16 Most undervalued companies: US Oil companies. It has been that way till now. Lots of them up 20-25% over the last 4 months but still pricing Oil at $60 and not even $70.

7963 2018-10-04 10:46:06 This is actually a statement I think most logical people can get behind. Frying something in a skillet with oil in it is one of the bravest things you can do with a short sleeved shirt.

7968 2018-10-04 10:45:38 OIL is going out of control, Govt. strategy has backfired.

The idea was to over tax fuel in the first 3 years and later reduce prices drastically in the last 2 years of government.

Unfortunately CRUDE has went on a rampage and that has failed the govts planning dramatically.

8016 2018-10-04 10:41:21 Centre's @mygovindia reduction of retail oil prices is sensible. Over 115% and 75% retail tax on oil is distorting. FM @arunjaitley is spot on to cut excise Rs 1.50, OMCs' realisations Re 1, asking states to reduce VAT by Rs 2.50, taking total cut to Rs 5/liter of petrol&diesel.

8089 2018-10-04 10:32:40 Govt eats crow. #Petrol #diesel prices cut by Rs 2.50/litr. Oil marketing companies will also share the burden of price cut while Centre will lose revenues up to 10000 cr. States asked to declare cut of equal amount. Dwindling fisc will be market’s new worry now.

8148 2018-10-04 10:26:38 OIL is going out of control, Govt. strategy has backfired.

The idea was to over tax fuel in the first 3 years and later reduce prices drastically in the last 2 years of government.

Unfortunately CRUDE has went on a rampage and that has failed the govts planning dramatically.

8154 2018-10-04 10:26:14 I would add that oil prices are shooting up only because of Iranian sanctions.

8177 2018-10-04 10:24:02 Very Bad decision to cut the excise rate by Rs.1.5 on petrol/diesel. Worse to burden the oil marketing companies with a subsidy of  Re.1 per litre. Bad economics and not sure how much good it will do the people as depreciation of INR will simply offset the decrease in rates.

Will it not be prudent to cut oil import by 10% for next 3 mths & ration the supply to consumers saving abt $9 billion to stabilize ₹ for now.
8192 2018-10-04 10:22:53 Nope. He won’t. Jaitley’s tenure has been more disastrous compared to PC’s. Our trade deficits have surged massively because of excessive oil imports, gold. Don’t know what “Make in India” has achieved. Many Thanks to demonetisation & GST which wrecked our economy even down!
8193 2018-10-04 10:22:30 I welcome the oil price cut done by Central govt. The will help the people and transport business. Now request all the states govt to reduce the price.
@PMOIndia @arunjaitley @CMofKarnataka
8194 2018-10-04 10:22:14 Everybody has a oil price decontrol plan, till they get punched in the face. 
8195 2018-10-04 10:22:12 #petrol Government announced Rs 2.50 cut on oil prices but need to implement GST on fuel prices.
8196 2018-10-04 10:22:05 While I doubt the entire recent episode as narrated by Tanushree Dutta., I do want to state that her personal and professional choices can not be used as benchmark for the allegations levelled. It's different as oil and water. Please refrain from character assassination.
8197 2018-10-04 10:22:02 Given the hard facts that rupee is falling & oil prices globally g rising,  this so called RS 2.50 relief will get neutralised in about 10 days...!!

If this is done having state elections in mind 2 months down the line, take it from me, it boomerangs on BJP!
8198 2018-10-04 10:21:57 AL-FALIH: OIL CONSUMPTION IN 2035 WILL BE `CLOSER TO 120M' B/D

8199 2018-10-04 10:21:41 If I remember correctly, the oil wasn't "sold" , it was "strategically rotated".
8200 2018-10-04 10:21:36 FORGET ABOUT CHABAHAR AND CHEAP OIL FROM IRAN , NOW GET READY TO PAY RS. 100 FOR A DOLLAR . IT IS A SHAME ON OUR PLANNERS . LET US REDUCE OIL AN OTHER NON ESSENTIAL IMPORTS TO SAVE OUR ECONOMY AND COMMON PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. AUSTERITY MEASURES ARE A MUST
8201 2018-10-04 10:21:33 Government cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2.50.

@arunjaitley says central govt and the oil companies will absorb the price cut by 1.50 and 1 respectively.
8202 2018-10-04 10:21:32 Oil stocks dived 15%, right time to invest (as they are already in 52 week low) or should wait ? Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Oil Corporation etc #BSE #Sensex
8203 2018-10-04 10:21:17 @arunjaitley Is anyone in these oil companies doing cost of production and Cost of sale? There happens to be big gap somewhere even if it's done in a crude manner even then the sale price should not be over ₹55.00 per Liter then why is it crossing over ₹90.00 per Liter.
8204 2018-10-04 10:21:14  an oil based one
8205 2018-10-04 10:21:10 @Swamy39 sir, Is there a chance of petrol price touching ₹100/L?, bcoz US imposing more sanctions on Iran from Nov. + Venezuala's oil companies going bankrupt + Russia & OPEC decided to raise crude output.
8206 2018-10-04 10:21:08 Fuel price cut: The nation wants to know how much money did the government and the oil companies loot from the Indians (with at least Rs.2.50 per litre of Petrol/Diesel extra) in the last four and half years! #LootPeChhoot
8207 2018-10-04 10:21:07 @drthomasisaac GOI has reduced oil price by ₹ 1.5 per litre and oil companies by ₹ 1 What’s the response of our Communist FM ?Are you still holding ‘Shylocks’ attitude ?
8208 2018-10-04 10:21:03 Shri @arunjaitley asking oil marketing companies to absorb costs to bring down #PetrolDieselPrice is like turning the clock back. #bizzare. Fears of a #subsidy regime abound. Destroyed #investorwealth. Steeper #ExciseDuty cut would’ve helped.

8212 2018-10-04 10:20:46 Opposition crying even after this cut.

They should form into a consortium and procure crude at lower rates and clear the oil debt too.
8213 2018-10-04 10:20:46 Being supplier & customer to Iran are two different things. Chinese refiners don't give a s..t for US sanctions. EU refiners PREFER to pay €. If the oil price is right China (& India) will lift it. Chinese suppliers are another issue but they can easily set up channels
8214 2018-10-04 10:20:38 @narendramodi ji this is bad move which not required at this point of time. Since rupee is depriciating. FII pulling out the fund CAD has increase oil prices has gone up. So improve sentiment of investers kindly remove the CAPITAL GAIN TAX ON EQUITY

8226 2018-10-04 10:19:24 less than MYR2 a liter during the early 2000s. Price didn't go up that much nor ever touched 3 to a liter thanks to local use of crude oil & mirroring the global oil trade prices.

8231 2018-10-04 10:19:12 @realDonaldTrump Trump is responsible for increased oil prices in international markets. Why should the world pay for Trump's personal problem with Iranian nation.

And in past the goal of higher tax to reduce when require

Yes, they have cut Rs. 1 for oil marketing company. In another way they are cutting divident which it is getting from the companies

8259 2018-10-04 10:16:48 Yes, government can give relief since petrol price was not lowered enough when crude oil was at $30. If government don't have enough funds reserved than remove taxes or implement GST on petrol.

8314 2018-10-04 10:13:05 Iran exports hit lowest level since February 2016. Oil exports are plunging, and fell to their lowest level since at least February 2016 last month at 1.72 million barrels per day. That was a decline of around 250,000 bpd from August, and down roughly 1 mb/d since a peak in April
8315 2018-10-04 10:12:59 BS it was true they treated Ford respectfully with a woman atty . Then the Dems oil over on Kavanaugh and treated him like a pariah that is Bullshit and you know it. Finally someone and most people are calling you out on this .

8322 2018-10-04 10:11:48 So no oil city?
8323 2018-10-04 10:11:44 was there any other solution??

cribbing about oil prices will lead to such immediate populist steps!

But the bigger qs is - do we have a architectural plan in the medium to long term??
8324 2018-10-04 10:11:19 @AmitShah govt should take people in confidence ,  there should have been all out effort from govt to explain people to understand   rise of  oil price.  also further steps to be taken, govt can request  office goer to share their car ,
8325 2018-10-04 10:11:14 This is essentially pointless as oil companies will hike prices by ₹2.5 over the next two weeks or less

8327 2018-10-04 10:11:07 Oil held near four-year highs on Thursday, supported by the imminent loss of Iranian supply through U.S. sanctions, but also tempered by the prospect of a rapid production boost from Saudi Arabia and Russia.
8328 2018-10-04 10:11:05 Consumption of petrol.should be reduced.Every person should.decide.not to use vehicle.once in a week
if oil  consumption is reduced by 10%,by collective efforts ,things can be controlled to.a.large.extent.

8334 2018-10-04 10:10:27 @arunjaitley Frds there is nothing to cheer this cut of Rs2.50 per/ltr it will be increased in less than 10 days during UPA crude oil was 140 Dollar we got Petrol@70 today it's 86 Dollar we r paying 91 per/ltr it's nothing but to fool again for few days it's not long term remedy
8335 2018-10-04 10:10:18 Ah, the next war. I would have thought Hezbollah would be ready and able to resist an Israeli ground assault. Though, if Iran is involved, then the US is all in, and they will be seeking to secure oil in Iran. So the real war will be in Iran.

8339 2018-10-04 10:09:56 So what you trying to say @arunjaitley for our people. You’re a finance minister you can waive the tax for the petroleum products, just blaming it others.. crude oil prices raised etc., in congress govt we are happy but in BJP govt we are puppets.
8340 2018-10-04 10:09:54 Here's the good news:
Saudi Arabia and Russia agree that the current Oil price will hurt them more than benefit them as it might hit Global economy. They have agreed to increase in production and as a result, Oil prices might cool down over the next few months
8341 2018-10-04 10:09:51 I wish you people and your media will remember all these grammar when reverse is the case,you can't keep profiling Fulani and expect soft landing when the tide turns.

8342 2018-10-04 10:09:36 Average 10% drop in share price of oil companies within 5 minutes of jaitley ji's press conference. WOW.
8343 2018-10-04 10:09:34 Union govt will cut excise duty by 1.50 on petrol and diesel, while oil marketing companies will cut prices by 1.00 :

Petrol is cheaper by at least 2.50 from tomorrow.

States should cut VAT on petroleum products too
8344 2018-10-04 10:09:22 Finally Jaitley eats crow. All bravado given up and he has got to his knees. 
To ask publicaly listed Oil company's to reduce prices is violation of Governance  principles.
8345 2018-10-04 10:09:21 Now pls ask Kejriwal & Amrinder Singh to reduce state imposed tax on oil & give immediate relief to their people!
8346 2018-10-04 10:09:20 US stock futures are off 0.5% with Asia mixed and Europe lower.  Oil is $76.27 with gold at $1,203.  I can hear a little air coming out of today’s ballon.  Pump it up.
8347 2018-10-04 10:09:13 Finally the oil turnt up :D no more being cold in the morning and night
8348 2018-10-04 10:09:12 Getting oil from reliance is truly impacts our economy and is the cause of economy crisis
8349 2018-10-04 10:09:10 JUST IN: Excise Duty cuts of Rs. 2.50 on petrol and diesel to be borne by Centre and oil companies, says Jaitley
8350 2018-10-04 10:09:10 Urhwapiliso.. Former minister sold our oil illegally and she resigned
8351 2018-10-04 10:09:02 OIL BAROMETERS: Brent Most Overbought in 6 Years; WTI Call Skew  (Source....guess.... bloomberg)
8352 2018-10-04 10:09:00 In view of past data of oil import prices, govt. should have kept some margin or reserves to deal with this situation. I think, we can not classify it as a abnormal shocking situation. In past Crude prices gone upto $134 still a big gap.
8353 2018-10-04 10:08:56 Oil for the light.
8354 2018-10-04 10:08:47 Did you know india import petroleum? Did you know the current international market price of crude oil? Idiot.
8355 2018-10-04 10:08:45 おぉー！当たるといいなぁぁぁぁ！！
8356 2018-10-04 10:08:45 So we are back to asking oil marketing companies to subsidise fuel.

JUST IN: Government cuts fuel prices by Rs 2.50. Of which Rs 1.50 will be excise duty cut and Rs 1 will be absorbed by OMCs.
8357 2018-10-04 10:08:41 Its better that #india speak to #US president #Trump regarding high oil price impact on economy of india & to import cheap oil from #Iran. Otherwise #BJPMission2019 will be in trouble.
8358 2018-10-04 10:08:36 Oil marketing companies fell like anil ambani companies
8359 2018-10-04 10:08:36 Market needs more 'comforting news' to bring down Oil Prices and strengthen the Rupee. Perhaps govt could think of 'quantitative easing' as an experiment to bring liquidity in the market.
8360 2018-10-04 10:08:35 yes.. until now, Senes were bashing "selfish" middle classes for talking abt high oil prices n phony table-charts were being peddled to show how benign the govt was n scolding them for not caring abt infra... esp "vikas"... ahankari raj.
8361 2018-10-04 10:08:35 Difficult times calls for tough measures. Atleast they trying best to maintain fiscal. Yes Oil shall inch up higher but you have enough reserves this time to intervene at the last resort. A tooth for tooth a nail for nail.
8362 2018-10-04 10:08:33 The aforementioned sugar soap on the walls is essential, orange/citrus oil is good to finish with, plus use foaming upholstery/carpet cleaner on soft furnishings/carpet. Obviously put the curtains through a hot wash if possible.
8363 2018-10-04 10:08:20 The Bureaucrats never learn, they just don't. They think they are over-smart @arunjaitley @FinMinIndia @PMOIndia 

Market Cap of PSU Oil OMC's fell by a full Rs 55000 Crores today. Just to save Rs 7000 extra going into the fiscal deficit by passing on Rs 1 per litre hit to OMCs
8364 2018-10-04 10:08:10 Then why are you exporting your Oil ????
8365 2018-10-04 10:08:06 Rs 2.50, Much needed Relief n Respite to people after oil prices being slashed. @arunjaitley thanks for your intervention and providing succour to people. It reinforces people's trust in @narendramodi @PMOIndia Govt

8385 2018-10-04 10:06:37 Oil import is same. The rupee has devalued and the crude has gone up. Did you ever pass the benefit when both the rupee was at 66 and crude around 60?

8392 2018-10-04 10:06:17 As oil is a major financial source in Nigeria, it is possible for Agriculture too, because we eat every day. I suggest Govt should budget more for Agriculture, we should export more of our food product to international community. One day oil go finish, we don't have resvervoure

8411 2018-10-04 10:05:06 No. When crude oil price come down then.
8412 2018-10-04 10:05:04 India cuts taxes on fuel. The Central government has decided to cut Rs 2.50 (excise duty cut by Rs 1.50 and Oil companies to cut Re 1) with immediate impact

One if his Mantri said I don't have any problem with fuel because he gets it for free of cost
8419 2018-10-04 10:04:23 Other downside of a high oil price is additional investments of oil companies in new projects, which higeres the total oil supply to the market
8420 2018-10-04 10:04:20 Oil marketing companies are like toy in hand of govt. They could be played either way. 
#Petrol #Diesel
8421 2018-10-04 10:04:15 Take "LOT" of investment and need time.. and more than that clear policy on it.. I think this govt has done policy part but investment and technology need time .. best way right now is to increase the ethanol production.. the oil imports are bound to rise
8422 2018-10-04 10:04:14 What a bunch of crap we have lost nothing in capacity since oil dropped to 50 dollars a barrel but we are still paying prices as if was 150 dollars a barrel at the pump , fuel 326 a gallon in states 23 cents difference in dollar furnace and diesel are same fuel
8423 2018-10-04 10:04:06 @realDonaldTrump America  decreased oil exports on  China to near 0%. Kuwait decreased oil exports on America, ban oil imports from Saudi Arabia and sustain American oil producers. Oil prices will not increase.
8424 2018-10-04 10:04:04 Sharp cut in #Petrol , #diesel price of 2.5 rupee/litre, sharp drop in prices of oil marketing companies, @BPCLimited @HPCL @IndianOilcl, difficult to compare between oil companies &fuel prices

8428 2018-10-04 10:03:46 in a week or two this reduction will be offset by further increase in the crude oil prices, as for we the people.
8429 2018-10-04 10:03:41 But it was an 8 year old oil painting. The end :-)
8430 2018-10-04 10:03:35 This may have been necessary, and the budget impact is not even 1 month's shortfall in GST collections. But this is very very disappointing to anyone who invested in oil companies believing they were independent companies. The PSU discount is completely justified for this reason.
8431 2018-10-04 10:03:34 Petrol, diesel get cheaper by Rs 2.50/litre: Centre cuts excise duty by Rs 1.50; state oil companies- @IndianOilcl @BPCLimited @HPCL - to absorb 1 rupee

Finance ministry has written to states to reduce VAT on diesel and petrol by Rs 2.50, therefore the total cut will be Rs 5.00 : FM @arunjaitley
8441 2018-10-04 10:02:17 Only negative is Centre putting part of burden on oil companies though petrol and diesel prices are deregulated as per policy. Oil marketing cos stock prices fall 15 to 20%.

8448 2018-10-04 10:01:42 Bernie pressured Disney and Amazon, arguably the two companies that are most progressive in this. Meanwhile, we have big oil’ Walmart and the fast food industry just shambling along. Holler at me when he actually succeeds in getting Walmart to pay living wages.

8454 2018-10-04 10:01:09 How about a politician who instead of driving/flying all around the country campaigning, does everything virtually (or at least uses an electric car)?  We can't keep screaming at the oil companies without changing our own behavior.
8455 2018-10-04 10:01:03 You have to pick timelines based on context of developments. It’s only in the last six months that we’ve seen growing concerns over emerging market stability, rising oil prices, and an overall concern about currency depreciation around the world. That’s why I picked 6 months.
8456 2018-10-04 10:01:01 Aaj bhi rupay aur PM ki garima giri hai, lekin crude oil abhi 85 dollars/barrel hai phir petrol 80-92/L kyon ?  Aur 2013 mein petrol gas ko lekar BJP sadko pe nanga nach kayon karti thi..

Noise is irrelevant

They should drill much cheaper than $15M pencilled in

So ~4p Cash after Prospect S costs

Non holder but will short the spike prior to TD or lump in on oil discovery

8860 2018-10-04 09:11:53 Sardesai,are you happy about falling Rupee as it is another stick to beat Modi regime without considering the inernational  factors.If crude prices rise what can the Govt do?To  pass on the burden to the future by borrowing against oil bond as UPA Govt did.
8861 2018-10-04 09:11:44 @narendramodi Sir you will loose election because of 2 reasons.. 1. Oil prices.  2. SC ST Act.

8864 2018-10-04 09:11:19 #Saudi Q2 has 82% yoy oil revenue growth driven by rising oil prices. Gives SAMA more flexibility to maintain riyal peg: keep matching Fed interest rate hikes (raise repo rate) or allow SAIBOR to climb if LIBOR rises (curb excess liquidity). Positive as peg key to macro stability

8867 2018-10-04 09:11:11 Rising oil and interest may spark wider MENA instability. 

Egypt, for example, is highly import-independent and indebted. Government designates 1.9% of GDP to food subsidies.

8881 2018-10-04 09:09:18 That’s just it! There’s always enough oil! But politically there’s not enough money in someone’s pocket. So the games begin, and cause the market to fluctuate.
8882 2018-10-04 09:09:18 I think the Fed is underestimating the feedback loops into the US economy from trade war, weaker EM, higher oil prices etc. We are not far from the "neutral rate" although Powell thinks otherwise. Likelihood is rising that the Fed will make a policy mistake...
8883 2018-10-04 09:09:10 @arunjaitley the entire world is unaffected by the oil price except India why? Why can’t we peg our rupee to the dollar? What’s preventing the giver from doing this? I, a staunch supporter of BJP is disturbed to see our rupee crumbling while petrol prices are hitting roof

8887 2018-10-04 09:08:49 The #ICJ ruled that "Both Parties [#Iran and US] shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve". This could be a face-saving pretext for U.S to backtrack from costly oil sanctions due in November.

8969 2018-10-04 08:53:10 It’s wrong to say the FGN has been using low oil prices as an excuse for its ineptitude when it doesn’t admit to ineptitude!
Rather, the FGN claims to have done more with less.
8970 2018-10-04 08:53:00 @narendramodi @AmitShah its without saying that there is a strong need to take necessary steps to keep a Tab on the USD & the rising Oil Prices. Duties on all the LUXARY Items being imported by Indians should actually be doubled up to desist Indians from senseless imports

8985 2018-10-04 08:49:44 Agreed, in the long term. Even with the improved oil price they're expecting to run a deficit until 2023. Vision 2030 is supposed to diversify the economy and help the situation but its a long term plan. Suspect spending will remain at 7-8% of GDP over the next few years though.

9114 2018-10-04 08:30:12 Renault & McLaren still waiting for engine oil (Castrol). Shipping had been delayed by the typhoon. Now it seems to be stuck in customs at Tokyo. No running on Friday if it doesn't arrive in time. Red Bull not affected as they are using Exxon/Mobil.

9120 2018-10-04 08:28:12 Future: Arun Jaitley says Banks and NBFCs are well liquidated in India, the govt. is assessing and monitoring the rupee and crude oil price situation closely. Mudra Loan to boost SMEs and employment across sectors. PSU Banks are in a much better shape now.
9121 2018-10-04 08:28:07 Trump is destroying our world. Its corporate polluters over our water & air. He plunders our national parks & protected lands because there maybe oil there. the only thing he hears is $$. He doesn’t understand that his own grandchildren will suffer in this world he is destroying.
9122 2018-10-04 08:27:51 That goes for both believers & nonbelievers. Don’t put me in a box. The Holy Spirit flows like oil. I will not be a construct of man’s perspective or worldly opinions. I am not a friend of this world. I am friendly. But I am friends with Jesus Christ before I am anything

9133 2018-10-04 08:26:35 You have very little knowledge and I sincerely ask you to study more!

Do you know through which country ISIS exported oil?
9134 2018-10-04 08:26:33 The stock market is in a huge bubble. Oil prices are passing $80 a barrel and will be $100 by Feb. We will be in a resession/depression by 2020 and mostly not really Trump's fault but he will be blamed for it. Bet you won't be giving him "A"s then. Stop the hero worship.

9156 2018-10-04 08:23:31 In 2018 money terms - This is not big. I work for an independent oil company and this is equivalent to a typical country capital budget. If we could spend this and have all the fame and glory Merc is achieving globally - Its a no brainer.

9172 2018-10-04 08:20:16 When we are so dependent on oil, why couldn't our ministers look for alternative sources like gas, solar, coal n etc. by forcing industry to convert using these, we could have avoided the current mess. however our government was busy demonization n helping fraudsters escape.
9173 2018-10-04 08:19:58 OIL THEFT & RESOURCES !!!
9174 2018-10-04 08:19:57 Powell and Evans both fairly relaxed in recent commentary. I think the move in yields is more a response to higher Treasury issuance and growing price pressures (from oil and tariffs) than hawkish tone.
9175 2018-10-04 08:19:34 @arunjaitley Sir, Its 73.45 INR vs $. and Oil Prices at all time high!! Where is India heading? Are you taking any measures to fix this or leaving for All the more Ache Din to come?

9186 2018-10-04 08:17:46 Put simply: you're running a train line between the oil capital of Europe and Scotland's capital city; there's an *expectation* on you to do better. And you must. Terrible impression left because of shocking service. So wasteful. Pity.
9187 2018-10-04 08:17:36 Between the escalating oil prices and President Trump's sanctions on China & Iran, the world economic scene has become pretty gloomy. Serious economic problems for India in the offing. Not getting enough attention.
9188 2018-10-04 08:17:30 When you increase the capacity to refine your own oil, you now buy crude oil which is a lot cheaper than the refined products. You could even sell the some to you neighbors without their own refineries, easing off some pressure from the global fuel price fluctuations...

9204 2018-10-04 08:13:46 On OPSF
It's not a bad thing. Deregulation of oil was the alibi to scrap it. Actually, it was the large budget deficit. Govt can't sustain it. BUT it gave comfort to Filipinos at the expense of oil companies and govt.

9220 2018-10-04 08:10:20 FM should make a Statement. RBI governor will definitely make correct decisions. Oil is not only purchased by India but also so many other countries. It's because of Trump's apathy towards Iran, OEC and Russia have ganged up to teach a lesson.

9241 2018-10-04 08:08:38 Blame game starts. One saying congress and other oil import.
9242 2018-10-04 08:08:37 "We are protecting Germany, we are protecting France..", said Trump in July in a meeting in reference to the oil and gas business with Russia, neither did they respond nor the media highlighted it. Why now?

9265 2018-10-04 08:06:11 Emissions are way up. Pipelines are being pushed like never before, huge LNG plant approved, 2 gigantic oil sands mines just opened and the biggest one ever about to start.

I guess those facts are too much for you. 
Now crawl away like a toddler

9270 2018-10-04 08:05:33 It is true that Oil Import is One of the Key Reason, but it is No Excuse for the Politician to Try to Make Quick Money in the Garb of Selling Bio-Fuels as the Politicians owns Sugar Factory..

9299 2018-10-04 08:01:14 Overpopulation. If we stop eating Palm Oil we move onto something else and screw that up. Our world is built on endless growth and it is mathematically not sustainable. Farmers across the world looking for any potential land to grow food to feed their families. We would do same.

9302 2018-10-04 08:00:50 India has accumulated a massive currency reserve of 400 bn USD. They should have built a strategic oil reserve as long as oil was cheap. Now, it is too late.
9303 2018-10-04 08:00:48 The US dollar surged yesterday as positivity over a stronger US economy, oil over $85/barrel, Italy, and the World Bank downgrading SA’s growth forecast all took their toll on the rand. $USDZAR

9310 2018-10-04 07:59:40 A month ago Jaitley wrote in his blog that GDP growth has been less than modest but macro fundamentals are robust. See how fast macro deteriorates with oil prices, CAD, rupee, bond yields going out of whack. Lesson : domestic fundamentals largely flow from global fundamentals.
9311 2018-10-04 07:59:39 There are currently only two places in the world that are not selling or processing all the oil they produce. One is Iran. It is left to second, the US, to start selling all it produces (+ SPR releases) and OPEC/Russia spare capacity to fill the Iran void. Can it be done?

9335 2018-10-04 07:55:23 #RupeeVsDollar Lame excuse that Rupee is falling due to rising price of Crude Oil. In UPA Rule crude oil touched $150/ barrel ($80/barrel now) yet $ was managed at ₹60. Problem is mismanagement & corruption.

EM resumes the backfoot due to:

- UST yields higher (despite FF futures lacking conviction in 2019 hikes)
- Oil prices were already rising
- $ bulls emboldened

9394 2018-10-04 07:41:47 What's the difference between a brothel and a handful of old stale oil?
9395 2018-10-04 07:41:39 ₹ and mkts continue to fall, oil going up. Rate hike might cushion the rupee but generate headwinds for growth & fisc. Cut in Petrol-taxes will control inflation but hurt fisc.

Even oped writers know it. Wonder whether the govt knows any better. Doesn’t even have a CEA.

9421 2018-10-04 07:36:43 It seems to me, intellectual rigour should be regarded as much more important than originality. Instead, the opposite applies. This leads to snake oil merchants being acclaimed and given tenure; people who conclude sensible things based on rigorous research being ignored.

9534 2018-10-04 07:16:20 Why are we paying over $3.00 bucks a gallon for gasoline at the pump? when Anwier is open and pumping oil for the US,  I understand we are even selling our excces oil, it shld be no more than $2.00  a gallon or even $1.50 a gallon, $1.25 for Co. 25cts tax, it's our oil, right?

9537 2018-10-04 07:15:49 Now, I'm sure when petrol prices begin to pinch, people naturally reduce petrol consumption & look for other alternatives. That will prompt OPEC to fall in line, and remove the cap on oil production. American sanctions on Iran prompts the cartel to keep production of oil down.

9567 2018-10-04 07:11:26 That's how it is. That's how market forces work. At the moment our weak currency is affecting us badly in one area, the oil import bill. By not reducing the price of Petrol, GOI plays it smart. As a result, in spite of high prices of petrol, inflation remains low.

9663 2018-10-04 06:59:51 it must be 2013 figures. UK, Austrlia and all non oil producing country currencies are suffering against dollar currentlyin equal terms ..
9664 2018-10-04 06:59:34 What was the guy even asking? Most leftist get schooled by MAGA supporters, or at least people who know what's actually going on.. as long as the oil economy is up, I ain't complaining lol only people complaining are the ones who ain't getting welfare and handouts anymore
9665 2018-10-04 06:59:29 Update: It's not a question of what happens in the absolute short term, rather its the disturbing trend emerging in factors which will have atleast a medium term impact on the corporates and the Economy - currency(slated to move beyond 80 in 2019!) and Oil and interest rates ...
9666 2018-10-04 06:59:26 Our country is going to be another Venezuela soon. Any illiterate people can become finance minister of India, all he has to do is when there is money required, they increase oil price in India and gather money and maintain taxation system.

"All County" has a really nasty history as a polluter. If these are the same jerks we twice sued, they sold contaminated waste oil to the poor. Mob-oil.

9724 2018-10-04 06:50:05 Everyone is getting ready for the real onslaught between Trump vs. Xi Jinping which might catch many traders exposed to China unawares. Many people who shorted oil some months back are now regretting it now.

9918 2018-10-04 06:17:49 You know "snake oil salesmen"? It's a metaphor for people who used to roll into sound to sell bogus products.  Kinda like people & exchanges shilling ICOs and shitcoin.

The small coins have alot of P&D. Even larger coins do. It's a mess.
9919 2018-10-04 06:17:49 I recently started using products with no sulfates, silicones, parabens, or mineral oil. I also use a T-shirt to dry my hair instead of a towel and it eliminates so much frizz

Let oil price rise to 300dollars per barrel, with a man of buhari's caliber at the helm of affairs, no impact will be felt.

I hope nothing happens

9960 2018-10-04 06:12:54 Though it makes sense, I saw a complain by Kapcherop residents complain of lack of water system in their areas yet serving the whole of Eldoret. 

May be, the same is needed by Murang'a residents as a token.

Turkana too are pursuing their oil.

9985 2018-10-04 06:07:55 Likely, a rise price of the oil to $100 or more would be damage the world economic and lead to a financial crisis imminent.
9986 2018-10-04 06:07:49 Yeah, the Russians were in need of money and at that time people didn't know yet that there were gold and oil in that area.
9987 2018-10-04 06:07:38 Do you know a company called "Wipro"? They were manufacture of cooking oil. How did they get into other kind of businesses as per you logic??
9988 2018-10-04 06:07:32 The  situation in the oil market will quickly translate into prices at petrol stations. This will be particularly evident in the case of diesel. #Conotoxia 
9989 2018-10-04 06:07:19 Right. Those countries that are doing well with their oil wealth, do they have two heads. Nigeria is just cursed with brainless, insanely selfish leaders. Has nothing to do with oil.

9991 2018-10-04 06:07:00 The  price of a barrel of crude oil exceeded 85 dollars. Drivers are  worried, not only about rising raw material costs, but also about the  strength of the American currency. #Conotoxia

9996 2018-10-04 06:06:04 don't know if we'll get 100 dollar oil next yr but underinvestment of the past few yrs from the crash makes that figure likely within a few yrs. and not even factoring in supply disruption from geopolitical tensions

10003 2018-10-04 06:05:05 Does Saudi Arabia have enough experience as all oil business from exploration to export within Saudia is handled by Americans?
