1 2018-12-19 23:59:37 Ceding Syria to Russia and unshackling a spectacularly corrupt Russian oil/gas oligarch, all in one day.

How exactly does this make America great, ever?

3 2018-12-19 23:59:29 Listening to Megan Woods in QT yesterday, she has absolutely no idea about the oil ‘n gas industry, let alone the hydrogen industry. Her ignorance is astonishing and her arrogance about knowing nothing, even worse
4 2018-12-19 23:59:09 You are right! That is frustrating. Western provinces that are running deficits are subsidizing a province that has a surplus. This province subsidizes its university tuitions and daycare costs with equalization dollars and complains about pipelines while buying bloody Saudi oil!
5 2018-12-19 23:59:07 I bought olive oil at the Save-a-Lot today. Didn't need to. Didn't want to wait. Didn't even open it tonight. Seriously considering just holding onto it for the coming whatever.
6 2018-12-19 23:59:07 Dang, that B. Hussein Obama fella can literally do ANYTHING! Got this passed just like he fixed oil!

9 2018-12-19 23:58:54 I am so sorry. But I said the same thing to my doctor, have you ever had pain or illness wait you didn’t care if you wake up in the morning? He said no! How the hell can they tell me at 63 I don’t need my pain medication? They cannot cure me! They want me to try oil also,nada
10 2018-12-19 23:58:52 Our @FLOTUS is a class act and we are very fortunate to have her. Am not surprised about @voguemagazine bc class and Vogue go together like oil and water. Class is class and pigs is pigs; and Vogue ain't class.
11 2018-12-19 23:58:48 A no-shit, real statement on Yahoo finance today: "With oil being so much cheaper, consumers will have more money in their pockets, and that could be inflationary..."
12 2018-12-19 23:58:42 First, you will need to score the fat part (i.e. make slits) and coat with a neutral oil like Sunflower. This will make a great crackling on top.

35 2018-12-19 23:57:53 My estimation is that about 50% of all stop signs could probably be yield signs. Is this actually a conspiracy by big oil?
36 2018-12-19 23:57:42 "Beard oil"

-Guys with Beards
37 2018-12-19 23:57:42 I think it’s less serious than that. I’m thinking Russia is posturing but probably have more of an interest in that sweet Venezuelan oil than threatening the US. Venezuelan govt is going to implode and the Russians wannabe the first in.
38 2018-12-19 23:57:41 I'm vaping cbd oil, listening to Modest Mouse with my girl
39 2018-12-19 23:57:39 "profitably drill a new well" ?? what does that mean, one new well, or 1000 new wells? better question would be, "what WTI oil price does your firm need to maintain gross production and profitability?"
40 2018-12-19 23:57:26 No.
Israel isn't going to give up its Occupied Golan.
Netanyahu wants to formally annex it.

The oil wasn't known about when Israel took the Golan (in 1967 or 1973 can't remember which).
41 2018-12-19 23:57:14 “Electric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities and can drive the world’s machinery without the need of coal, oil, gas, or any other of the common fuels.” -Nikola Tesla
42 2018-12-19 23:57:14 I bought all the crap to change my oil because “I’m going to save money and I’m a car guy”. I did all the fluids on my car once, changed the oil trans fluid in our other car, and said the hell with it. Like @hoonable, the minor savings and disposing process aren’t worth my time
43 2018-12-19 23:57:09 He just picked an oil lobbyist to be new Secretary of the Interior.
44 2018-12-19 23:56:57 One more semester of college and I’m an oil field roughy 

... yikes
45 2018-12-19 23:56:51 I listened to townhalls in Corpus Christi. He said he “responsibly” wants to support jobs. He wants to raise standards and requirements on gas/oil energy sources. And he told the crowd that we need to transition to & heavily invest in renewable resources. Sun & Wind great for TX.
46 2018-12-19 23:56:48 Poverty fell and education rose because of Maduro. He continued the good policies of Chavez and it's no coincidence that when the country refused to allow American oil companies to just have the oil that food disappeared and inflation started.
47 2018-12-19 23:56:46 Oh look.....DETRACTION....all the crap going on......absolutely LOVE the oil and gas truck demonstrations...makes my heart burst with PRIDE!!! The China crap going on and this little potato detracts with this crap....are people actually that stupid?
48 2018-12-19 23:56:35 The envirocunts deemed coal, oil, and nuclear evil. Nuclear is the cleanest possible energy that will not emit CO2 pre-stream. Nuclear is smallest carbon footprint pre-stream. Wind and solar require so much pre-stream carbon footprint that people are willfully ignoring it.
49 2018-12-19 23:56:13 Your rain storm, blame it on Trump
Your headache blame Trump 
Your country doesn’t thrive blame Trump 
Your boyfriend leaves blame Trump 
Your oil in your car blame Trump 
I guess you can blame Trump for everything 
Hell you can even blame Trump for beating Hillary! #NotRussia!
50 2018-12-19 23:56:11 As Art has said before, Oil is THE master resource. It's more important than $. If WS cuts off the spigot then oil prices permanently spike, the entire suburbian experiment & just in time delivery system comes crashing down The way we fuel & feed ourselves is totaly unsustainable
51 2018-12-19 23:56:05 Yeah, crude, the wave of the future. 

Fracking has given a last gasp to a lot of industries. Unfortunately for oil/gas and their clients, those wells dry up much faster. The music will stop soon on that industry and everyone that depends on it.
52 2018-12-19 23:55:51 Just stop! Reread my tweet. I already know the things that MY province has going on besides oil. It’s those who care not to know that r misrepresenting AB by behaving as if all we have is oil. Do you comprehend that?
53 2018-12-19 23:55:50 saw a truck with a shitton of hateful/Confederate bumper stickers, and on the right side of the hitch, where a large space was left— was a scrawl, scribbled in fat oil crayon:

             NRA

55 2018-12-19 23:55:35 Also the wrongest. Was completely on board until cold olive oil went on the tatties, surely everyone knows it should be a) hot and b) beef dripping?! 
56 2018-12-19 23:55:21 He's good. thanks? We've been giving CCB oil, which seems to be helping. 
57 2018-12-19 23:55:14 I really really wish @ChickfilA would stop using peanut oil. I think my daughter would LOVE it since all she eats is chicken nuggets these days but she is so allergic to peanuts she cant eat there. #peanutallergies
58 2018-12-19 23:55:13 You apparently. Everything good we have is due to oil according to you. That’s false.
59 2018-12-19 23:55:10 Who hides in the bakery at Christmas?
A Mince Spy!

(Especially a palm oil free one!)
60 2018-12-19 23:55:01 We're living at the very end of the Age of Petroleum. This is what it looks like. GM is closing down plants to re-tool for the electric vehicle era is part of that. The demand for oil will continue to fall as a ever diminishing number of internal combustion engines remain in use.
61 2018-12-19 23:54:49 Its like engine oil ! GIVE IT UP !!
62 2018-12-19 23:54:41 Sana oil
63 2018-12-19 23:54:35 なーんだかなー。って顔を朝からしてる珍しい日ですがスーツです（真顔
64 2018-12-19 23:54:33 Ugh i need to learn how to change my oil
65 2018-12-19 23:54:32 Giving up the oil fields to Putin's Wagner Group mercenaries or just selling out the Kurds to Erdogan?
66 2018-12-19 23:54:28 I usually take soma which is. Muscle relaxer. If you don’t have any of that you could take the ibuprofen 3, if you don’t have that I suggest any liquid gel, aleeve or Advil. Take 3 of them. Drink a ton of water. Take a hot bath. Rub peppermint oil to the affected area. And pray!
67 2018-12-19 23:54:24 With no way to ship the oil out I could see the "barrel" reaching par with the dollar.
68 2018-12-19 23:54:22 “We need CBCDABC oil for it” -my grandma.. again 
69 2018-12-19 23:54:16 I work at 9 am and I need an oil change I’m on 5% lmao I’m procrastinating hard on that lol
70 2018-12-19 23:54:13 @WhiteHouse @GOP @DNC @TheJusticeDept @DeptofDefense @StateDept @statedeptspox 1) IMO Turkey alone has 2 million sunni salafist & Gaziantep will always be a Qaeda,Nusra,Daesh supply spot, while wealthy Gulf sheiks will always use Oil & Gas money to finance Jihad across Africa+EU
71 2018-12-19 23:54:11 All of which is being caused by American meddling in order to get their oil. The idea that Socialism is bad because it fails is false: Socialism fails because America smashes it wherever it looks. The populace is starving because the food companies aren't releasing food.
72 2018-12-19 23:54:08 My mother never was Mother of the Year. We clashed. Oil and water. I never really understood her and the feeling was mutual. I miss her almost every day.
73 2018-12-19 23:54:07 Kalo pake cleansing oil apakah butuh micellar water lagi? {MU}
74 2018-12-19 23:54:04 Oil paintings, or oily?
75 2018-12-19 23:54:04 Investing in Canadian oil Gas is like investing in typewriters in 1990's. Diversify the economy. SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP.
76 2018-12-19 23:53:56 Do you use products made from oil?
77 2018-12-19 23:53:52  You really don't keep up do you Sanjeev Gupta is spending billions of his own money on a giant renewables project to power his upgraded new steelworks in Whyalla SANTOS is using solar to power it's oil and gas infrastructure
78 2018-12-19 23:53:52 Provinces don't buy oil, private for profit companies do. You could demand that they buy Alberta bitumen and see how that goes...... I guess.
79 2018-12-19 23:53:50 The world is hungry for oil and Manitoba is nearly finished a Hydro dam this is over budget and behind schedule .
80 2018-12-19 23:53:48 And there was the rest of us less than stupid people thinking it was because of your financial backers desire to re instate their lord of light back onto his throne on the mount,we all know it has nothing to do with oil,that game is venezuela.
81 2018-12-19 23:53:42 In fairness to their argument, I am absolutely a poser, and not an actual enthusiast, even though I do change my own oil.
82 2018-12-19 23:53:35 I do not know what was his interest to add oil on the fire.

Honestly when I read all the comments, I'm afraid the show will be canceled while the cast and crew are present and know the truth.
83 2018-12-19 23:53:25 Assuming oil is about oil, may I recommend The Prize, on that subject? Also a terrific documentary series narrated by Donald sutherland on you tube I think.
84 2018-12-19 23:53:14 Are we supposed to be like oil with no way out?
85 2018-12-19 23:53:12 Yeah I can see that but it was ONLY baby oil, vaseline, lotions, coconut oil, shea butter was okay.
86 2018-12-19 23:53:01 Why, when we have perfectly good aprons, does my sis decide to tuck a tea towel into her sports bra to avoid the spitting oil of cooking bacon....????.....I don’t know this child.....
87 2018-12-19 23:53:00 Same. I don't care what color/sex/orientation he/she is, I'd just be happy with someone who hasn't spent their life grifting and selling snake oil to rubes.
88 2018-12-19 23:52:51 @chin_seed_oil 
89 2018-12-19 23:52:50 Here's a tip:

Stop plagarizing CBD oil tweets for clout. 


90 2018-12-19 23:52:37 Kurds aren't your friends. US created the fuck ups they r facing and used them by seemingly helping them yet solving nothing. And we suffer the consequences as neighboring countries' citizens. Stop interfering with other countries fates for money and oil.
91 2018-12-19 23:52:32 The reason is, “steal other people’s oil, Full Spectrum Dominance (US policy, look it up),  and money for the US weapons manufacturers. “. You have been perpetually lied into wars.  And you believe these people?
92 2018-12-19 23:52:21 It’s not oil, but I’m so tired of people who think ‘data’ only means your digital footprint and advertising/e-commerce targeting. There is more untapped data in things than people, and whoever gets to ‘drill’ all of it, definitely has something more valuable than oil.
93 2018-12-19 23:52:15 Feels like somebody(s) elsewhere in oil patch going out and they gotta sell what they can not what they have to.   Setting up some great oppty’s but gotta buy slowly, incrementally.   Would love to see the piece when published
94 2018-12-19 23:52:09 that one's weird but baby oil sounds like a safety thing maybe? idk
95 2018-12-19 23:52:03 me, defending how good cadens smells tooth and nail, covered in blood and crying: WHEN HE DOESNT SMELL LIKE SMOKE OR OIL HE'S A GOOD SMELLING MAN PLEASE EVERYONE PL
96 2018-12-19 23:52:03 ur ok ur gonna be ok america from ur truth from now on be good to other countries do not chase their oil and so forth ok
u hae more now thats worth more than oil u just dont know it
97 2018-12-19 23:51:57 We would lose everything our forces fought and died for. We helped SDF has secured most of the Syrian oil fields. Did you know Russia is getting 25% from Assad for his work? We now hand Assad the rest of the oil to give some to Russia. Also, Turkey will slaughter the Kurds.
98 2018-12-19 23:51:47 BUT IM GONNA BUY THAT OIL NOW AND TRY IT AFTER CHRISTMAS THANKS KIMIZ
99 2018-12-19 23:51:37 The most dramatic thing I ever did was get $400 in $1 bills  . Did that while I was working Fracking in the oil field. Wanted to feel like I had all 100’s . Dream!
100 2018-12-19 23:51:31 Sipping on my scalding hot pussy soup

Me, smacking my lips: "Onion powder... scallops? ...paprika... rapeseed oil... and the unmistakable taste of a fermented 44-year old pussy. Generously yeasted."

The Parisian Committee of the Culinary Arts: "Mon ami! Simply incredible!"
101 2018-12-19 23:51:26 "I have a machine gun. Happy Easter"..?

No thanks, peddle your snake oil elsewhere.
102 2018-12-19 23:51:23 I used to work at a club with a weird rule against clapping your heels like that. It was the most random, also banned baby oil.
103 2018-12-19 23:51:20 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
104 2018-12-19 23:51:20 If we add oil I garuntee we could make so much money.
105 2018-12-19 23:51:15 Of course when it’s hard working oil patch workers protesting the government there is a conspiracy where the funding comes from. But when NDP Socialist protest anything it’s done by heart and soul and private funding. Tom you are a hypocrite. Ndp used to be for the worker.
106 2018-12-19 23:51:15 My moms man really changed my oil and washed my car while I was in Mexico 
107 2018-12-19 23:51:14 おぱよーー！！！！！
108 2018-12-19 23:51:11 We need oil toots. Crude oil is used to manufacture plastic. Your #GreenNewDeal is entirely focused around regression.
109 2018-12-19 23:51:03 The US did not defeat ISIS.  The Syrian Army with support from Russia, Iran, Iraq's PMU and Hezbollah decimated ISIS. The US had a few hits while trying to take Syria's oil wells east of the Euphrates! And blocking the Damascus-Baghdad Highway is nothing to brag about!
110 2018-12-19 23:50:47 spilled coconut oil on my backpack, bedroom floor and birkenstocks..... how has xannys bro or coke
111 2018-12-19 23:50:41 Looooooll that sweeter than sweet , sweet? Just pour sugar into oil and hope for the best
112 2018-12-19 23:50:38 And baby oil.  
113 2018-12-19 23:50:26 Albertan oil addicts
114 2018-12-19 23:50:25 Diesels food now consists of half of his homemade stew, half kibble, 4 tablespoons of lamb bone broth and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Although I’m going to switch from olive oil to salmon oil once I find a good one. All that and he’s still mad at the TV all the time.
115 2018-12-19 23:50:17 Fucking love the action going on in Nisku. #ableg Canadian Oil, not Blood Oil. #skpoli #fnpoli #cdnpoli
116 2018-12-19 23:50:12 Hey! So I use coconut oil all the time and it's great. I usually toy in the shower or right when I get out so I put the jar in the shower with me (closed of course) and the heat of the shower is enough to melt it super quick. I think you only need like 80° F to melt it.
117 2018-12-19 23:50:09 are they at an oil rig 
118 2018-12-19 23:50:06 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
119 2018-12-19 23:49:57 Darn car is broke again Why should an oil pan rust out. That something like they spray under cars  Must work really great  If anybody feels up to@it you can buy me a new car Nothing expensive just around a hundred thousand
120 2018-12-19 23:49:53 Ceding Syria to Russia and unshackling a spectacularly corrupt Russian oil/gas oligarch all in one day.
 
Wow.
121 2018-12-19 23:49:49 No one says boo when they are excuting apostates. We shouldnt loan their regime a dime and let the people overthrow the kingdom next time oil prices drop
122 2018-12-19 23:49:47 Is CBD oil available in Norway??

130 2018-12-19 23:49:00 And you keep lapping it up. Meanwhile, he has stuffed the courts with conservative judges, lowered taxes and regulation, moved the embassy in Israel, increased oil exploration, and his economy has record low minority unemployment. (Just like your NY Times predicted.)

136 2018-12-19 23:48:47 You forgot, all that traffic helps the oil economy too.
137 2018-12-19 23:48:39 Look I’m very pro pipeline but this protest is making me late to the gym so I now want to abolish the oil industry.
138 2018-12-19 23:48:31 I need to get back on my weed oil properly. My energy is legit draining faster and faster the longer I'm not using it.
Also I can't sleep
139 2018-12-19 23:48:25 Agree. I Would not subscribe to a correlation between grains and energy rooted in biofuels. For me more crude to Rouble to wheat and farm crop cost. Biofuels demand mostly inelastic to oil price.
140 2018-12-19 23:48:23 The safest and best long term solution is to export Alberta oil and gas  through pipelines. Many people not involved in the oil business do not understand this. With new technology the pipelines are monitored daily to prevent oil spills. Also much safer to the citizens of Canada!
141 2018-12-19 23:48:14 After 2 months of my warning lights being on, ya girl is finally getting her oil changed and tires balanced and rotated.
142 2018-12-19 23:48:05 They bleeded for oil for Israel.
143 2018-12-19 23:48:03 With all that new oil under Texas the US doesn't need the Arabs
144 2018-12-19 23:47:55 Agreed 100%. We need responsible and sustainable palm oil producers, as other oils have a more devastating effect.
145 2018-12-19 23:47:42 I have retired for the second time in order to have enough time to learn Clojure. Not enough brain oil to burn any past 10:00pm, let alone midnight.
146 2018-12-19 23:47:41 So your complaining about others fighting for better human rights on oil and YOUR standard of living.
147 2018-12-19 23:47:40 Chebeh oil
148 2018-12-19 23:47:38 Clearly you know as much about the Canadian oil industry, and refining oil, as you do about anything else. So fuck all.
#WeakAndy
149 2018-12-19 23:47:36 Well, I want oil to start flowing in a pipeline sooner instead of later.  However, making the Henday into a mess is absurd as a lobbying method. Glad I got off in time.  #yegtraffic
150 2018-12-19 23:47:36 めっちゃ頭痛い。
かち割れそう。
151 2018-12-19 23:47:29 And for the first time in 50 years, the United States is the number one exporter of oil and for the first time since 2005, the price per gallon for gasoline is below $2.00
152 2018-12-19 23:47:07 Any products? Oil, serum, spray, gel?
153 2018-12-19 23:47:07 LIKE AN OIL
154 2018-12-19 23:47:01 And the troops in iraq whats gonna happen to them? Oh i forgot iraq is a rich country with oil so actually it doesn't matter.
155 2018-12-19 23:46:26 If I use enough tea tree oil maybe I’ll just burn all my skin off ?
156 2018-12-19 23:46:19 Its folly to think that oil will continue to be used to the extent it is now. Alberta placing 'all its eggs in the oil basket' would be suicide. That's the same stupidity that Stephen Harper flogged. Oil is in decline & the sooner Alberta accepts that, the better off we'll all be
157 2018-12-19 23:46:10 Gold sucks and always has.  Same w oil
158 2018-12-19 23:46:06 Ah, snake oil Congress people combined with that old population bomb zero population growth propaganda of the 70's, weather transfer. BS flag!
159 2018-12-19 23:45:59 I want some new tires and a oil change for Christmas
160 2018-12-19 23:45:41 *at the vape shop* what do you MEAN there's no DBT oil
161 2018-12-19 23:45:39 You work in oil and gas?
162 2018-12-19 23:45:34 Have you ever seen a oil and gas location? There would be more damage to one of your efficient trucks driving to location than they'd get paid.
163 2018-12-19 23:45:31 Plus we taught them how to slant drill &steal oil
164 2018-12-19 23:45:27 No but in all seriousness mix it with a lil almond oil to thin it bc both are good for hair growth 
165 2018-12-19 23:45:26 The motivation was still oil. The fact that the country lacked oil and industry is irrelevant.
166 2018-12-19 23:45:26 The US had 3 cards to influence the Syria endgame:
—Aid to the opposition
—Conditional reconstruction assistance 
—Troops & allies controlling 1/3 of the country & key oil/gas resources

Trump has now given them all away for...nothing.

Baghdadi & ISIS still in Syria!
167 2018-12-19 23:45:19 They probably complain Alberta didn't send them enough money yet or BC complain that oil money paid for this while they both pollute the oceans
168 2018-12-19 23:45:17 Come to our Oil Spill in April.. yall gotta be turnt though
169 2018-12-19 23:45:07 @realDonaldTrump So now you want to sell off and destroy the Grand Staircase? Just when I thought there wasn’t any way that you could be a bigger piece of shit.... What’s on tomorrow’s agenda? Separating children form parents, selling wildlife reserves to oil companies? RESIGN!!!
170 2018-12-19 23:45:06 So much talk about CBD oil....  Is this something kids can use too?  I know nothing about it.  Enlighten me friends, please..
171 2018-12-19 23:45:02 No, the elite  wants a pipeline through Syria and Assad said NO. Besides, Syria has a lot of oil
172 2018-12-19 23:45:02 every present for men is beard oil. sorry for all the beard oil yr gonna get, men
173 2018-12-19 23:45:01 Nadie me ha podido aclarar el caso de la standard oil. La eliminación de ese monopolio gracias a la intervención estatal. Monopolios pueden seguir ocurriendo aún sin regulaciones.
174 2018-12-19 23:44:25 Yes , most quebecers understand where their federal transfers come from. Why would they prefer saudi oil to our own, saudi oil gets them NOTHING
175 2018-12-19 23:44:19 Maybe I’ll just get an oil change in the morning
176 2018-12-19 23:44:11 อ่านนส.แล้วเปิดเพลงไปด้วย แล้วในหัวก็มีแต่เสียงมุนบินนนน
177 2018-12-19 23:43:44 I’m holding my son child hood back...I need to keep it old school and give him his castor oil for the winter...  I went thru it.
178 2018-12-19 23:43:41 It’s amazing how many people from Alberta seem to think adding more oil to the world market will solve their problems...  There is a world oil glut...  supply and demand...  more oil will drive the price down further....  who wants to invest in something that will lower returns?
179 2018-12-19 23:43:38 Have you considered Tillerson? Look at the immense damage he did to the State Department, driving away a huge number of experienced diplomats, gutting our ability to do foreign policy. Hard to see how a true Russian asset could do any better. Russian oil money offers a motive.
180 2018-12-19 23:43:33 I'm noticing the yellow vest movement being hijacked by right wing conservatives and pro oil groups. We need to be able to tell the difference, so a green plan isn't usurped by the same old forces of corporate greed. #astroturf
181 2018-12-19 23:43:29 No one was blaming Notley for the price of oil.  They were blaming her for not reacting to market forces, hiring anti oil boards and policy and regulations that helped shut down the industry
182 2018-12-19 23:43:25 North Korea is a small country which doesn't have things like domestic oil production, making it susceptible to embargoes on necessary goods, and had all of its industry wiped out during the deliberate U.S. bombing of civilian infrastructure during the Korean War.
183 2018-12-19 23:43:13 Not really, remember that the Boko Haram in Nigeria initially was just a Nigerian affair, ignored by Nigeria's neighbors but now expanded and extended to those countries. And it's now kind of a business franchise with no end in sight. Kind of Northern Nigeria's oil well.
184 2018-12-19 23:43:08 Their dirty energy premier seems to be unaware that it was US oil companies that were funding that campaign ostensibly to depress bitumen prices. The oil from the area around LA is some of the dirtiest crude anywhere and no one says anything about that

187 2018-12-19 23:42:46 *filling out my DBT workbook*
wait i can just smoke an oil?
188 2018-12-19 23:42:37 Khadafi died because he wanted to start selling oil for currencies other that the federal reserve note. Fractional reserve banking is the problem.  Gold ends the fed
189 2018-12-19 23:42:37 I just got a stress relief oil in my advent calendar. Someone out there knew just what's needed the last 5 days before christmas 
190 2018-12-19 23:42:35 You, as a Londoner (from your bio) will have the effects of your Brexit reduced by trading Scotland's fishing rights, your balance of trade will be cushioned by our exports, and your pound will be strengthened by our oil. Lots of good stuff for you, lots of shit for us. Selfish.
191 2018-12-19 23:42:27 I don't think there is any relation. Hunt's foods came out of California, Lamar and his family were oil tycoons in East Texas.
192 2018-12-19 23:42:25 Our politicians in Canada pushed a citizen to be this outspoken.

If they had acted instead of digging up the oil sands - THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF RIGHT NOW!

Then there is everything that CANADA has put me through. 

YOU DESTROYED MY LIFE AND THEN NEGLECT, ABANDONED, FOUGHT

196 2018-12-19 23:41:51 I dunno, the spread has ticked up a bit but nothing yet compared to 2016. And how much of the uptick is oil? I don't know, but I'd like to.
197 2018-12-19 23:41:48 The US is an illegal occupier of a sovereign country. They only occupied the area where oil is located. Syrians will celebrate when they leave.
198 2018-12-19 23:41:44 Pete is obviously an oil painting  I’ve secretly had a crush since you joined the street  lol

201 2018-12-19 23:41:18 Livestock twitter: we feed animals the waste products from soy oil production.

Narrator: Per bushel oil is worth about $4.50, the “waste” about $7

Winston Smith must have interned at big beef inc.
202 2018-12-19 23:41:18 That's in the past we have to look forward. indeed oil doesn't help.
i have a model for predicting forward EPS and CL4 (long dated oil) is the biggest factor. i assume many other macro traders have the same model and a 30% drop in oil has implications for them

204 2018-12-19 23:41:00 “Our Oil and Gas sector contributes more to Canada’s GDP than the auto sector, forestry, mining or aerospace sectors...” Marty Hall Findlay, P/CEO, CAD West Foundation
205 2018-12-19 23:40:57 You've made a lot of bad decisions but this is the worst of them all. Americans have helped SDF secure Eastern Syria and the majority of oil fields in Syria. We are now abandoning everything American have died to achieve to the Russians because you're a coward? Longterm mindset!!
206 2018-12-19 23:40:52 You people are out here getting lash extensions and losing all your lashes when you could just put some castor oil on them for the fraction of the price and grow them yourself smh
207 2018-12-19 23:40:40 My two cents. We run out of oil, coal, gas. There will be wars. We run out of sun none of that matters. I'm putting my money on solar.
208 2018-12-19 23:40:37 People in West Texas talk a lot about oil traffic and speed but red light runners are worse in Midland and Odessa than anywhere I have ever seen. Sometimes up to 7 cars will run a red light in a row. A red light without at least 2 or 3 runners is extremely rare.
209 2018-12-19 23:40:20 Naaa, we're trapped in the elite agenda to kill off 95% of us, the oil sludge suckers knew from the beginning they could use CO2 to kill us all off.

Couple hundred million$ bought the GOP and convinced them Scientist reports on reality were fake, CO2 is good...

212 2018-12-19 23:39:58 Those bitching fans money worth less than the ones accepting mediocrity? Squeaky wheel gets the oil
213 2018-12-19 23:39:53 Dunno.. earnings up 25% yoy.. new highs in profit margins and new highs in aggregate wages ( = spending power ).. biggest risk is oil IMHO..
214 2018-12-19 23:39:51 16 years of being told interventionism and "killing brown people for oil," is wrong. Now this.

Seriously WTF?
215 2018-12-19 23:39:48 I'll go half way, a factory of robots where there are a few people who oil the gears because they have no choice 
216 2018-12-19 23:39:44 Crimbot sick ? Can’t be, just need an oil change and good to go! need these scrims fam
217 2018-12-19 23:39:38 I’ve never been more proud to be an Albertan than at todays show of oil and gas demonstration in Nisku.  @AndrewScheer gets us! Time for @JustinTrudeau to dust off the teaching resume
218 2018-12-19 23:39:22 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
219 2018-12-19 23:39:21 You'll be back soon, ISIS is growing in Iraq and when they go for the oil the Kurds won't do the dirty job again. Congratulations to Turkey Russia Iran and Hezbollah
220 2018-12-19 23:39:16 I don't actually remember ever being in a nativity play, although I'm sure I was. The only two school play roles I remember being were Generic Dictator with Moustache #3 (I think Saddam Hussein was the intended look), and a literal snake oil salesman in the old west.
221 2018-12-19 23:39:08 They are leaving their partners for dry to the Turks. They give lucrative oil fields near al-tanf to Assad's regime and as a result Russia. They give Iran a ground pathway from Tehran-Damascus-Beirut. A nightmare for Israel when it comes to ground weapon movements.
222 2018-12-19 23:38:58 You know why? Because victims are precieved to be equally to blame as the perp for the violence. A situation of “oil & water” Can’t mix the two, that’s all. Versus everyone knows a dog is innocent.
223 2018-12-19 23:38:45 He makes a living making stupid remarks like that about oil!! there is no clean oil, all oils are dirty but they going be around for more years to come!!
224 2018-12-19 23:38:44 Today @realDonaldTrump surrendered Syria to Russia. The authoritarian Assad regime is under Putin’s control and Trump has surrendered one of the world’s richest supplies of oil to them. #ImpeachTrumpNow
225 2018-12-19 23:38:44 Everything that is petroleum based can be made with hemp oil & other hemp products. Paper, plastic, textiles, rope, fuel, cosmetics & yes, roads & homes built with hemp fibers & hemp-crete, a substance that is sturdier than concrete. Hemp also nourishes soil & air.
226 2018-12-19 23:38:38 …also I apparently have intestines of steel and really don’t get too many reactions beyond my usual/known canola oil and pork, so I avoid those things now.
227 2018-12-19 23:38:36 I said look at his fundraising as a whole and measure the amount from oil/gas. It’s a proportionately low amount. When you are the number 1 fundraiser in almost all areas of work, the amount given by employees of oil and gas industries is small.
228 2018-12-19 23:38:36 Where there’s oil, you’ll find Rubio.
229 2018-12-19 23:38:32 nope, money talks.
oil money talks louder.
230 2018-12-19 23:38:27 Hey, @AndrewScheer, is blocking traffic all over Edmonton really the best way to protest a low energy market? Wouldn't it be better to load those trucks with oil and ship it to the coast? #yegtraffic #abpoli
231 2018-12-19 23:38:21 They are going about 5 k/h on the henday. Entire south side is blocked. I feel like they are saying “ let’s piss off an entire city that already supports oil and gas”
232 2018-12-19 23:38:18 I am so thankful that you watch FOX and post these clips. Last time I saw FOX was while I was getting my oil changed. 

Another woman in the lobby demanded the station be changed-and the dude was like ‘sure lady, I never watch this shot either’.
233 2018-12-19 23:38:11 thank u this makes a lot of sense 
so if my skin is really dry that could be why?? overproduction of oil to make up for it, clogging my dam pores?
234 2018-12-19 23:38:10 I think you’re rather missing my point. I largely agree with you. But the notion that the opposition is trying to promulgate, if the current government is somehow responsible for the current and entirely predictable downturn in the oil patch, is nonsense and political pandering.
235 2018-12-19 23:38:09 Well what a surprise the government doesn't want President Trump to pull our troops out of the middle East makes you wonder doesn't it what do they have in mind o yeah that's right oil.
236 2018-12-19 23:38:02 I voted remain, but common sense tells me either way there will be winners and losers. The economy of any country is like an oil tanker, to alter its fundamental course quickly just will not happen Brexit or no Brexit
237 2018-12-19 23:38:02 Oil spot sign? psoriatic arthritis?
238 2018-12-19 23:37:56 Oil can be sourced from other countries.
239 2018-12-19 23:37:54 have you tried CBD oil? It does great things for me. word of warning: RESEARCH the sellers. It's the wild west out there and some of the companies are dodgy and include Bad Things in their oil.
240 2018-12-19 23:37:47 Another Fake News report.  Why are you blaming “palm oil” when you clearly state Borneo’s handling of the oil is your problem?  Do you wish to hurt Florida or Indonesian palm oil producers?  What an irresponsible headline.  If I were you, I’d find another publisher.
241 2018-12-19 23:37:26 They still have NATO air support, minus the US. Though they would eventually fold fighting in the north and the south. Russia may well do another deal with Turkey to avoid conflict: Turkey gets the Kurds, Syria keeps the oil.
242 2018-12-19 23:37:18 I was on that oil grind for a while and it does wonders.
243 2018-12-19 23:37:14 Bugger that. Literally about to listen to "oil" again as I drift off...
244 2018-12-19 23:37:13 Why couldn't they buy oil from the North Sea or the Gulf Coast instead?

Not that your alternative wouldn't be better in the long run.
245 2018-12-19 23:36:59 Does #kratom show up in urine drug screens? What abt #cbd oil? Not UAs sent to a lab, but done in a Pain clinic. I’m wondering if it would help my mom. She’s in WA state where #marijuana is legal medically & recreationally, but her loser of a PM MD won’t allow it. Thanks.
246 2018-12-19 23:36:51 AIPAC isn't happy that Trump is leaving Syria!
Because Israel is drilling oil, from a land that belongs to
Syria. Trump is showing a lot of courage!
247 2018-12-19 23:36:48 Arab oil money
248 2018-12-19 23:36:45 Looking like the Oil folks missed ONE OF YOUR PAYMENTS !Nincompoop
249 2018-12-19 23:36:23 Because currently our infrastructure is set up to favour gas cars, with few charging stations and a hefty price tag on new cars.

It's almost like the solution is investing money into making electric cars more affordable and user friendly, 
Not doubling down on oil, again.
250 2018-12-19 23:36:20 Everyone come in and give me your fucking money and I will take off 10 dollars on your oil change
251 2018-12-19 23:36:14 Try reading. There’s this thing called Google where the facts all hide together in plain sight...please check it out, and get your inbred Fox watching friends to do the same. WAKE UP-Trump is a narcissistic snake oil salesman-nothing more!
252 2018-12-19 23:36:12 Eiiiiii sista Lynda plz mama say I shud ask if u won’t use oil for ur cooking? Plz I’m just asking for ma mom oo
253 2018-12-19 23:36:11 To get fully fat adapted, it'll take a good 2-3 months so try to stick with it to see the best results :-)

Also, MCT (C8) oil is like rocket fuel for the body and mind when you're in ketosis. Tiny amounts though to begin with, as you will shit yourself.
254 2018-12-19 23:36:03 Not any of them push oil tycoon as a career
255 2018-12-19 23:36:00 And a bit more of draught, expensive water, expensive food. The far-right-extremists will take over and do what they always do, then wars will start, civilisation will decay, no internet --> far less food, no oil and gas, misery and all.
256 2018-12-19 23:35:54 Isnt that just via breakevens? On the growth side will be interesting to see when US oil production comes off as a result of the oil price decline. Still rising as of recent weeks
257 2018-12-19 23:35:53 Does anyone know if using cbd oil for body aches during pregnancy is bad ? Or have any of you tried it. Or someone please tell me what helps with backaches bc I’m dying 
258 2018-12-19 23:35:45 I did for a while, but nothing beats a solid wooden comb. Maybe a little oil/balm if it's too crazy/dry
259 2018-12-19 23:35:44 Fish analogy doesn’t fit here. Use the govt funding to learn skills for a new profession that doesn’t depend on such a volatile market.

They haven’t blocked anything. Quebec imports >50% of its oil from Alberta.
260 2018-12-19 23:35:40 Can someone just send me oil for my pen for Xmas. Thank you 
261 2018-12-19 23:35:37 Buzzfeed: Google is marketing apps to kids that share personal data with third parties, show manipulative ads, and are rife with creepy images — from graphic plucking of eyelashes to rubbing oil on scantily clad pregnant women — according to a new review.
262 2018-12-19 23:35:29 That includes people in the oil and gas sector, right? 

On the point of what oil has afforded us, we have a MAJOR plastic pollution issue around the world thanks to oil. Good stuff eh?
263 2018-12-19 23:35:20 As I said before .
Have at it . Do your part and stop using oil related products.
264 2018-12-19 23:35:20 Why?  Vibranium. The magic meteor. All their tech is based on it and made from it. They get their energy from it. They don’t need to export it to have value and generate wealth. It’s like having oil mixed with steel and plastic. It’s magic. It makes no sense, but there it is.
265 2018-12-19 23:35:12 how to explain that every orifice in your body exerts oil
266 2018-12-19 23:35:06 ‘bougie on main’ is the arts world equivalent to being horny on main

instead of being caught w porn in your likes it’s tweeting about how the £60 bottle of olive oil you just picked reminds you of the olive press you summered at while you wrote your first poetry collection
267 2018-12-19 23:35:05 RT @LS_Nutrition: #Safflower Oil this December? It can interact with #Anticoagulant, #Antiplatelet and other drugs. Check with your #MD!
268 2018-12-19 23:35:02 I need some type of oil 4 my beard
269 2018-12-19 23:34:34 It also murders brown people so the white folks can make money by controlling the world's oil.

You want to show me a picture of the Death Star next?

For the cost of one of those murder machines how many people could have gotten an education, life saving treatment, clean water?
270 2018-12-19 23:34:23 Pure hype and snake oil.
271 2018-12-19 23:34:16 David wouldn't that take the blocking of all oil imports. Irving can refine Brent oil from North Sea and US light oil from the Gulf Coast as two examples I know of. 

I agree with your sentiment on NB jobs though.
272 2018-12-19 23:33:56 Alberta lost 100k jobs since 2015

Yes we are part of Canada and I believe that should remain

We also have agriculture/beef and lumber

However oil is our big one
And employs everyone from hotel clerks to safety inspectors
273 2018-12-19 23:33:56 Equate that with economic impact on the food bills , if the farmers stop cultivation due to continuous losses, then may be our food import bills will be higher than the oil imports bill , the sector is also the largest employers, where are the jobs ? Otherwise
274 2018-12-19 23:33:54 Never happen. It is politically a nonstarter. Oil Conservatives are driving this nonsense. Even oil executives are arguing for climate controls. This “movement” is defined by its disdain for the climate and for immigration. History will not look at it kindly.
275 2018-12-19 23:33:53 This cold is trying to make a comeback... Zicam and oregano oil to the rescue. 
276 2018-12-19 23:33:47 Arctic Circle:
1. Arctic Ocean claims should b as per international law. 100 miles off the coast. Anything beyond that shouldn’t matter cuz there will b a moratorium on any further oil/gas exploration above the Arctic Circle. We need Climate Action ASAP
277 2018-12-19 23:33:47 I want to thank all the people that I’ve bought car parts for while working on their cars, you have helped me rack up enough @autozone points for a $9 oil change with filter. @Valvoline #MaxLife #YourMechanicFriend @JoelMenken
278 2018-12-19 23:33:41 The thesis is that those in the #akleg who thought oil prices would save us were wrong, that Walker handed off a bogus budget, and that he's not backing down from paying a PFD according to the formula on the books. Didn't think it was that complicated.
279 2018-12-19 23:33:32 Alhamdulillah, Allah ya bada zaman lfy ya sanya alheri.
280 2018-12-19 23:33:29 My guess is that Rotterdam will see as much liquefied CO2 heading for #NorthSea storage with enhanced gas and oil recovery as Calgary will see heading for Wiliston Basin storage with enhanced oil recovery using the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line #ACTL #CCUS #EOR
281 2018-12-19 23:33:20 @Valvoline Kevin at the Des Moines, IA Southside outlet gave me the most professional, pleasant, and informative oil change ever! I’m very happy with the experience.
282 2018-12-19 23:33:18 Exactly, nothing is or will be resolved in the middle east until we become independent of oil. In the end all this America posturing has little to do with terrorism and more to do with oil.
283 2018-12-19 23:33:18 It's a long list from allowing illegal immigrants to landlocking Alberta's oil to crippling carbon taxes about to be imposed. He's an empty suit, I'm a moderate when it comes to politics so you know.
284 2018-12-19 23:33:11 More extra virgin oil in the Brexit pyre. She is just adding more fuel  to the confusion that already exist in a precarious form!!
285 2018-12-19 23:33:00 Curbing #methane emissions puts WA communities & the environment at risk from potential leaks of greenhouse gases from oil & gas producers. I joined my colleagues to call on @EPAAWheeler to protect existing @EPA methane rules and to work to strengthen clean air standards.
286 2018-12-19 23:32:55 Yeah, taking an authoritarian stance with China would go over well. Like closing the barn door after the horses have bolted, throwing the baby out with the bath water, Alberta separating to get their oil to Tidewater seamlessly. Need I go on?
287 2018-12-19 23:32:50 Seems to me a more effective way of getting a message through would be to inconvenience the flow of traffic in the provinces that are blocking the pipelines. What use is it to block traffic in the city and province that are trying everything to get oil flowing?
288 2018-12-19 23:32:42 Well - they are using a lot more gas and oil, and so is everyone stuck on the road so there's that... #idontgetit
289 2018-12-19 23:32:28 Thinking we can invest in green energy or even our social programs or infrastructure in all provinces without the revenues generated by the oil sector is just plain naive
290 2018-12-19 23:32:21 Quem sabe não dá compra em alguns meses? Que venha o oil de $30!!!
291 2018-12-19 23:32:18 I’m old enough to remember when SNL was funny and lower Oil prices were good for the economy.
292 2018-12-19 23:32:18 I don't understand the problem. Everything is getting cheaper. TV's are cheaper, Cars are cheaper, Labor is cheaper. Oil is cheaper. What else? Help me out here.
293 2018-12-19 23:32:06 Sneezed about 30 times in past hour and half, I better not be coming down with a cold just before Christmas dosed up on sudafed, cold and flu tablets, vitamins, olbas oil, vapour rub and nasal spray, fml
294 2018-12-19 23:32:06 Well, at least I got a 20 dollar coupon off of my oil change  thanks pep boys!  she doesn’t need anything else.
295 2018-12-19 23:31:59 It was all fine until reality hit. For people who are all about oil there is little knowledge of how the industry works. Makes them easy to manipulate. Any support I had for this crew was destroyed with their utter stupidity of blaming @RachelNotley for the world price of oil.
296 2018-12-19 23:31:59 pretty piffed I waited 23 years to try a coconut oil hair mask but definitely not piffed at how freaking soft my hair is right now  
297 2018-12-19 23:31:42 If it's the oil I found for me the strain did not matter those are the terpenes which I don't know a lot about all I know is I could pick a sativa or indica or hybrid IF IT IS in an OIL FORM it all worked 4me the SAME. My delivery service ppl educated me.

299 2018-12-19 23:31:22 Pretty sure my ma knows I'm a ganja girl after having an in depth conversation with her fella about the differences between CBD oil and smoking 
300 2018-12-19 23:31:19 According to CBC: “Truckers for Pipelines is organizing a convoy that will take vehicles to that meeting and is encouraging trucks of all shapes and sizes to "come out to show support for the Canadian oil and gas industry and Canadian families from coast to coast”
301 2018-12-19 23:31:18 I probably won’t get any love but bring Hakan. It’s time to oil up Capcom.
302 2018-12-19 23:31:02 Funny thing is, most of the oil heading into those Quebec refineries is Canadian. Zero Saudi oil. I think the big thing is they don't want pipelines that threaten drinking water sources, and running through neighborhoods.
303 2018-12-19 23:30:48 The good trade surplus dropped from $2b to just $451m mainly due to high oil prices during the year. So the overall Deficit is due to an ‘invisibles’ of nearly $11b ( payments for financial services, o/s company profits, interest paid to foreigners).
304 2018-12-19 23:30:45 bcos you have alot of good oil in your system
305 2018-12-19 23:30:44 Irelivant. And I disagree with u on Fossil fuels in particular.

They had huge coal reserves n substantial oil n gas.

Infact o & g north sea saved  their ass in the 80s
306 2018-12-19 23:30:35 I searched out Alberta dum dum 
Your dumb post was on it.. found it amusing and flawed
I responded 

And duh... everyone uses oil some how... that’s not denial ... that’s fact

308 2018-12-19 23:30:27 I'm from Ontario I believe my Western brothers and sisters cannot be bribed by this globalist elitist leader! This is not only about oil and Pipelines this is about the future of our country Eastern Canada can learn something from the West. It's not always about money!

Rise up
309 2018-12-19 23:30:14 This is the kind of thinking we need.  We did not ask for a bailout with our own money I might add.  Let us use and build pipelines.  If not stop oil and transfer payments. Let’s see how boy wonder bails our Quebec.
310 2018-12-19 23:30:12 Not the pink oil moisturizer. Like penicillin and Vaseline.
311 2018-12-19 23:30:11 Taking mineral oil laxatives?
312 2018-12-19 23:30:11 More AMERICAN jobs long term growth. US the largest supplier and producer of oil and natural gas. Take that Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran. I guess the whole BS Collusion thing falling apart Russsian economy 100% depends on oil export #AmericaFirst 
313 2018-12-19 23:30:06 @RobinsonCarol I just heard about a shootout on University in front of Express Oil Change. Have you heard anything: injuries/fatalities?
314 2018-12-19 23:30:03 Lowkey obsessed with Bath and body works. Go in looking for some good smelling lotion. Leave with 3 candles, oil defusers, and lotions. Shits expensive too.
315 2018-12-19 23:29:59 Meanwhile in China, where growth is slowing, and they are using less oil and buying less cars, and when they do buy cars, are buying more electric cars are like: Who's "Alberta"?
316 2018-12-19 23:29:57 #oxo why do you have palm oil in your stock? Plenty of environmentally unharmful oils you could use
317 2018-12-19 23:29:45 Where do you get your facts? Rail is hardly declining as an industry, and has been on the rise since the 80’s driven in part by intermodal traffic from Pacific ports to the east and crude oil in the Balkans.
318 2018-12-19 23:29:26 @FredFaour there’s an oil rig 18 miles off the Florida keys that they made into a casino
319 2018-12-19 23:28:53 Brb learning how to change oil 
320 2018-12-19 23:28:50 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 6 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

321 2018-12-19 23:28:48 It’s likely that the US withdrawal is the outcome of a US/Ottoman, post-Khashoggi agreement: Turkey will dump Russia and S-400 & returns to US lap in return of annexation of oil/gas-rich part of Syria by the Ottomans.
322 2018-12-19 23:28:39 This is about as big of a #fakenews story she’s telling u as there is out there. Yes Oil industry is an option but these would be extremist views
323 2018-12-19 23:28:32 ตอนแรกตามเพราะแจกของเลยค่ แงงง อย่าว่าน้องงงงน๊าา แต่มาตอนนี้ก็ตามเพราะรีวิวเด้ออออ 
324 2018-12-19 23:28:13 Solar will not be cheaper than gas until oil becomes scarce or we simply cannot pull more of it out of the ground cheaply. We have proven we can keep oil and clean water separate. Rebuilding roads takes significant energy. The BTU's needed to do so is cheaper via fossil fuels.
325 2018-12-19 23:28:12 We should use oil with great care & efficiency.
326 2018-12-19 23:27:54 Not only will they pack garbage, they will pack household cleaning products.  You do not want this, unless you’re fond of cleaning up items soaked in bleach, laundry detergent, or furniture oil.
327 2018-12-19 23:27:44 I don't think that's the case. Should Asad regime hold onto power, you will see Russia and them be likely allies, but so what? Russia will buy their oil, and give its military equipment. This in an of itself, is not a threat to the US.
328 2018-12-19 23:27:40 Google Vivian Krause if you want to learn more about US based foundations and the “tar sands campaign “ among other de marketing campaigns they have ran in against salmon and oil , lumber industries
329 2018-12-19 23:27:29 I hope you took out his oil pan when he ran over you! 
330 2018-12-19 23:27:27 Which Syria?

The Syria after 1967 war without the Golan Heights oil rich reserves stolen by Israel?

Or Syria before 1967?
331 2018-12-19 23:27:18 Maybelline eye + lip makeup remover, L'oreal extraordinary oil
332 2018-12-19 23:27:16 Yeah and that’s where capitalism is wrong, because it’s relentless in its search for profit, it overlooks environmental issues such as concerning the removal of oil, cracking and spillages. But most of the negative consequences happen in 3rd world countries not UK
333 2018-12-19 23:27:15 The bottom 60% sacrifice plenty in a social-political-economic sense.

But we may need to consume less meat, use less water and private transportation, have fewer children, etc.

We need Brazil not to destroy its rainforest, and to use less oil. This may mean suppt. Brz/Ven/Saud.
334 2018-12-19 23:27:12 You got enough oil and minerals so war is over! You win to gain
335 2018-12-19 23:27:02 And would drive Irving Oil out of the country. Is that the @CPC_HQ goal?
336 2018-12-19 23:26:59 Appears as though WeakAndy would rather sacrifice 85% of our GDP to Fight for 15% derived from Western oil. Oblivious to needs of the rest of Canada. #ManufacturedOutrage doesn't make for Sound Public Policy
337 2018-12-19 23:26:55 Jo is often dismissed as 'corrupt' and in the pay of big oil.  Yet she used to raise money for the Greens and used to talk about AGW on the radio as a science communicator.  Alarmists are really nasty in their attacks on her...how dare anybody leave the 'Church'!
338 2018-12-19 23:26:51 Couldn’t have anything to do with the almost 100,000 barrels oil consumed daily?
339 2018-12-19 23:26:46 I have an oil diffuser at my desk now and I feel so boujee
340 2018-12-19 23:26:37 The rich get richer, the poor get screwed. Living is like oil, it gets crude
341 2018-12-19 23:26:32 Why a party pooper? Other great provinces to live in if u don’t like Oil industry...
342 2018-12-19 23:26:24 Basically, you have to be legal to destroy the environment in order to NOT call it a threat.  Because it seems that you are now an environmental activist but when it involves fracking, oil pipelines, etc. your rant is towards those who oppose it.
343 2018-12-19 23:26:16 Baby oil and baking soda!

345 2018-12-19 23:25:56 He is just selling snake oil to his base.
346 2018-12-19 23:25:53 In a way, you're right here. If we keep on sucking the fossil fuel teet, you and I and our grandkids *will* all be dead before we stop using oil in society.

But so will everyone else, so that's neat. 

And also, yes! Let's close all the Walmarts.
Grand idea!

350 2018-12-19 23:25:22 Oh,he's someone to love,huh?They do know he shoved his baby daughters down an 8 inch oil tank lid?
351 2018-12-19 23:25:08 Ahhhh. If Alberta was its own country, it would still be landlocked, and unable to get more oil to tidewater???
352 2018-12-19 23:25:04 My names monet but I don’t own any kind of oil paintings by Claude monet?://
353 2018-12-19 23:25:04 @realDonaldTrump Just FYI.... oil prices NEED to be, AT A MINIMUM, $65-70 /bbl. Otherwise, there will be lay-off's galore in the oil & gas industry. Please realize this. It is the only topic I disagree with you on. We can't sustain ourselves lower than that.

355 2018-12-19 23:24:42 Okay...how many of you out CBD oil on your Christmas list?
356 2018-12-19 23:24:41 You disrespect them by lying about the US and war. By conning them into thinking they’re dying for “liberty” when they’re dying for cheap oil.
357 2018-12-19 23:24:38 Why we don't have a Canadian energy security policy is beyond me. Canadian oil processed in Canadian refineries sold to Canadians. I thought that PetroCanada was supposed to do that? Canada needs to stop being the worlds raw materials store.
358 2018-12-19 23:24:38 #ClimateHysterians love to accuse skeptics of "Gish Galloping"; it's part of their worldview in which they are the most enlightened people in the conversation. They've invented a whole lexicon for ridiculing people who don't buy their snake oil.
359 2018-12-19 23:24:38 I hate to say this but you are probably right. If they raise the rates enough now, then when Big Oil or another bubble tries to tank our economy we will have room to lower rates.
360 2018-12-19 23:24:35 Wonder where the money's coming for all this? Foreign-owned oil operations, maybe? Why are foreigners influencing policy?
361 2018-12-19 23:24:31 It would be awesome if they would challenge their provincial government and the activists blocking Canadian oil from Alberta. Real people can make change, we need to speak up.
362 2018-12-19 23:24:15 Plastic and oil are related. Who knew? ROFLMMFAO
363 2018-12-19 23:24:10 Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil range is an absolute game changer
364 2018-12-19 23:23:57 Or, natural gas and oil are still much sweeter and the renewables have only helped us climb the ladder of demand to the forbidden fossil cupboard. 

Dunno, but interesting dynamics that seem worthy of more thought. The carbonization issue is a stumper.
365 2018-12-19 23:23:53 If oil keeps falling then lithium and ev will be squeezed by slow uptake.

367 2018-12-19 23:23:42 PMJT bought 1-pipeline for Albertans to get their oil to tidewater! In 10 years - Harper built -zero pipelines!  PMJT serious about Alberta oil!
368 2018-12-19 23:23:23 Naomi Lakritz - Over the years I have read many of Naomi Lakritz's columns, and agreed with her often. Her latest regarding the pipeline, oil business protest had to be written under the influence of a snipe, or worse. Naomi labeled the protestors as terrorist fringe looneys!

373 2018-12-19 23:22:19 Truth. But my problems will be from 20 years in Fort Lauderdale when all you could find on the shelves was oil

376 2018-12-19 23:21:52 Triangles! Everywhere there’s triangles!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
377 2018-12-19 23:21:37 Especially when oil wealth funding means normal social control mechanisms can be subverted and circumvented.
378 2018-12-19 23:21:31 Every new clip from the east talking about dirty oil, and blocking our ability to support this country. Every dollar taken by the east. Every hurting Albertan. What more do you want?
379 2018-12-19 23:21:10 How do they raise and donate some oil sector type of money 
380 2018-12-19 23:21:09 Also, if you go to one of those stores that makes fresh olive oil and vinegar, it is an amazing experience, there is so much complexity of flavor, it's amazing, truly.
381 2018-12-19 23:20:51 Then quit driving and using oil and gas
382 2018-12-19 23:20:50 Now playing Cover You In Oil by AC/DC!
383 2018-12-19 23:20:38 Yes. Refined oil has an expiration date. We refine it here in New Brunswick Canada & ship it to the states. Why can’t Alberta do this too? It’s made Irving one of the richest families in Canada.
384 2018-12-19 23:20:24 Ce type de véhicule est absurde pour vous, pour d'autres, c'est un outil de travail.
385 2018-12-19 23:20:15 Pan seared. Coat the fish with Sesame seed oil, shake on sesame seeds. Pan seared med/high heat with 2tbsp of butter. 3 min per side for the seared outside raw cold middle
386 2018-12-19 23:20:11 There will be no pharacare without or until the oil sector rebounds. Anyone who says differently is lying to you.
387 2018-12-19 23:20:07 Silky, are u looking for a bounce in SPX today? Do u have a chart on oil and SPX?
388 2018-12-19 23:20:02 They pissed away the heritage fund while oil was 100+ bucks a barrel SMH!!!!!!
389 2018-12-19 23:20:00 I soooooo agree with you. @realDonaldTrump was just a big clown in NY constantly going into bankruptcy. The country fell for his snake oil pitch because they wanted to. I still dont understand how people are still defending his BS
390 2018-12-19 23:19:55 U.S economic growth has been strong and unemployment rate remains at a 49-year low. But inflation has softened in recent months, and falling oil prices 
391 2018-12-19 23:19:40 U.S economic growth has been strong and unemployment rate remains at a 49-year low. But inflation has softened in recent months, and falling oil prices 
392 2018-12-19 23:19:34 "dO yOU UsE OiL?"
You just hit climate change denier bingo!

By the way, you literally searched out my tweet and jumped into my mentions. You don't follow me, we have no mutuals. You're just out looking for a fight with strangers.

So yeah....one of us is a child (hint: it's you)
393 2018-12-19 23:19:30 Hardly fair is it....Now on to the business at hand. Since you and Putin made a backroom deal with Isreal to withdraw US troops let Russia take over and Highly profit from Oil And Gas Pipeline region of Syria &give Isreal back its Gonesh region
394 2018-12-19 23:19:16 Contrairement à ce que l'on peut croire, un RAM 5.7 (et ses cousins de chez GM ou ford) ne pollue pas plus qu'un renault Master ou un Range Rover.
395 2018-12-19 23:19:13 Italian BMT on Italian Herbs and Cheese with pepper jack cheese, onions, spinach, banana peppers vinegar and oil
396 2018-12-19 23:19:13 Dying industry...? Unless you live naked in the forest, you are using oil products. The tires on your car are an oil product, the shoes on your feet are an oil product. Oil has done nothing but diversify over the years.
397 2018-12-19 23:19:12 it's like voting for a douche bag for his snake oil promises and then it bites you in the ass.
And isn't it ironic? Don't cha think?
a little too ironic...

400 2018-12-19 23:19:07 Yes it is oil based.
401 2018-12-19 23:18:47 How does screwing up traffic on the Henday at rush hour in a town already pro oil and gas ‘stick it to Ottawa?” Asking for a guy that NEEDS the Henday to get home.
402 2018-12-19 23:18:32 So a lot of girls ask me how I get my crazy curly hair to look so healthy and soft when I straighten it so imma let y’all in on my secret... Hella conditioner (a curly girls bff) and coconut oil. And quit washing your hair everyday. :)
403 2018-12-19 23:18:17 I was merely pointing out that, what in hindsight, is now very obvious
Was not so at the time

"When I looked into his eyes and saw his soul, Russia was broke. I mean,  short-term broke. And ah, the price of oil goes up and Putin changed,"  George Bush
404 2018-12-19 23:18:14 From one coast to another  , off shore platforms  , Natl Parks and Monuments  land deals taking more than half of OUR land for privatization  , for sale to highest foreign bidders and to be crowned #1 in world oil production  , Coal and other resources mined
405 2018-12-19 23:18:11 You can use it to compel witnesses — like oil, gas, and coal execs — to testify at hearings and powerfully drive public discussion and build support for effective legislation. I think.
406 2018-12-19 23:18:09 woulda take them outta the hot oil same way suh
407 2018-12-19 23:18:08 I use the coconut oil for their scalp it works magic literally no jam gel none of that shit going in my kids head that’s out
408 2018-12-19 23:18:07 Yes you can pick some up at the drugstore or make some at home with sugar + coconut oil.
409 2018-12-19 23:18:06 Not one of Brando’s best, he’s only in like 3 scenes. George C Scott is main character investigating a conspiracy about a synthetic fuel developed by the Germans in WW2 that the oil companies will murder to keep from the public. Marlon got paid.

411 2018-12-19 23:17:54 We in New York knew all about his mob ties. Enough not to vote for him. Rest of country in love with empty promises of snake oil con man.
412 2018-12-19 23:17:42 and @michellerempel 
This is as intelligent as offering Alberta $1.6 billion dollars to help the oil industry. When will Canada smarten up and just build a pipeline. Handouts are not needed.
413 2018-12-19 23:17:41 "Darth Vader" Cheney was the mastermind of the Iraq War, recall when before the war he held a secret meeting with all oil Executives? Talk about reading a book, this one could be read by a blind man.
414 2018-12-19 23:17:40 Seriously.   Bad economic policy and greed caused inflation earlier in the year with oil.  Lower demand and change in OPEC stemmed that for the time being.   The fed needed to raise rates.  What you don't get is the crutch from the crisis has to be removed.  This is part of it.
415 2018-12-19 23:17:38 For the past seven years, since my dad died. Every Christmas, one family from church always buys Rice, Oil etc for our family. God Bless them honestly

417 2018-12-19 23:17:35 Not funny @ all. Went to Aba! PH Aba expressway is better imagined than experienced right this moment.Recall that today was Oil Mill Market? My body telephone me, no be small!
418 2018-12-19 23:17:31 おはたえです~(｀∀´)
419 2018-12-19 23:17:30 Foregoing all that foreign owned oil is contrary to all Pentagon objectives
420 2018-12-19 23:17:26 Dude you need oregano oil stat
421 2018-12-19 23:17:15 โดนตกอีกแล้ว 
422 2018-12-19 23:17:09 i’m frying chicken and i just touched the oil 
423 2018-12-19 23:16:54 Oil Dey ur head
424 2018-12-19 23:16:45 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
425 2018-12-19 23:16:42 as well as learning to integrate plastic, oil, corexit & plutonium into their diets.
426 2018-12-19 23:16:39 Yep, a UK thing. You can make them very easily, they're pretty much flour eggs milks and oil. Give them a go!
427 2018-12-19 23:16:37 Need to rally support of all Canadians! People need to flood MPs and Trudeau either by e-mail/letters whatever it takes to show Trudeau turning back on Alberta is not acceptable!  Remind him he is PM for ALL not just BC and Quebec! Build pipelines stop Saudi Arabia Oil!
428 2018-12-19 23:16:33 And yet the oil industry was doing just fine until 

1. Environmental and foreign funded groups started protesting pipelines
2. NDP came to power in AB 
3. Liberals swung far left under Trudeau and promised to shut down fossil fuel industry
429 2018-12-19 23:16:31 Ben, pourquoi n'aurait-il pas droit à un intérieur cuir ? Après tout, quand vous êtes au bureau, vous êtes assis sur une chaise, alors qu'un tabouret fait le même travail.
430 2018-12-19 23:16:31 To quote oil baroness and Bond girl-turned-Bond baddie Elektra King: “what’s the point in living, if you can’t feel alive?”
431 2018-12-19 23:16:30 i’ve tried weed, cbd oil, essential oils, imitrex, maxalt, supplements. i still get them. i got into this access program that gave me my first two for free & the second two for a $5 co pay. figured what could it hurt. will DEF let you know.
432 2018-12-19 23:16:25 I'm so fuckin mad I bought what I thought was oil painting t on Amazon only for it to arrive and it's fuckin "model" paint. Like I got some WW2 airplane toys I wanna color foh. Amazon always on some shit
433 2018-12-19 23:16:08 Hmmm, it's almost as if the US only ever considered the YPJ and "Rojava" as puppets in their attempt to remove the elected Assad government of Syria, and as a way to secure the oil in that part of the country. But that can't be true...Spanish Civil War and such
434 2018-12-19 23:16:05 But the Green New Deal takes away a lot of jobs for those who work in the oil industry. Without oil no more paved roads. Which means the unemployment rate goes up
435 2018-12-19 23:15:58 tea tree oil shampoo is the best
436 2018-12-19 23:15:49 Well you can account that Spain is the World's biggest producer and many Italians and French come over ,but wholesalers and stick a local name on it. Same applies for olive oil.....
437 2018-12-19 23:15:49 @gerarddeltell thanks for your presence in #yeg today showing support for CANADIAN oil and gas. I appreciated the discussion
438 2018-12-19 23:15:43 The U.K. is to oil and gas as Canada is to growing bananas. We are a resource based economy, they are not.
439 2018-12-19 23:15:33 I’m guessing you’ve got a safe place all furnished with plenty of guns and food for when the inevitable apocalypse happens as well? I’m Canadian, so I’m neither a Dem or GOP, but I can easily see you’ve elected a narcissistic snake oil salesman.
440 2018-12-19 23:15:31 US withdrawl from Syria looses sight of Russia's foothold in the area with a clear path for the Tehran-Mediterranean oil corridor from Iraq. History has been double crossed by granting Russia blanket control !
441 2018-12-19 23:15:24 @canpoli As I think about it, no one the reporting on it, the climate is everything, and Alberta is in a mess, keep it in the ground! End the oil economy....
442 2018-12-19 23:15:20 Leave me alone I didn’t have bottled oil 
443 2018-12-19 23:15:11 that shit with the tea tree oil that makes my scalp tingle. 2nd place L'oreal kids!
444 2018-12-19 23:15:09 Could be in part, but the counties with the most high earners in ND are really at the heart of the oil boom
445 2018-12-19 23:15:08 RT @LS_Nutrition: #Safflower Oil this December? It can interact with #Anticoagulant, #Antiplatelet and other drugs. Check with your #MD!
446 2018-12-19 23:15:06 Have Exon/Mobil pay for all or part of wall. Make pipe on top of design a natural gas or oil pipeline.
447 2018-12-19 23:15:05 Sana oil proud
448 2018-12-19 23:15:02 yess i had to put castor oil on them to make them grow back :(
449 2018-12-19 23:15:02 Ankle, shoulder, knee...I feel like the tin man when he needs someone to oil his joints.
450 2018-12-19 23:14:59 Seems like we just left Lucas Oil, but our full 2019 BOA Streaming Schedule is now available!
451 2018-12-19 23:14:58 Megan ur not supposed to ACTUALLY use cardboard and motor oil
452 2018-12-19 23:14:51 Sakit jud ang oil wengyaaa
453 2018-12-19 23:14:44 Somebody described Alberta as Canada's cat-they want in, they want out, they want back in but we still love them. Albertans have been screwed over by their low taxes, horrible PC governance, and world oil shenanigans. Blaming the libs is misguided and ignorant.
454 2018-12-19 23:14:35 People are complaining how slow the Henday is because of the pipeline protest. Imagine how slow your car would be without oil products?
455 2018-12-19 23:14:30 RT @environment: TSA has "significant weaknesses" when it comes to oil and gas pipeline physical and potato security in the U.S., a GAO repo…
456 2018-12-19 23:14:28 Vous comprenez, une BMW M5 ou une classe E AMG de 600 chevaux, ce n'est pas Climaticide. Les gaz lacrimogènes balancés sur les gilets jaunes, les blindés à Paris, ce n'est pas climaticide.
457 2018-12-19 23:14:23 Can't seriously compare ISIS presence west v. east of Euphrates. In latter, they controlled major urban centers *for yrs*, had access to stocks of cash & an oil trade operation, moved heavy weaponry via uninterrupted supply lines, recruited out of *millions* of locals, etc
458 2018-12-19 23:14:17 This will go over like a lead balloon . The TRAITOR TRUMP will find a way to halt this because it cuts into his Fossil Fuel Expansion Agenda  . His thousands of new oil drilling platforms  / pipelines to cover miles and miles from Alaska to as Arctic  ,
459 2018-12-19 23:14:16 If your words are crude  they not for me but just for you. Note the  Budget tradition as been based on expected oil sales majorly. You can't change that over night.
460 2018-12-19 23:14:08 Like hogs, cattle, milk, oil, wheat, or 80% of commodities?
461 2018-12-19 23:14:06 an oil change for Christmas would be tight

463 2018-12-19 23:13:59 It's all about the oil. And a battle between the United States and Russia on who will build and control a pipeline for crude oil.
464 2018-12-19 23:13:57 China makes deals and investments to guarantee its sources of supply of oil, minerals, & raw materials for its growth industries. USA doesn't really "invest"in SAmerica - USA funding is for drug eradication programs - a totally different objective.
465 2018-12-19 23:13:50 not tin foil, it's made of shitty plastic from the shitty oil industry!
466 2018-12-19 23:13:47 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
467 2018-12-19 23:13:43 おはようございますー! ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)
468 2018-12-19 23:13:38 i can smell the amount of burnt argan oil in this picture and i’m upset.
469 2018-12-19 23:13:36 HELLO WORLD, I FINISHED MY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AND GOT AN OIL CHANGE TODAY
470 2018-12-19 23:13:32 I love castor oil! It is pretty thick, so a little goes a long way. You might want to try Jamaican Black Castor oil too.
471 2018-12-19 23:13:31 You mean let Putin pump all that oil tax-free through Crimea, stolen from Ukraine, now owned by Russia. Putin may have subverted our government just to become the richest man in the world.
472 2018-12-19 23:13:27 And in an oil rich nation.
473 2018-12-19 23:13:15 Yep yep yep  i smell like aloe vera, shea butter, eco style w/ coconut oil and Creme of Nature  BOAW  #BlackTwitter
474 2018-12-19 23:12:58 You should go to Quebec but walk on your way there. Do not use anything that is powered by oil and gas
475 2018-12-19 23:12:46 “The Chamber’s report also makes clear the strategic importance of Canada’s natural resources sectors, and the economic necessity of getting Canada’s oil and gas resources to tidewater so they can reach global markets"

I bet the smoke came out of Perrin Beatty's  ears!
476 2018-12-19 23:12:41 Seducing Riva 101:
Truffle oil on anything.
477 2018-12-19 23:12:40 Hey SoCal tweeps! I'm giving the keynote @UCsantabarbara's solar symposium March 1, 2019. The symposium is part of the year-long Mellon Sawyer "Energy Justice in Global Perspective" seminar & connected w/events recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the Santa Barbara Oil Spill.
478 2018-12-19 23:12:27 I suppose you could become a state, but if all AB oil goes their now anyway would the difference be significant?
479 2018-12-19 23:12:23 Except there has been no actual plan on how that's supposed to be achieved. Just statements that it needs to be done with a bs time limit of "12 years" really all this deal will do is tax the fuck out of oil and make them and their lobbyist buddies rich.
480 2018-12-19 23:12:19 sugar + olive oil, use it for lip scrub.
481 2018-12-19 23:12:17 "The company is one of the province's largest employers, with interests in forestry, pulp and paper, transportation, oil refining and distribution, retail, media outlets and shipbuilding. Canadian Business magazine says the privately owned empire was thought to be worth..."
482 2018-12-19 23:12:14 the alberta separatist argument is premised on canada blocking alberta from getting its oil to market, which how does separating help that
483 2018-12-19 23:12:06 Hey dummy, we have no strategic interest in Syria. Now that we kicked ISIS a$$, it’s time to go. All Syria was about was a pipeline to Europe, and you all are the ones who always scream no war for oil. Such a hypocrite.
484 2018-12-19 23:12:04 Trudeau is disrupting the oil patch. It seems Brett loooooves disruptive government policy when he benefits, but hates it when it's against him.

If Brett is truly fighting for governments screwing industries, then Brett should support the taxi industry.
#cdnpoli #abpoli
485 2018-12-19 23:11:53 Indigenous bands are lining up to build better oil transmission infrastructure but are held back by ideological knee jerk federal policies by the current government.  Your argument of predatory capitalism is bullshit
486 2018-12-19 23:11:41 So wait, first it's "but just want to work", but then it's "we ALL NEED OIL", now it's "Canada doesn't pollute enough to matter". 

Looks like you're just another run of the mill climate change denier. Go sit in the corner with the flat-earthers and anti-vexers where you belong.
487 2018-12-19 23:11:38 even colors like Palm oil Red..
488 2018-12-19 23:11:34 They get their oil on a pipeline, line 9 from alberta via ontario
489 2018-12-19 23:11:34 we care when the oil wealth empowers dictatorships thereby reducing the hegemony of free countries. we only need to look how they treat their own citizens and ask if we want them to have more influence

496 2018-12-19 23:11:05 @HalftimeReport You are making too much sense. Great point on the Oil being down 40% to Fisher today on the show. Just tell us there is light at the end of the tunnel.
497 2018-12-19 23:11:01 or oil.
498 2018-12-19 23:10:59 Vous faites une fixation sur les pickups "de luxe", qui peuvent avoir une certaine utilité, en revanche, le fait que les derniers modèles BMW M, AMG, et Audi RS dépassent les 500ch, ce qui ne sert à rien, ne choque personne.

Les bobos parisiens ont à nouveau tout compris.
499 2018-12-19 23:10:58 Ah okay! Nice haul!  I was taking Performix multivitamin, biotin, probiotics, vitamin c, b12, magnesium, fish oil, soy isoflavones, Glucosamine, melatonin, and L Tyrosine at one point, but now I just take my multi, melatonin, and vitamin c. Lol

504 2018-12-19 23:10:36 Facts matter

Oil is needed... period

And will be until a fullgreen transition takes place

Decades from now

Sorrynotsorry
505 2018-12-19 23:10:35 My secondary love language is acts of service and my best friend is currently changing the oil in my car  

I feel the most loved
506 2018-12-19 23:10:31 He should be stopping purchase of oil! But no we will cause thousands to lose jobs and keep paying Saudi Arabia $17 BILLION.
507 2018-12-19 23:10:31 Norway has access to tide water though. Alberta current predicament is due to the glut in oil, wouldn’t blocking all non-US routes make that glut worse?

514 2018-12-19 23:10:04 Note to self get a oil change!
515 2018-12-19 23:09:58 I did too. After I was rejected by the military, I spent my time researching how the world's governments meddle & create constant conflict that benefits the war machine. Ppl would fight me & say Desert Storm wasn't about the oil. BS if it wasn't. Bush fam $ is oil $.
516 2018-12-19 23:09:53 It is time for Iran to stop terrorizing its own people, stop funding terrorist organizations, and start spending the oil revenue on its own people not funding Bashar Al-Asad to kill more Syrians! Iranian people suffer from poverty!
517 2018-12-19 23:09:49 Erdogan’s leverage is MBS. He hasn’t publicly released all the intel Turkey collected. Release the data, push US further from Saudi, Trump gets screwed out of holtel income, and future deals for oil money. Veniality at its finest.
518 2018-12-19 23:09:48 The international media has to see the true story that the majority of Canadians are unhappy with the globalist policies! Today a convoy of over 1100 oil field trucks drove to Edmonton to oppose Trudeau!!!
519 2018-12-19 23:09:41 JFC. Pro-oil people making the statement "but you NEED oil in your every day life" as if that's not the entire goddamn problem in the first place.

Like....y'all really think informing people we have a fossil fuel heavy lifestyle is new information.
520 2018-12-19 23:09:33 So these huge oil companies are pushing for the tax: so they can get free money from the govt aka taxpayers to pay for their research and development? #carbontax
521 2018-12-19 23:09:29 i’d lick the motor oil off 2B’s asscrack
522 2018-12-19 23:09:27 Right, and you don't think Capitalism can be corrupted???

Crony Socialism is sharing the means of production within a group and not with the community as a whole. Oil is the perfect example, both in the US and Venezuela.

I would say "true socialism" would be equal ownership.
523 2018-12-19 23:09:23 Toppling Assad would place Syria under the control of Israel. IS have been agents in a proxy war on behalf of Israeli, Saudi, Fed Res and Genie Oil interests. Further, if Assad were toppled, not only would IS make a dramatic resurgence, they'd have no counter bar Iran in the ME.
524 2018-12-19 23:09:22 Thats how they get their oil, on line 9, the pipeline shipping Alberta oil via ontario
525 2018-12-19 23:09:08 We dont rely on Alberta my family moved out west to work in oil industry. But realized when Harper was in office it is a dying industry.  Know they are working in cape breton at the wind farms. And one brother works in tidal industry so we are becoming increasingly ahead of game
526 2018-12-19 23:09:03 But if we don’t depend on oil, do we really care whether China is off of it?  Hell, we can then sell our oil to them and transfer wealth from China into the United States.

537 2018-12-19 23:07:52 Selling out to oil, letting Nestle take our pure water for less than one resident pays a year, poisoning Flint, and the lame duck move. Now, be proud of that, you sell out.

539 2018-12-19 23:07:42 I hope you're not saying you agree with Trump pulling out of Syria when our allies have fought and secure the vast majority of Syrian oil fields that they will lose if we leave. Russia is taking 25% of what the Syrian govt has. We lose influence, Kurd's would be slaughtered, etc.
540 2018-12-19 23:07:38 what he’s selling that you consider snake oil?

542 2018-12-19 23:07:29 Need to some sails on that or buy an oil rig!!!!
543 2018-12-19 23:07:26 Почему?
544 2018-12-19 23:07:22 do you think that us "getting off oil" would suddenly make oil cease to be a resource? would china get off oil too? this is a half-measure
545 2018-12-19 23:07:21 At the risk of sounding Anti Albertan, how does making my commute home a total shitshow stick it to them liberal gov types in Ottawa? I also make my living in Oil but I guess I fail to see how this helps anything.

547 2018-12-19 23:07:20 Please Veto the budget, if no funds for wall! Also in my business a 5% cut in all departments was required when oil prices were down, that is how to avoid layoffs. Give each government department the same chosen as business!

I just don’t understand how people think they’re gonna wake up to a no oil world in our lifetime 

It will take decades to fully transition and until then... we still need .... oil 

Even green tech needs oil...
551 2018-12-19 23:07:13 Noodles with Palm oil sir
552 2018-12-19 23:06:58 I need Santa to come through with 4 new tires, an oil change, and a detailed wash
553 2018-12-19 23:06:49 We leave now, they get crushed by Turkey, Russia, etc as they land grab. That area is oil rich. It would have been mutually beneficial to have a pro US secular region in middle east.
554 2018-12-19 23:06:47 OIL PRICES ARE AT RECORD LOWS, YET WE'RE PAYING CLOSE TO $3.00/GAL, FOR FUEL OIL. THAT HAS GOT TO BE BECAUSE THE GREEDY OIL COMPANIES AREN'T MAKING ENOUGH MONEY. SAME WITH GASOLINE PRICES.

557 2018-12-19 23:06:34 @simple say I want to keep $500 in a car maintenance fund. Every mo a little $$ is taken from safe to spend until I get to $500. after that, it stops taking money every month. If I go get an oil change 460 bucks it would begin drafting again. Is this something you've considered?
558 2018-12-19 23:06:10 You can drink oil. ONCE. ;). LOL
559 2018-12-19 23:06:06 So, I don't actually get what point you think you're making.
Of course it's impossible to live without oil right now, that is entirely the issue.

Which is why we need to start the switch away from it, not prop it up. Forward, not static.
560 2018-12-19 23:06:03 I seriously dreaaaaaaadddddd when my car needs an oil change lbvs am I the only one or
561 2018-12-19 23:05:59 Our fleet manager was @chevrolet today to drop off a Bolt for recall service & they offered to change the OIL for free. Our guy said that vehicle doesn’t need it...but an employee kept insisting because the system was saying so. Finally someone in the garage yelled “IT'S AN EV!”
562 2018-12-19 23:05:52 Liars are the ones who write misleading articles. Liars are the ones who suggest that all or a majority are affected.

The ones getting money out of this:
Big oil
ICE car manufacturers
Short sellers

And they get A LOT more money out of this than Musk/Tesla.
563 2018-12-19 23:05:51 It’s also about not using the sheer amount of oil we are going through at the moment. If we moved off oil for vehicles using oil for some things wouldn’t be bad marginally. It’s such a dumb straw man. Then again Carney is dumb.
564 2018-12-19 23:05:51 Yes and it's open entry, a big policy shift. The supply of vehicles for hire is flooded. Government policy changes screwed cabbies.

Government policy changes screwed the oil patch.

The difference is he's ok with cabbies getting screwed, but not the oil patch workers.
565 2018-12-19 23:05:47 Yep, fracking is a terrible idea, folks. The way oil companies do it, the cheapest possible way, is even worse.
566 2018-12-19 23:05:41 changed the oil in my jeep and replaced a brake light bulb...
split some more wood and did some more clearing/landscaping over in the side yard....

another productive day adulting on my day off of work..
567 2018-12-19 23:05:41 As far as Putin is concerned, they've already secured the largest oil asset portfolio in Venezuela they could've possibly secured, but saving Maduro is going to be very costly. So as long as Russia can keep its share, don't mind getting rid of the liability (Maduro regime)
568 2018-12-19 23:05:39 Nice trading.
I read your thread on FIO
Did you not take the long trade because of the oil report?
569 2018-12-19 23:05:36 Agreed. We also need to tap more of our shale reserves as a bridge to getting off of oil and being dependent on foreign countries to supply our oil addiction.
570 2018-12-19 23:05:36 I am more concerned about wood for the car heater, and lamp oil for the headlights!
571 2018-12-19 23:05:29 How much oil does Canada (IrvingOil) import from Saudi Arabia? Very little?
572 2018-12-19 23:05:28 Thn 2014 saya ketua panja UU Perkebunan, dan membuat payung hukum lahirnya Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan Kelapa Sawit (BPDPKS) utk mengelola dana perkebunan sawit agar industri sawit nasional dikelola scr berkelanjutan melalui kebijakan Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO).
573 2018-12-19 23:05:28 No, just coconut oil for now
574 2018-12-19 23:05:24 Unemployment down less dependency on foreign oil
575 2018-12-19 23:05:12 Over 2000 out of work oil workers in trucks, protesting trudeau & notleys destruction of Canada's pipelines, in #nisku , Alberta now this is my canada ,not Toronto fairy docks.
576 2018-12-19 23:04:52 Any proof of that? I can provide proof of foreign election influence and anti-oil funding. Funds for aboriginal groups to oppose oil development and more. Plse show proof of your claim
577 2018-12-19 23:04:48 When you get under that Nigerian sun and it’s supposed to be boiling the water in you but instead it’s burning oil. You’ll know
578 2018-12-19 23:04:46 And just happens to work as a trucker in the oil patch.

I’ve been in 3 construction industries and ran a mobile catering truck. 

I’ll never forget the 3 guys in line going off about a girl driver, and I’ll never forget the look when I said, you mean my sister . #TruthHurts
579 2018-12-19 23:04:45 The actual argument I was making is that it's impossible to live without oil in today's society. 
If you think you can give it a try .
You wont be able even for a day.
580 2018-12-19 23:04:37 おはようございます～( ¨̮ )

584 2018-12-19 23:04:00 @BullsBearsFBN @zacharykarabell There is quite a bit we could do to push the way we currently do things (in reference to your @elonmusk comments).

For instance we can now break down non-recyclable materials back into oil material, produce plastics that aren't poly based...
585 2018-12-19 23:03:50 things that make you go mmm...
Alberta: 1) after repeated boom and bust oil cycles they still add no value to a commodity 2) they champion conservatism, capitalism and free markets 
YET they are looking for bailouts from the feds.
586 2018-12-19 23:03:47 Dear May. That’s because you haven’t got my supreme recipe, fathead. You only have to beg. It includes chopped hot chillies, port, chocolate,ginger wine, Cointreau, linseed oil, WD 40, Duckham’s 20-50, Swarfega, and two squirts of Redex. Your Rotary Wankel of a mind will explode
587 2018-12-19 23:03:41 jus rubbed olive oil on my body.. been trying this and i hope this glow up my skin so i can be walking around like hot tamale like selena is. shoo
588 2018-12-19 23:03:23 Oklahoma is like a lot of crappy places: pay for play. Oil companies literally have their names chiseled on the inside of our capital dome. Shameful.
589 2018-12-19 23:03:07 There's only so few nations left that aren't protected by Russia that also have oil. Both the democrats and republicans are warmongering shits, even Trump is too hawkish for my taste but fuck all, he's infinitely better than his predecessors
590 2018-12-19 23:03:03 My dog will tear down some aluminum foil and cuticle oil.

593 2018-12-19 23:02:47 Quebec does not block Alberta oil.
594 2018-12-19 23:02:42 Mmm i love the combo of wood and your oil painting 
595 2018-12-19 23:02:36 Good. Anyone listening to Al Gore deserves to lose everything. That's what you get when you purchase a bottle of magical elixir from the Snake Oil Salesman.
596 2018-12-19 23:02:33 So, David, explain exactly how much JT is doing FOR... AB’s/Canada’s oil industry...
597 2018-12-19 23:02:31 Either Palmer's coconut oil or manuka flower honey. Also Palmer's coconut oil co-wash.
598 2018-12-19 23:02:26 With the thinking, an albertan can also become an Uber driver also uh in 15 secs.  Point  is, if you are an oil worker or a taxi driver, government policy destroys It’s called race to the bottom. Again, why is not ok for Canada buying Saudi oil but ok for Saudi Uber investment
599 2018-12-19 23:02:21 Oil producers drill down on data with Google venture -  #cloud_computing #cloud
600 2018-12-19 23:02:16 In BC oil companies et all supported the carbon tax cuz BCLibCons gave them the money collected off the back of citizens. AG Doyle castigated them for giving millions to companies that didn't even meet their own criterions!

606 2018-12-19 23:01:56  RT @clarkconquers: How do CVS and Walgreens both don’t have body oil? All this damn lotion, and not one thing of baby oil smh
607 2018-12-19 23:01:55 Would you like to cite that? Also, keep in mind Canada supplies 40% of your oil plus many other things. Quid Pro Quo and all.
608 2018-12-19 23:01:50 Like how did I come get an oil change and so happen to run over a bolt at the shop..
609 2018-12-19 23:01:48 Talk about the 60% of Quebec that want a pipeline instead of Saudi oil
610 2018-12-19 23:01:41 America’s credibility takes another hit. Nations are noticing. America will not be able to count on their allies because their allies cannot count on them. Enjoy the oil and coal.
611 2018-12-19 23:01:36 I think California oil fills that bill.
612 2018-12-19 23:01:34 Fire: Where do you think we're going to get the energy to power our daily functions such as the most basic things like transportation? Every war over the last 30 years is about control over oil, I'm astonished they haven't planted the American flag in Venezuela yet tbh
613 2018-12-19 23:01:34 You are a goddam fool if you think hanging onto oil is the answer. 
It hasn't been the answer for decades, it certainly isn't now.
614 2018-12-19 23:01:25 Page two is right there! There's tanning oil and powder and thread but not the cooking fishy oil thing!

619 2018-12-19 23:00:37 #cdnpoli Alberta wake up. Oil & Gas is not your future. It is time to diversify. Building pipeline is like investing in typewriters in 90's.
620 2018-12-19 23:00:33 They already have pipelines to those supplying Oil & Gas.   So that’s ok, but no you can’t have pipelines to send excess to world markets!  Is that what you are saying?

625 2018-12-19 23:00:11 Only if the US builds a coalition with the Latin American countries, Brazil and Columbia are going to be on board, but Russia would need a guarantee to keep the oil assets they got in exchange for loans to Venezuela, it's now a lot larger than China's ownership of Venezuela oil

I mean I understood stuff up to like season 4
But then with the black oil and the vaccine
And the faceless bounty hunters I mean what was THAT shit
629 2018-12-19 22:59:54 Why didn't we get a pipeline when oil was $100 a barrel?
630 2018-12-19 22:59:49 If you were near .. i have TWO small oil fryers that i'd pass off to ya. They were replaced with Air Fryers. So now this house has 4 instant pots and 3 air fryers lol.
631 2018-12-19 22:59:41 The point is why bother bringing in Oil & Coal Co CEO’s to say there’s a 2 Sided argument when Trump’s own WH study showed Manmade Climate Change will bring the US into financial ruin and the Pentagon agreed it’s a Nat Security Threat. There is no need to debate at this point.

640 2018-12-19 22:59:04 The whole purpose of the creation of suburbs is to further a war economy via an economy for oil profits. Sprinkle in all the racist agendas behind this and wallah, welcome to America.
641 2018-12-19 22:59:00 Ruining an election over oil.  Sounds very American.
642 2018-12-19 22:58:50 Yeah but that works both ways. AB would lose western, northern, and eastern shipping routes for their oil, which would make the glut even worse. Plus you’d need your own currency, which wouldn’t be strong if you can’t get oil to tidewater
643 2018-12-19 22:58:49 Olive Oil Not a Lawyer
644 2018-12-19 22:58:46 Maybe, but only because there might not have been an oil and steel embargo imposed by the FDR administration on the Japanese, prompting the change in strategy towards attacking the United States for a free hand in the Indies (1/2)

664 2018-12-19 22:57:24 I'm not your guy o. You that cook noodles with palm oil tueh! Olohun maje
665 2018-12-19 22:57:23 A lot of grumbling on here but come on. Just braised turbot with cockles, clams and mussels, shallot puree, herb oil, summer vegetables, and a fish sauce, accompanied by sounds of the seaside? At this stage? Might as well have done beans on toast. #mastercheftheprofessionals
666 2018-12-19 22:57:22 Agree.  But oil stocks are cheap now. Check out $XOM and $DNR .  2 stocks I use as a bell weather to gauge oil.
667 2018-12-19 22:57:19 First dish, pineapple peels&spinach I think, green pepper, oil. 

2. Pineapple back, diced pineapples, tomatoes and green leaves. 

3. Looks like steak, beef, garlic, fruit sauce. 

4.fried coco yam, fish, leaf,milk

This no be meal.
668 2018-12-19 22:57:17 Create a fleet of tanker trucks that roll out of Ft Mac full of oil 24/7 to all corners of the country. Keep rolling them until people realize that pipelines are a better alternative.
669 2018-12-19 22:57:16 As a biker we love to mollycoddle our bikes but from experience on mainstream bikes valve checks are pointless. Oil and filters cost little and I’m happy to over service on that front.

671 2018-12-19 22:56:44 So hey, I just remembered I won some essential oil. Were you ever able to get those out?
672 2018-12-19 22:56:39 Is it insincerity on the part of APC? Or uninformed about the workings of the Oil sector? Or unpreparedness? Whatever it is, it showed in every sphere of governance under APC, we retrogressed for one/all of these reasons.

674 2018-12-19 22:56:26 Any chance you’ll ever be making CBD oil cartridges?
675 2018-12-19 22:56:23 You CANNOT reform a pediphile! I don’tcare if you throw holy oil, holy water, sling smoke, or say a blessing over the priest. The church in Rome should be paying the victims millions. Most face costly counseling. I know, I’ve live with it for 58 years.
676 2018-12-19 22:56:18 olive oil and salt???
677 2018-12-19 22:56:15 Haunted by the taste of truffle oil.

679 2018-12-19 22:55:58 If Sarah Sanders nose grew everytime she lied, i could walk to the moon on it. I still think her next career will be a snake oil salesperson. Any ideas what else she could do?
680 2018-12-19 22:55:47 Let me be really blunt when I say that the oil industry should get nothing beyond offering to re-train those who want it in renewable energy sectors. 

Nothing. At all. Ever again. 
The oil industry is a fucking blight.
681 2018-12-19 22:55:42 To displace Saudi oil in Eastern Canada, you’d not only need a pipeline, but you’d also need to retool the refineries (at billions more dollars) AND you’d need Alberta to accept a discount on their oil price. 
Cripes. #PnPCBC
682 2018-12-19 22:55:41 Side note: I'll be busy tomorrow - Need to get oil changed, send x-mas gifts out via the post office, and do some shopping. Unfortunately, there won't be a stream. I apologize in advance!
683 2018-12-19 22:55:23 Oil closed above 47, do u think we go higher from here or lower first possible? What's your take on SPX? Do u think we get a rally into year end?
684 2018-12-19 22:55:21 No one is suggesting to decommission all oil and coal power plants right at this moment, the transition will be gradual regardless. And for sure the continuing INCREASE in fossil fuel usage that's happening right now needs to stop.

690 2018-12-19 22:54:32 Can anyone recommend a trustworthy brand for Essential oils available in Australia?
Note: I do have a Doterra account but would like something not from an mlm company, organic and pure. 
Just because the bottle says so, it might mot be the case of being 100% pure oil.
Any tips?

693 2018-12-19 22:54:14 lol is there really an oil protest on both sides of the hendey..... jesus fuck y’all are too wild
694 2018-12-19 22:54:09 Hey even oil executives have to live where the jobs are.

698 2018-12-19 22:53:59 Well you need materials to build the oil pipeline through Syria to Europe don’t you?
699 2018-12-19 22:53:58 Even though I won’t be in school spring semester, I’m not gonna stop practicing my craft. Gonna practice figure drawing and more art techniques. May experiment with other mediums besides oil and charcoal
700 2018-12-19 22:53:50 Words of reason. Hurting Canadian business will be only achievement of this stupid move. Especially while promoting Saudi on account of our oil industry.
701 2018-12-19 22:53:50 Currently mad at:

The oil is locked in storage.

4. Russia could pressure the US to extradite Gulen in exchange for a big favor from Turkey

5. Loudly support Brexit/France protesters 

6. Look the other way on N Korean oil exports

7. Protest Magnitsky Acts

711 2018-12-19 22:53:00 Oil?
712 2018-12-19 22:52:52 Its not his plan, and its not the energy industry. Oil is getting phased out on its own, his tax will invest in alternative sources. Please stop  lying!!!
713 2018-12-19 22:52:51 We still subsidize the oil/gas industry with at least $10B annually. I’ll thank myself & the rest of the taxpayers.
714 2018-12-19 22:52:28 since when tf are oil changes $75?!
715 2018-12-19 22:52:27 Let's step back from the rhetoric and Hyperbole and focus on the facts people. This isn't about Trudeau or QC or even Oil. This is about a Court demanding industry do its due diligence to avoid future delays & cancellations. Self regulation wasn't good enuf re K.M or Energy East.

722 2018-12-19 22:51:35 You really out here wasting some good oil pastels for this
723 2018-12-19 22:51:24 A liquid. I've lost so much coconut oil debating the states of matter with TSA agents.
724 2018-12-19 22:51:18 D) Russia is broke. One of the reasons 4 going into Syria was their oil. The president made it unavailable to him. He's put the hardest sanctions on Russia ever, including individual oligarchs. He canceled a meeting at G20 w/Putin over Ukraine. Capitulation my eye.
725 2018-12-19 22:51:17 I support Brett regarding Albertan oil, but it seems when government policy changes screw industries (like taxis), Brett doesn't give a crap.

You may not want Saudi oil, but why are you ok with Saudi investments in Uber? Thousands of cabbies screwed cuz of govt & you dont care.
726 2018-12-19 22:51:11 What about all Saudi tankers bringing oil to the east coast? Who’s protesting that?
727 2018-12-19 22:51:10 @MBuhari #2019BudgetPresentation is a big joke like that of #JubrilFromSudan. His crude oil production, Oil Benchmark price and growth rate give impression of a country other than Nigeria. I'm not sure our President is well. He needs HELP
728 2018-12-19 22:51:09 It depends on what you are looking for and your concerns are. The face wash is good for getting rid of oil and even better if you use the face brush with it, but the moisturiser is meh tbh i just use a gel moisturiser now
729 2018-12-19 22:51:01 Maybe try clove oil, put a drop on cotton wool then put that on the ulcer, it will make your mouth go numb, but it will help with the pain 
730 2018-12-19 22:50:55 I just finished eating way more pizza than that.

Mmm tasty oil

737 2018-12-19 22:50:19 Because the oil and gas industry does not want to lose money! Not to mention all the people involved or who own stocks in it! They pay big money and kill people who are a threat to there way of life! That simple! Thats why technology is suppressed in this country!
738 2018-12-19 22:50:06 #GreenNewDeal because we can’t afford to spend billions to reduce emissions that are already low compared to the rest of the world. Oh wait.... Also, we don’t drink oil and we all don’t breathe smog... do you live in China? @StevenLaba48 @mshutupbitch
739 2018-12-19 22:50:03 Exactly! China & USA want to keep those well paid refinery jobs in their country, the value added product is much more profitable & the US & China oil industry doesn’t want any competition for the refined product. We have a large refinery on the East Coast that is very profitable
740 2018-12-19 22:50:01 Only like 8% of their income is from oil
741 2018-12-19 22:49:48 until now i wasn't aware that snake oil health claims were made about those lamps

there's nothing wrong with just saying "hey, i like that lamp" but I'd hope people would be a bit more skeptical & use some common sense before believing fantastical claims like those
742 2018-12-19 22:49:43 I hear ya, girl. L’occitane youth oil has taken 3 years off my winter skin, over the last few years.
743 2018-12-19 22:49:39 How about the billions spent every year propping up the oil industry! Without subsidies they’d be done! 
744 2018-12-19 22:49:38 That’s ok @michellobama43 I believe the House was blessed with Holy oil before our beautiful FLOTUS could move into the residence.
745 2018-12-19 22:49:32 This morning, I told my dad that I used up the last of the engine oil to top off my car. He told me to buy more from Walmart after work; and then just now, he texted me a “pick up order” receipt and said that I just have to stop by on the way home to get it 
746 2018-12-19 22:49:31 I’m not sure Brandon. We will get a hint of what this is about from the mainstream media reaction to it. If they don’t criticize much, it’s bad news at it likely signify a dangerous agreement w/Turkey to allow them to take over the oil/gas rich areas, in return of dumping Russia.
747 2018-12-19 22:49:03 No OIL, No LIFE!!!

756 2018-12-19 22:48:31 Lol yep. They said approached by individuals and businesses. They want moolah...but I also have been waiting for us to find a new sounce of income besides oil. The market is wide rn with the legalization in the US. And the organic craze. I think economically it may be great. 
757 2018-12-19 22:48:25 Ummmm....well....  let’s just say no one burned the midnight oil coming up with this one. #simple #sortadumb
758 2018-12-19 22:48:23 I have the worst cold, I’ve had an allergic reaction to this oil I’m using to help my cold so my face is covered in rashes AND I am bloated to absolute fuck. Merry Christmas :-)))))))
759 2018-12-19 22:48:15 It also points out snake oil salesman like him.
760 2018-12-19 22:48:09 It was just weed oil in a thing that looked like a crack pipe
761 2018-12-19 22:48:07 Don’t they understand that pulling US troops out will essentially create a vacuum that will likely be filled by Russia who will then in turn work to further destabilize the region while simultaneously pursuing the oil and distribution by virtue of the deep water port in Tartus
762 2018-12-19 22:47:58 seeing some aarif rahman lust on the twitters
my aunt once painted an oil painting of him and gave it to him at a fan-meeting lol
763 2018-12-19 22:47:45 Brett, now you realize how governments should he held accountable for screwing industries.

It seems you only get mad when it affects you, but when you make coin off of screwing then it's ok.

I support the oil patch workers and Alberta, but stop playing both ways.
764 2018-12-19 22:47:42 Now I’m taking apps for an assistant to help w/full body oil rubs

765 2018-12-19 22:47:41 You certainly can't "drink oil" but you also cannot run modernity without it. Replacing oil and many of its derivatives is a monumental challenge that's not aided by an exclusive focus on wind and solar & other low energy density sources.

We simply MUST also have nuclear power.
766 2018-12-19 22:47:39 Too bad!! Us veterans are tired of dying and getting maimed for American Imperialism and oil. Let it be someone else's problem
767 2018-12-19 22:47:35 As long as they can rig bonds, gold, oil & stocks why worry. Just make it up as you HFT down the trail to Hell.
768 2018-12-19 22:47:30 Coherent policy? Surely you jest. The US is in Syria illegally for OIL. We should have never been there but for Israel wanting a pipeline in dispute with Iran. This is why the war mongers are against Iran. OIL and $$$$$$$$$$$$$
769 2018-12-19 22:47:25 The plan is to get off oil not imbed it in our culture?
770 2018-12-19 22:47:06 Lol

BP: is that an oil spill there? I thought you were just happy to see me 
771 2018-12-19 22:46:59 Exactly!  Clear where Trump’s orders have originated.  No US in Syria means Russia and Assad carve up the territory themselves, means Putin gets access to the Med for his oil pipeline and an excuse to park ships off the coast of Syria.
772 2018-12-19 22:46:48 You may recall that by 2008 oil and gold prices were skyrocketing. The Fed saw the inflation starting in 2005 or 2006, and they began to raise rates. Eventually after a number of rate hikes they popped the bubbles in housing and commodities, but things popped hard.
773 2018-12-19 22:46:39 Build a refinery in Alberta (and one in the atlantic provinces ) then build your pipeline to them. Canadian oil; Canadian gas.
   Or, this is crazy I know, make Canada a leader in climate change and spend our taxes on clean energy industry (in the same areas)
774 2018-12-19 22:46:34 Belly laughing in the waiting area getting my oil changed. Not a euphemism.
775 2018-12-19 22:46:30 Maggie asked me to cook dinner because she’s not home and her exact words “if you can read you can cook” well aparrebtly I can’t read because I JUST PUT 1 TBSP OF VINEGAR IN MY INGREDIENTS INSTEAD OF OLIVE OIL WAHHHHHHHH YEEEEEEEEE FUUUU
776 2018-12-19 22:46:21 So you protest low oil prices by making life difficult for everyone else. Tell me again why we should feel sorry for you.
777 2018-12-19 22:46:15 I never put cheap oil in my car
778 2018-12-19 22:46:14 There are places in the world where green energy does indeed power the local civilization. Also it isn't like oil has never had catastrophic ecological damage in the past. Exxon Valdeez and Deep Water Horizon spring to mind. Bird deaths due to wind power are always overstated.
779 2018-12-19 22:46:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
780 2018-12-19 22:46:06 Why is Olive Oil so effin' expensive?
781 2018-12-19 22:45:54 Look at me counting somebody's awards..Masha Allah tho
782 2018-12-19 22:45:44 i already asked if you wanted me to change your oil and you said no 
783 2018-12-19 22:45:40 Have you tried Castor oil and Vaseline?
784 2018-12-19 22:45:32 “Brown field” refers to refining on site where the oil sand product is being extracted. Since it’s  already being impacted by the extraction process, the EIA process should be much easier.
785 2018-12-19 22:45:29 #GreenNewDeal because of FEAR of apocalyptic catastrophe (or else we'll drink oil & die)

788 2018-12-19 22:45:15 True, but for people to claim that we need to reduce our dependence on oil, but make no considerable effort to do so in their own life (like celebrities), & are unaware of how many products are made with petroleum, are hypocritical and naive.  World demand is increasing.
789 2018-12-19 22:45:14 Cool!  Very limited experience with oil based but I can see how its poppin' for you
790 2018-12-19 22:45:05 @CFR_org be given to Shia, and the remaining oil will be divided between Russia, Iran, perhaps China as well. The House of Saud will be eradicated, brutally. Russia will have access to the gulf and will be worlds energy superpower. Controlling oil production, one of 5 pillars.

793 2018-12-19 22:44:32 I include: Education, Health, Social Care, Railways, Bus Services, Water & the provision of social housing (but not the entirety of the housing market!). Energy supply markets (oil, gas, coal, nuclear, wind etc) are competitive markets that require regulation not public ownership
794 2018-12-19 22:44:28 Straight up Humans lucked out soo hard with the trillions of gallons of oil that on this planet.
795 2018-12-19 22:44:20 Remember when we weren't addicted to oil and didn't prop up oil rich autocrats who suppress their people and sow violence to advance their own interests?
796 2018-12-19 22:44:20 Let's be honest, Brett is concerned that government policy changes is screwing Alberta and it's unfair and unjust, especially since Canada is accepting Saudi oil.

Yet when government policy screws the taxi industry he doesn't give a crap because he AND Saudi $ are Uber investors
797 2018-12-19 22:44:09 Seraj’s visit to Fezzan would have been seen as gesture of good Will and responsible governance if it was made before the seizure of oil fields by the AFM . He is forced to make this trip for political motives his capacity to bargain with the people of Fezzan has been weakened .

799 2018-12-19 22:44:09 I started taking half a dropper of 1000mg strength CBD oil for about a week. and I have already noticed a difference. I haven’t had any significant instances of depression or anxiety in a week and I’m honestly amazed. I feel like I can think more clearly, focus, and I tend not to
800 2018-12-19 22:43:58 I need a Arab please man I need that oil money
801 2018-12-19 22:43:49 Please fight against oil prizes seriously

803 2018-12-19 22:43:25 As long as they aren't snake oil saleswomen like you
804 2018-12-19 22:43:21 I would kill for an oil spill daq right now
805 2018-12-19 22:43:14 I will never vote for you because you are so deceptive. You take the phase out quote completely out of context. It was in defense of Alberta oil, making it clear that we're not shutting it down:
"We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels"
806 2018-12-19 22:43:00 Well this was a pretty arrogant tweet, nice to know you have sincerity for others going through hard times... In saying that I didn’t see the GM in Ontario closure affect the Canadian economy as much as the western oil issues!... just in case we’re measuring Dicks here.
807 2018-12-19 22:42:53 As annoying as it was, it did give me some insight into just how deeply intertwined with movement conservative politics more or less apolitical generic con artists actually are. So much fish oil, stock tips, magical cancer cures, etc.
808 2018-12-19 22:42:53 さ、左馬刻、、、、
809 2018-12-19 22:42:37 Apparently my oil filter is a specialized type and they have to order it..... yay 
810 2018-12-19 22:42:37 Doesn’t really matter, not like we can just stop oil. And geo is far too expensive, and no one wants to invest do to the costs. Our costs would soar
811 2018-12-19 22:42:31 Could the plastic breakdown into hydrocarbons again, perhaps becoming crude oil again under temperature and pressure?
812 2018-12-19 22:42:24 Snake oil salesman.
813 2018-12-19 22:42:22 All for oil and pipelines. Buzz off, conservabros.
814 2018-12-19 22:42:12 Oil at $46.
10 year Treasury notes plunging to 2.82% yields.

Where is the inflation case that necessitates 3 rate hikes to "cool" the economy, especially with the global economic growth outlook plunging?
815 2018-12-19 22:42:12 Oh, for fucks sake Alberta. He's giving you 1.6 Billion dollars more than you should get. 

Shut the fuck up for a few days with you "Won't somebody think of the oil workers" bull shit.
816 2018-12-19 22:42:09 Some of y’all beard oil scents >>>>

818 2018-12-19 22:42:08 17. Hence depending on who and when you’re shipping- and the current price of crude oil, under the new under recovery regime - Nigeria can either be making a killing on its consumers and losing forex from exporting crude or making money on crude & bleeding vis under recovery
819 2018-12-19 22:42:08 Man would you guys be fucked when the worlds oil demand drops over the next 20 years.  You’ll want the backbone of confederation to help transition your economy off oil reliance.
820 2018-12-19 22:42:05 Crude Weekly Price Outlook: Oil Price Crushed into Support
821 2018-12-19 22:41:50 The regs drawn up by draughtsmen and architects were removed by big property owners who have high office in politics etc... Just like the oil company that saved something like US$20 and caused the world's biggest oil spill. Go figure.
822 2018-12-19 22:41:47 My lady does hot oil treatment and can straighten it . She’s done my hair since I went natural in high school
823 2018-12-19 22:41:41 Laws are apparently for everyone except your big oil donors.
824 2018-12-19 22:41:40 Generalizing but in good times oil industry cashes in & absconds in tough times.
'AB accumulated > 100,000 wellsites that have received reclamation certificates — or are exempt from reclamation based on age — during past 50 yrs. Liability... eventually reverts back to taxpayer.'
825 2018-12-19 22:41:36 Imma try out this Shea moisture black castor oil shampoo & see if it does my hair justice.
826 2018-12-19 22:41:29 That’s exactly what will happen. Oil sales will decline in the next 20 years. EV will pay a charge tax.
827 2018-12-19 22:41:22 Normal kok, temenku yg kurus dari lahir aja ada stretch marks yg lebih kentara dari ini. Coba pake shea butter, rosehip oil atau bio oil
828 2018-12-19 22:41:21 With or without oil exploration tax subsidies & remediation of abandoned assets?
829 2018-12-19 22:41:19 45% of Quebecers believe  that pipelines are the safest way to ship oil. I am not sure how the other 55% could think otherwise.
830 2018-12-19 22:41:04 I make it rain extra virgin olive oil in the club
831 2018-12-19 22:41:00 Your option is get rid of arms deal and but still buy Saudi oil vs keeping the arms deal and not buying their oil.

Which option results in more jobs for Canadians?
832 2018-12-19 22:41:00 The plans to build one and rout it though Syria happened before the war, it has sence been put on hold for self evident reasons. So you're right, it's not oil, it's the hypothetical possibility of oil
833 2018-12-19 22:40:58 Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back
834 2018-12-19 22:40:58 In the baby oil aisle
835 2018-12-19 22:40:53 IM GETTING AN OIL CHANGE TOMORROW AT 7 AM
836 2018-12-19 22:40:53 Look down the line to 2025. When the bell curve starts going down is when the side effects of fracking will start to go up. They’re producing oil by fracking which has never run a profit but is causing serious environmental damage…
837 2018-12-19 22:40:33 Ofcourse I always use some Shine for my latex .  But I don’t want my Silky bed sheets to get shiny oil  too ! 
Next time you can come shine my outfit 
838 2018-12-19 22:40:31 Trusting in a snake oil salesmen has never worked. Have a good day.
839 2018-12-19 22:40:24 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
840 2018-12-19 22:40:15 The reason I’m late for work today is I forgot that wood stain is oil based and I took me 45 to make my hands not look poop covered. 

-obviously the wood stain was brown colored I promise my hands were not covered in poop
841 2018-12-19 22:40:13 double cleansing hukumnya ka wajib kalo gk pake balm atau yg oil kalo micellar water kurang nendang heheh Terus rajin2 eksfoliasi aja tiap minggu ka.  Kalo produknya unk eksfoliasi bisa yg neogen bio pell,  di sesuain aja sama kondisi kulit ka nim. Sama jan lupa pake moisturizer

845 2018-12-19 22:39:30 I wanna do an oil painting, WHAT SHOULD I PAINT?
846 2018-12-19 22:39:27 you arent paying for anything in England, England is subsidising you to the tune of 18 billion a year, the oil price collapsed remember?
847 2018-12-19 22:39:25 George is an 03. Mechanically he’s relatively sound, minor oil leak & recent muffler roar. Physically he’s seen better days. I’m not sure what did more damage the deer, or my husband w/ the mallet “fixing” him post deer crunch. Love this car tho. Hoping for another 100k miles!
848 2018-12-19 22:39:22 Kenney and Barnes are small minded red neck jerks who think Albertans are dumb enough to buy into their anti Ottawa crap when it comes to fixing the oil issue facing Alberta!
849 2018-12-19 22:39:13 ..but you need oil in order to rebuild the roads 
850 2018-12-19 22:39:06 Steroids? Cookies and milk. You need demoral or something that knocks you the F out. I'll admit, I'm a wimp if I'm in pain. Better living through chemical dependency.  Try CBD oil. Might help if you get strong... I use it. I can handle a lot just not pain.
851 2018-12-19 22:39:05 Let it die. Should have started moving away from oil 20 years ago, no need to prop it up anymore at all.
852 2018-12-19 22:38:52 Kinda like having to ship oil via rail eh?

854 2018-12-19 22:38:48 Question: Ano ang hindi mo malilimutan sa 2018?

Answer: Nag change oil ako ng motor na hindi ko naisara ang drain plug. 
855 2018-12-19 22:38:34 The price of oil continues to slide yet heating oil is holding high and strong.
856 2018-12-19 22:38:32 I do oil pulling.
857 2018-12-19 22:38:27 Okay, I found it. 53% of Quebecers would rather their province develop it's own oil resources rather than bringing 100% of it from outside sources, this includes Alberta oil.
858 2018-12-19 22:38:22 Isn't the decision to do business with the Saudis a corporate one - General Dynamics and Irving Oil? And no one has mentioned the Canadian Wheat Board.
859 2018-12-19 22:38:19 my car is like two miles away from breaking down cuz my dumbass too lazy to get an oil change LMAOOO
860 2018-12-19 22:38:17 Nah. There has not been meaningful oil transit flows through Syria since before World War II. For serious domestic production, I don't think exports never reached 0.5 million barrels per day.
861 2018-12-19 22:38:11 Dawg y’all must just get oil money so y’all can start winning something at least
862 2018-12-19 22:38:10 The PC Government destroyed the Altantic Provinces, took the Royalty money from the Oil. Steel Plant closed, fisheries depleted from miss management. Coal mines shut down. Need I say more.
863 2018-12-19 22:38:09 do everything in simple shapes and dont use acrylic or oil
864 2018-12-19 22:38:01 Gold and silver prices are in a uptrend. Oil has bottomed hard. Time to invest in a good natural resource stock fund. People are gonna put their money somewhere.
865 2018-12-19 22:37:59 You want us off foreign oil? Make commuting more than 30 minutes illegal. That'll lower our dependence.
866 2018-12-19 22:37:56 I know..

People are driving to work only to find gates locked and that’s how they’re finding out they’re out of a job

Trudeau is delusional and it’s him killing the country not Alberta or our oil sands
867 2018-12-19 22:37:44 Stop your reliance on Oil, stop forcing your pipeline, start diversifying
868 2018-12-19 22:37:43 Your exhaustion worries me. I just spent 2 months feeling like you described. Then diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Pure, natural, organic, water-based CBD oil helped immensely. My appetite returned, helping the exhaustion. If you can find quality oil, I definitely recommend.
869 2018-12-19 22:37:39 love it! oil patch was heard today
870 2018-12-19 22:37:38 Hahahaha hey, haven’t you heard, we’re not oil cunts anymore - Der Spiegle made it all up 
871 2018-12-19 22:37:26 I have a few friends that use CBD oil & it totally helps 
872 2018-12-19 22:37:23 Lol you may very well be right, I force her to take vitamin d tablets. Also will be telling her to take black seed oil. I.A it should solve the problem.
873 2018-12-19 22:37:13 But Trump just ended the Syrian war and pulled our military the hell out of the hole!!  Guess you can’t admit lowest unemployment, oil independence, great job market.  I can go in and on, but of course you will say Trump did none of this!  I know the liberal mantra!   MAGA!
874 2018-12-19 22:37:13 There are a lot of Texans in Alberta, especially Calgary. The oil/gas industry means they move back and forth. No mystery that the politics are similar. Been true for 60 years.
875 2018-12-19 22:37:10 Water isn’t a lubricant but motor oil is!
876 2018-12-19 22:37:02 Oil -& money - that was the plan.
877 2018-12-19 22:37:00 had a scare this morning when all the lights on the dash were going crazy. so far just an oil change and one new tire needed. uugghh  #carissues when do they ever end?

880 2018-12-19 22:36:34 Watch it! He and his whole administration is going down. As Mueller tightens the noose and uncovers more evidence. The tRumps will be forced to slither out of town like the snakes that they are. Go ahead & Keep the snake oil that you bought as a souvenir.
881 2018-12-19 22:36:15 Russia slowly takes control of and owns all the allies in the Middle East - and the oil. That high giving with MBS was a picture of things to come. And Trump and the GOP helped it along.
882 2018-12-19 22:36:14 @TermineRadio oil and water
883 2018-12-19 22:36:01 Sorry. You caught me after I smoked a lot of weed. I had a blunt rolled in oil and dipped in Kief to the dome
884 2018-12-19 22:36:00 Oil and natural gas help keep you warm in the winter! #WednesdayWisdom
885 2018-12-19 22:35:57 It's developed enough to start and to encourage further development instead of throwing money at oil companies that don't need it
886 2018-12-19 22:35:55 What seems under-discussed is the charity as potential laundering exercise - who is to say the “donors” didn’t know they were buying influence the whole time? Trumps are beyond shady, of course, but I presume the oil slick is wider than the family.
887 2018-12-19 22:35:45 Show me where they were funded to “prove warming”.

The oil companies don’t have a clear financial motive in attacking anthropogenic climate change?
888 2018-12-19 22:35:42 I'm flexible... We can give less money to NATA and the UN while keeping tariff money rolling in. The farmers will want to grow hemp. It may be better for use than oil to make some plastics. Lose the cabal, close K St
889 2018-12-19 22:35:38 Castor oil is my last resort I even tried eggplant Parmesan
890 2018-12-19 22:35:24 ....but clearly you like other execs, like the oil executives whose lobbyists oppose H.R. 2242 / S. 750 ?
891 2018-12-19 22:35:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this December? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
892 2018-12-19 22:34:50 Yes, shorts could make as much as $24 billion if Tesla went bankrupt, and the oil and automotive companies would let out a sigh of relief, knowing that Tesla is no longer breathing down their neck with their constant innovation and no longer leading the charge on EV adoption.
893 2018-12-19 22:34:48 Not to be a pain but the vast majority of roads across the world are made with asphalt, which is petroleum... Totally agree with where you’re going but we can’t easily escape oil. It’s in so many everyday objects.
894 2018-12-19 22:34:47 Shouldn't be going up 1 cent as usa refined gasoline is at lowest in 5 years! Any increase is foreign oil refineries ripping us off just before christmas! Another reason we were sold out by previous tory governments and not building our own refineries!
895 2018-12-19 22:34:41 (The spray bottle is full of Ghost Pepper oil)
896 2018-12-19 22:34:35 That's a fallacy though, the experts are just a bunch of neocons drunk on oil baron daddy's dick. The only strategic goal we could have gotten was control of a pipeline, Syria was already a Russian puppet in the region and the only way that's changing is war with them.
897 2018-12-19 22:34:29 Now we shifting to oil money  dawg you sound pathetic
898 2018-12-19 22:34:27 Exactly.  Then get Canadians working.  Oil isn’t going anywhere for a few generations.  A large part of the planet is still developing & buying vehicles.  This isn’t changing for a good long while.
899 2018-12-19 22:34:27 Oil tends to move with transports. lotta us oil gets transported via rail.
900 2018-12-19 22:34:22 Sell them arms ,cancel oil to Quebec
901 2018-12-19 22:34:19 Somebody come teach me how to change my own damn oil 
902 2018-12-19 22:34:11 As you also know, there are now pipelines going to Montreal and to Burrard Inlet. There isn’t protests about them. Why? It is obvious: they don’t carry dilbit. It is not terribly difficult to grasp, but apparently too much for an oil industry and its claque of braying supporters.
903 2018-12-19 22:34:11 so please wholeheartedly oppose all new oil and gas exploration
904 2018-12-19 22:33:53 And y’all needed billions to win these trophies. Y’all ain’t shit without oil money.
905 2018-12-19 22:33:49 Of course City get the easiest path to success in every competition. Oil money still has influence.
906 2018-12-19 22:33:46 Translation:  GOP Oil projects will have to be defended privately instead of by American Men and Women!!! #MAGA #KAG #MAGA #USA #Syria
907 2018-12-19 22:33:43 Black Jamaican Castor oil. Use q-tips to put it on. Good for eyebrows too.
908 2018-12-19 22:33:41 I have a question: does coconut oil count as a solid or liquid when traveling? Or does it legit depend on the seasons (because we know what happens in spring/summer vs fall/winter)?
909 2018-12-19 22:33:27 In 2019 I'm looking for that special someone who will pay half my council tax and yet work on an offshore oil rig with precious little phone reception.
910 2018-12-19 22:33:25 CBD oil eases my anxiety.
911 2018-12-19 22:33:21 Very nice, but they lack the snake oil lubrication system that seems ever so popular with journalists!
912 2018-12-19 22:33:21 People complain about us going to #war over crude #oil. Think about the wars our children will fight over clean #water.
913 2018-12-19 22:33:21 yes you are right. USA is not much better than Russia. I pray for the time that oil and gas are replaces by sustainables and are no reasons for wars and greed anymore
914 2018-12-19 22:33:13 Well there must be money to be made in refining oil or China & the USA wouldn’t be in the business of doing it. These countries are not exactly charitable organizations. That’s why they’re considered global super powers.
915 2018-12-19 22:33:07 Obama pulled out of Iraq too early which played a part in the rise of ISIS who captured ground/revenue from oil. Obama ignored generals' advise. T listened to generals, gave them more authority/funding which has helped defeat much of ISIS who were strong under Obama,
916 2018-12-19 22:32:59 I've lived in Texas all of my life. I'm painfully aware of the oil and gas industry's influence in politics.
917 2018-12-19 22:32:59 You'd never know oil was crashing
918 2018-12-19 22:32:57 Just #StopAdani we know they will cause damage, water more than oil or coal is the new gold. Protect our water, all the world is after it.
919 2018-12-19 22:32:56 I find your wording odd, when referring to the Syrian government, you write “... they bid to get their hands on lucrative gas and oil fields.” Less biased version: “...they attempt to reinstate government sovereign control over lucrative gas and oil fields.” #fixedit
920 2018-12-19 22:32:55 Rub the oil in bro 
If you dont have it by 20, you’ll never get it
921 2018-12-19 22:32:45 You can’t get hit enough to sear properly. Oil needs to be smoking hot and no way I’m gonna let a whole pot of oil smoke.
922 2018-12-19 22:32:28 Lets support Canadians by making these foreign oil corporations pay higher royalties and taxes, like Scandinavian countries do.

Oil corps don’t care about you or the environment. It makes economic sense to put resources in renewable energy- that’s new jobs and money!
923 2018-12-19 22:32:26 Well, twitter only allows so many words in a tweet... Basically to harvest palm oil causes massive destruction to forests and we'll basically the world we live in... If you ask google or YouTube, the negatives of palm oil, girl you will see what is happening out there 
924 2018-12-19 22:32:23 Think of it this way, capitalism is a fine tuned tuned machine. If you don't oil the wheels, they grind to a halt. It requires well paid healthy workers who can afford to buy products from companies at scale. Hence why Henry Ford paid his workers well by the standards of the time
925 2018-12-19 22:32:17 I got an oil change today, I know it ain’t a big deal but I was supposed to get one in July....it’s December ...lol
926 2018-12-19 22:32:13 i keep mine simple so it’s just sugar, organic honey, & extra virgin olive oil!
927 2018-12-19 22:32:12 There is no market for #tarsands #oil.  Even if the #pipeline was built, we would be selling it for less than it costs to get it out of the ground.  #Corporatewelfare has to stop.  #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
928 2018-12-19 22:32:09 だいすきです(大声)
929 2018-12-19 22:32:08 Henry needs YouMove! Get online, superb for oldies with a good fish oil.
930 2018-12-19 22:32:04 I want some oil money man. Schalke in the UCL and Burton in the Carabao cup.
931 2018-12-19 22:32:00 Oil industries have benefited from years of high prices and low royalties fees. Suncor,  imperial oil, husky, cnrl are just some that have made billions in profit. So when do we start asking these companies to put some of their dollars for the benefit of the industry.
932 2018-12-19 22:31:59 If you want to know how this week is going, yesterday I got an oil change that cost $79 because my tires were misaligned. While waiting in the service center, I started a new story for work that Microsoft deleted today.
933 2018-12-19 22:31:43 @dpradhanbjp ji Should not we buy some quantities of WTI crude which is prevaling at ~  @$48/bbl for some of our refineries that can handle it ? I know that we have existing long term contract with oil producers in OPEC and Russia. @PMOIndia
934 2018-12-19 22:31:33 Bingo. Oil analogy may be meaningless but it's beside the real point.
935 2018-12-19 22:31:25 Shit. Well, my mom isn’t quite that bonkers. She basically just believes coconut oil is the god of the earth and will heal all things 
936 2018-12-19 22:31:21 The smell of my body oil will make you take your clothes off and sit next to me lol. S/O to @dgains1 for keeping it OG. I shall keep it near and never run out.
937 2018-12-19 22:31:14 Riiiiight, over here wondering how sales of oil pads doin
938 2018-12-19 22:31:14 You get Oil Money ?
939 2018-12-19 22:31:04 No, no, no. If not Edmonton, the geographic centre of Alberta which is close to Swan Hills. Otherwise North of Red Deer will separate from South Alberta. The part where all the oil and water is. ;) #ableg
940 2018-12-19 22:30:55 We’re all making plans for Nigel...to knock you oil cunts out 
941 2018-12-19 22:30:50 Unfortunately this situation would have happened to any party in government. Why did it come to this?Why only now do we need pipelines? Why not years ago? The oil business will never be what it once was.
942 2018-12-19 22:30:46 also, no idea how effective it actually is but when I was fighting a mouse I also stuck cotton balls I put peppermint oil on around my apartment b/c apparently they don’t like the smell
943 2018-12-19 22:30:36 Because you know me. 
I got back on Twitter because I read all the stuff about Tesla and Musk, and guess what. I did research. Not just one-sided. There's always more side than one.
Help them destroy Tesla. Big oil & shorts will make money off this and ppl lose their jobs. 
944 2018-12-19 22:30:36 that’s straight up oil my dood

947 2018-12-19 22:30:21 lol you defeated them
your useless allies only captured oil fields and that one city, raqqa, in which they had air support and outnumbered isis 10:1 but lost twice the men and it took them almost a year to take the city
you didn't do shit, remember who controlls the most of syria
948 2018-12-19 22:30:20 What is CBD oil?
949 2018-12-19 22:30:13 I'm seeing people say that Green New Deal is dressed up neoliberalism but, really folks, how is a huge zero carbon build out that will thoroughly up-end oil interests NOT A GOOD THING! Even if it doesn't utterly demolish capitalism in the process?
950 2018-12-19 22:30:13 Big tech, big finance, big telecomm, big media, big defense, big oil.

Break

951 2018-12-19 22:30:12 Ohhh thank you! I'm going to look into it! I've been trying all sort of natural products and so far the only thing that calms down breakouts is tea tree oil and like. 1 lush facemask. Shhsjsjdskkd
952 2018-12-19 22:30:06 Yes. What a nice Idea to give Iran all the oil supplies in syria so that they can sell it to china. The Result? China dethrowning the US. Very patriotic. Applause for idiots please.
953 2018-12-19 22:30:04 Im sorry to hear that. Get naked, take that hot shower, oil up & walk ‘round nekkid so as you get the op
954 2018-12-19 22:29:54 Hard to throw a Taco in Texas without hitting an oil/gas person.  Seriously.
955 2018-12-19 22:29:41 Why is this lavendar oil making me hyper
956 2018-12-19 22:29:35 Fun fact: each time I type Iranian Google suggests me nuclear , oil and weapons as autofill
957 2018-12-19 22:29:26 If u think a country which is in the EU, but separating from a union which is the EU country, like UK, then would not get accepted even though it already meets the needs. Plus the biggest oil producing country in the EU is Scotland, so why would they not want us in the EU.
958 2018-12-19 22:29:20 You just get yourself a rifle and head your fake stuffed-suit robo-talking a$$ over there then Sen. Rubio.  The American People (not Wall St and Big Oil) have no interest in staying in Syria.  Bring the troops home, send Marco!
959 2018-12-19 22:29:16 If we were going to do the right thing we'd take out Assad for crimes against humanity. We are nothing more than a security force protecting Corporate Interests. Banking, oil, and the Military Industrial Complex.
960 2018-12-19 22:29:11 2010: whoa, I can buy weed if I tell a “doctor” I have “anxiety”

2018: whoa, I can buy weed through an app and it shows up as a USB drive that burns oil
961 2018-12-19 22:29:02 Is it possible that Trudeau wants several foreign suppliers of oil and not all Canadian oil for reasons other than green ones? If Alberta and Sask supplied 90 percent or more , it would greatly strengthen the West politically and economically , strategically. Ottawa and the East
962 2018-12-19 22:28:59 The thick one is to draw the progesterone in oil into the syringe. The thin one is for the administration. All the way into the muscle, like a tetanus shot. Fun, right?

965 2018-12-19 22:28:48 Don’t put water on an oil fire
966 2018-12-19 22:28:40 Alberta and Saskatchewan, should Build a OIL Pipeline to Churchill, for We Have Ice--Breakers to Get SHIPS in and out with OIl that can be Delieved to European Countries, Thus Less Dependance on Russion Oil and Gas!!! Every One Happy!!!
967 2018-12-19 22:28:27 Smuggling of liquefied gas (#Belarusian oil company)  from Belarus to a number of EU countries is increasing .
WHO WILL STOP -Poland
968 2018-12-19 22:28:15 iF THE NEWS HOUNDS WOULD TELL THE TRUTH THEY WOULD FIND OUT THERE IS NO OIL JOBS IN aLBERTA BECAUSE YOU CANT HAVE FREEZEUP WHEN ITS  MELTING OUTSIDE IN dECEMBER
969 2018-12-19 22:28:00 Go catch some crappie of the lake, use some peko, flour, eggs, and pepper put some oranut oil in a pot turn heat up half way wait 10 minutes drop your fish in there and let it fry till it floats take it off and enjoy my man
970 2018-12-19 22:27:58 Consider the fact that will have a now growing non oil earnings to possibly make up for the shortfall
971 2018-12-19 22:27:49 no real take, final demand is in good shape and manufacturing is doing pretty good. it'll slow a bit as the decline in oil prices and global slowing feeds through but autos are way sub-sustainable at this point and inventories remain low. *shrug*
972 2018-12-19 22:27:48 Lake Erie - then get a jug of cooking oil?
973 2018-12-19 22:27:29 Million dollar idea: vape shops selling Dick-flavored vape oil.
974 2018-12-19 22:27:28 Anyone need an oil change?
975 2018-12-19 22:27:26 I’m more worried about the billions were already paying to buy a bankrupt pipeline and give corporate welfare payments for failed oil businesses
976 2018-12-19 22:27:25  Iraq like Iran Libya used to sell their oil to USA and indeed were the allies of USA against the Soviet Union. They were used, discarded then for 2/3 destroyed.
977 2018-12-19 22:27:15 It’s insane that Americans want some barbaric wall from the Middle Ages. If we go that route, maybe we should also add a giant moat. Oh & if the immigrants get past that, we can dump pots of scolding oil on their heads. It’ll be just like the good ole days.
978 2018-12-19 22:27:14 You need to get a vape pen with thc oil problem solved
979 2018-12-19 22:27:11 ...in this admin, has no affect on the fact that all the coal, oil, and manufacturing people are struggling because of the same people they are praising. Nobody has told them, that its not coming back. This is 2018 not 1965. The world will change no matter how much 'they' promise
980 2018-12-19 22:26:56 I’m in wales although not a taff. I would be oil myself but it duscoulors so quick these days. Can’t beat the finish though
981 2018-12-19 22:26:41 I thinking my sissyness upsets folks. I do walk like I got oil wells pumping in my living room.
982 2018-12-19 22:26:40 Went to get the oil changed in my car nbd, and walked away with a Christmas present. Ohio is neat-o.
983 2018-12-19 22:26:34 野瀬フリートさんが黒幕なの微笑ましすぎるんだよな、、
984 2018-12-19 22:26:32 get a diffuser and put RC essence oil in it my sister was breathing easier in a day x
985 2018-12-19 22:26:32 But if you add a tariff equal to the equivalent climate/regulatory costs that CAN oil is subject to, I bet they would convert to CAN oil quickly.
986 2018-12-19 22:26:22 He put his daughters in an oil drum.                  Dreamboat.
987 2018-12-19 22:26:22 self-efficacent oil?
988 2018-12-19 22:26:14 Hoping the hole that the price of oil is falling through gets a little bit bigger so I can buy back in
989 2018-12-19 22:26:01 かわいい
990 2018-12-19 22:25:56 YOU SPEAK AGAINST ANOINTING OIL, YET A CROSS SYMBOL IS IN YOUR CHURCH ROOM..
991 2018-12-19 22:25:44 Hah, funnily enough, I took a picture of oil on water with a coloured light and the software tagged it as a space scene!
992 2018-12-19 22:25:35 I need a gas can &  2 cycle oil for my baby dirt bike 
993 2018-12-19 22:25:35 Yeah see a doctor :// thats a problem.
Also maybe look up squalene for moisturizer? Like 100% pure squalene products. It's what im using now bc EVERYTHING makes me break out and i havent had problems???? Mb jojoba oil too.
994 2018-12-19 22:25:34 Just watched this piece. I am now fucking raging. We are a rich country, we have plenty of billionaires on these islands, we have oil rigs off the coast and we have queues for food banks! This UC and austerity loving Tory party has to be booted out now.
995 2018-12-19 22:25:33 You mean like when he refused bi lateral talks in Argentina and have sanctioned them back to the Stone Age and is backing out of short range missles agreement. And have increased oil output that directly cripples Russia or increased defense spending??? Look at the big picture!
996 2018-12-19 22:25:30 Some people think climate change is a hard pill to swallow but it doesn't have shit on fish oil
997 2018-12-19 22:25:24 So w/o this power, no going after bad oil companies who pollute our air, land and water plus coal concerns. Way to softball climate change and new green deal. We want a new green deal to protect our planet
998 2018-12-19 22:25:20 Castor oil smell is unbearable I had to mix it with almond oil
999 2018-12-19 22:25:19 For those of you that have cars please ensure before having your bath in the morning or before going out with it take time to check your tire nuts ,engine oil, water but MOST ESPECIALLY YOUR TIRE NUTS.... thank you

1002 2018-12-19 22:25:10 No oil, butter, or water?
1003 2018-12-19 22:25:06 Nice. I prefer argan oil, it’s lighter and brighter but shea butter is good for proper tight curls
1004 2018-12-19 22:25:03 A) the oil for the pipeline is in Alberta and jobs will only come we are told through having that pipeline 
B) if the oil flows I presume that Alberta will be the major province to benefit.  Here in Ontario we are still bleeding jobs, GM Oshawa will close next year.
1005 2018-12-19 22:24:50 I feel sure that I read about this in the WTO Rules (Named after US University research Team ) TTIP  the "I" comes directly from WTO rules and is a modern version wanting a in Secret Court hearings. But there were two major examples,  Venezuela =Oil and Indonesia= mining
1006 2018-12-19 22:24:46 The rate hike in a time oil sales are down is just a way they make up losses don't freak ppl.
1007 2018-12-19 22:24:37 Oil, unironically the prize was control of a oil pipeline, because that is definitely worth the cost right?
1008 2018-12-19 22:24:21 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
1009 2018-12-19 22:24:19 if a warning a foot high had been printed on every fuel pump:

OIL KILLS PLANETS

does anyone seriously believe that it would have made the slightest difference to our consumption of the stuff?
1010 2018-12-19 22:24:18 For infusing butter or oil for making edibles, use only the leaves.
1011 2018-12-19 22:24:02 That’s what i use wile growth and i finished a bottle of hair nails vitimans i gotta get more. But i just got the oil. Thank you

1013 2018-12-19 22:23:58 Wow 1500 trucks in support of Alberta/Canadian oil. We are finally standing up and saying no more slapping us around. #ABLeg
1014 2018-12-19 22:23:53 Bore far enough you just might hit some oil. Elon’s long game?
1015 2018-12-19 22:23:52 Many products period contain palm oil. At least vegan companies source theirs ethically and vegan speak out for ethical palm oil consumption all the time. Unlike meat eaters.
1016 2018-12-19 22:23:44 Annoying as they keep whining about renewable 'subsidies' despite givng £5bn to Oil & Gas since 2010. Short sighted and idiotic; not even mentioning the political choice to stop subsidising onshore Wind specifically to hurt Scotland; where we produce the cheapest energy in Europe
1017 2018-12-19 22:23:35 The environment is not gonna improve with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon directly invest in oil exploration R&D
1018 2018-12-19 22:23:31 My cats wild. Anyone think CBD oil will chill her out in the am. She makes mad noise even if there’s food in her bowl
1019 2018-12-19 22:23:30 9. Now remember the twin issues that drive up this expenditure are 1. Our addiction to importation and penchant for racketeering 2. Price of crude oil that drives ideal pump price up above or below the fixed domestic market rate demanded by Nigeria’s spoilt middle class
1020 2018-12-19 22:23:29 Thankfully they can still count on eastern Canada buying their oil. It’s getting expensive to commit atrocities
1021 2018-12-19 22:23:22 Please try Full Spectrum CBD Oil...
Please please
Please

1022 2018-12-19 22:23:18 Misinformation? Have you read #CarbonTrust 2011 report where it appears this statement of fashion being the second most polluting industry after oil?
1023 2018-12-19 22:23:14 @timandsid   Doesn’t Quebec need oil to build arena, or buy a hockey team?  Or for day to day life?  We’ve got lots in the prairies..... and Quebec has 13 billion of our money.....
1024 2018-12-19 22:23:05 Wee bit of olive oil and butter, low.and slow, keep stirring. Man I want some now haha
1025 2018-12-19 22:23:01 Man oil could gain 300% from here on 95% of the companies and still look sexy

1031 2018-12-19 22:22:32 So if ISIS defeated why are the Russians still there? Oh right because of Assad & their oil pipeline deal! And who will protect the Kurdish fighters who aligned themselves with USA efforts because Assad & Russia certainly won’t! Merry Xmas Putin & Assad!
1032 2018-12-19 22:22:30 What I’ve started to do is stack argon oil ecostyler and honey & Shae design essentials (green). Wrapping your edges for as little as 5 minutes and your edges staying down ALL DAY. & I got some KINKY hair so it should work for you too

1037 2018-12-19 22:21:57 Has anyone asked the oil companies to ante up the funds necessary to create these jobs?  Why should taxpayers subsidize this type of industry when all common sense dictates the future is in clean energy?
1038 2018-12-19 22:21:49 i’ve yet to meet someone my age named bob. until just now when he changed my oil.

1041 2018-12-19 22:21:42 Here is Choppers reaction. What do you want, haven't you stolen enough oil already?
1042 2018-12-19 22:21:40 Sorry to burst your bubble Lanny.  I actually don’t work in the oil field! Don’t be so quick to judge you typical liberal hypocrite!
1043 2018-12-19 22:21:33 Long long ago I had read that the fight was over oil and gas pipeline access and had something perhaps to do with Turkey, and maybe Russia only has 'one port?"
1044 2018-12-19 22:21:26 Stop trying to deflect. There is a common denominator in #cdnpoli on Softwood Lumber, Steel, Aluminum, Dairy, Agriculture, Oil and Gas. #JustinTrudeau. He's in charge. Its his watch. Open your eyes.
1045 2018-12-19 22:21:22 I need an oil change
1046 2018-12-19 22:21:14 I have been told you can flush out Spooders with peppermint oil. Worst case charge the fucker rent, hes a freeloader.
1047 2018-12-19 22:21:10 Lol I just got an oil change for the first time ever.
1048 2018-12-19 22:21:08 Operators shouldn't complete horizontal wells unless oil can fetch $65 per barrel for 12 months
1049 2018-12-19 22:21:02 Yes it is. Oil money speaking loud and clear.
1050 2018-12-19 22:20:48 Are you buying the snake oil from the anti-Christ?

Do you know what "The Hastert Rule" is?
1051 2018-12-19 22:20:44 Get real. They aren't protesting "the previous Alberta govt" are they? Clearly, they're standing-up against the inaction of @JustinTrudeau's incompetent @liberal_party. No one "prepares" to be stabbed in the back.
Like it or not, oil & oil products are in high demand worldwide.

1056 2018-12-19 22:20:16 These groups of anarchists, communists been around for a while, spreading message used to be harder and ppl less receptive. Not as institutionally entrenched as today. Proselytizing requires much less effort,digital comms reinforce educational indoctrination
1057 2018-12-19 22:20:12 Many parts of it have been corroborated, specifically the Russian oil company sale for a specific percentage.
1058 2018-12-19 22:20:05 People are going crazy with the power out... calm the fuck down do y’all really think we’re goin back to the colonial days damn. Y’all actin like Thomas Edison bustin out cha damn oil lamps.

1060 2018-12-19 22:19:47 食パンさん、おはようございます
1061 2018-12-19 22:19:41 Quebec already gets more than 50% of its oil from western Canada. Get your facts straight, Mr. Scheer!
1062 2018-12-19 22:19:33 @juicyyyyjas Have you tried the Nourish Organic Eye Avocado and Argan Oil Treatment from Target? I'm obsessed. I think you'd like it

1064 2018-12-19 22:18:59 I refuse to believe for ONE GAWD DAMN SECOND man city have luck of the draw. These oil merchants keep on getting easy draws in every competition. @FIFAcom @FA investigate these fools
1065 2018-12-19 22:18:59 Those tankers helped me to I can assure. Amazing sight  when they come out of the gate right in front of you . Sounds strange but a real adrenaline buzz as I'm sure others who've been there will agree. There's no bull. Just a huge Tanker full of oil facing you. The end product.
1066 2018-12-19 22:18:56 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
1067 2018-12-19 22:18:52 If they want to talk green.  How much greenhouse gases are produced by sending a constant flow of oil down a pipe VS. Sending it by 40tonne truck loads. Driving and Idling in truck yards while the drivers sleep. If they want to talk green. Then a pipeline is probably the cleanest
1068 2018-12-19 22:18:44 But he said he was just using the lavender oil to “calm his nerves”

1071 2018-12-19 22:18:23 that's what I'm worried about. But if they can make one transformers movie where a robot doesn't urinate oil on someone, I think we've all won.
1072 2018-12-19 22:18:07 Shout out to @WilsonCoMtrs for fixing my window problem, quick oil change & tire rotation! The Trax is ready to roll!
1073 2018-12-19 22:18:06 I roast my Brussel sprouts tossed in a little olive oil with chopped red onions, beef sausage link sliced and maple bacon. It is so good!!!
1074 2018-12-19 22:18:06 use the medium setting on warm and some coconut oil
1075 2018-12-19 22:17:58 Here near New Hamburg I have all of those. Being cheap, I've restricted them to black oil sunflower seeds so far this year.  I sometimes cave in and buy some peanuts if/when it gets really cold. No red-headed woodpeckers here either for many years.
1076 2018-12-19 22:17:51 Or smothering in olive oil 
1077 2018-12-19 22:17:42 I am continually impressed by how effective an anti-inflammatory and mild painkiller CBD oil is, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.
1078 2018-12-19 22:17:38 Yep .. we currently subsidise Scotland as the oil in costuming money. Three reasons Scotland cannot go to EU. 1) Debt Ratio 2) Euro 3) They would go broke.

1083 2018-12-19 22:17:04 I need 4 new tires & a oil change
1084 2018-12-19 22:17:03 Water dries. Use oil if you dig the look. 

Then everyone will know you’re REALLY committed to it.
1085 2018-12-19 22:17:02 Ooh I love a good oil tanker pin up!
1086 2018-12-19 22:17:01 Yo u ever smelt the oil off someone’s hair 
1087 2018-12-19 22:16:45 City paid @Carabao_Cup off. Oil money FC
1088 2018-12-19 22:16:31 Need an oil change and my blinker fluid refilled 
1089 2018-12-19 22:16:23 We played Premiership team in every round that shows these draws a fixed Russian Arab Oil making the draw crude slimey
1090 2018-12-19 22:16:12 1)Holodomor was a famine, not a genocide, caused by drought and embargo on the trade of russian oil(which made grain the only product left to be exported) 2)The Khmer Rouge had no characteristic of a communist state, were funded by the cia and were stopped by vietnam.
1091 2018-12-19 22:16:06 Looking back at my Railway career I know I worked the Adelante Fleet but the mainstay for me was the HST and I clocked up 5+ Years on Unrefurbished Buffets and ....Heard, Got Showered by oil, & Smoked out by Valenta power units lol
1092 2018-12-19 22:16:05 #Libya's #oil #fields #reopened #oott
1093 2018-12-19 22:15:57 The biggest fraud from the ff industry was to support the concept of “peak oil”. An only slight less fraudulent claim is that the CO2 from that oil is causing climate change. Ya just can’t “trust ‘em.”  They’ll do anything to keep energy prices high.
1094 2018-12-19 22:15:55 Well, it's not just Alberta of course.  Oil literally drives the cars you buy, so don't be too hard on the effort.  We all know big money is not really found in Canada but often is found offshore.  We are a blip of population that sits on a mega resource.
1095 2018-12-19 22:15:51 @FirestoneAuto NEVER AGAIN. Went in for you to redo my oil change. You put the wrong oil drain plug so the oil is dripping right on a pipe (the burning smell I have had). Dearlership has to drain the oil and do a new oil change since I wouldn't take my car back to you. $130!!!!
1096 2018-12-19 22:15:45 City paid @Carabao_Cup off. Oil money FC
1097 2018-12-19 22:15:35 Well awesome. Is Airswift the gas and oil refinery there in Houston or Baytown? Or just the offices?
1098 2018-12-19 22:15:31 i don't think so, it depends on the oil. If the oil is liquid enough then yeah
1099 2018-12-19 22:15:15 Treating my yeast infection naturally with some tea tree oil. Pro tip: don’t get it in your urethra.
1100 2018-12-19 22:15:11 Oil money for you
1101 2018-12-19 22:15:03 Jealous of oil 
1102 2018-12-19 22:15:02 You do realize that it was that run by your daughter's employer, right? The one that went around spending foundation money on oil portraits of its namesake, refurbishing his business' fountain, making political donations, paying personal lawsuit settlements?
1103 2018-12-19 22:14:59 How many times do I have to shampoo my hair before the coconut oil comes out? I've got a training course tomorrow with some people I'd quite like to give me a job and no amount of dry shampoo or fairy liquid is gonna fix this.
1104 2018-12-19 22:14:55 Bloomberg always speaks the truth about Tesla... They literally pay staff to come up with market moving headlines. The pay them a bonus for it.
Please, use google on your sources. It's the media. And Tesla's downfall means money for big oil and short sellers (market moving.)
1105 2018-12-19 22:14:52 The bourgeoisie keeps more, yet for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
1106 2018-12-19 22:14:49 Pollution is always costed with by any reputable organization..its called Cost Benefit Analysis..if it's not being done it should be offset   by the tremendous benefits of Oil.
1107 2018-12-19 22:14:36 I used tea tree oil on my face today, during my skin routine and omg its fucking amazing
1108 2018-12-19 22:14:20 oil fields will go to the regime, that is for sure
1109 2018-12-19 22:14:17 They do not have the first clue how the oil market works
1110 2018-12-19 22:14:10 I've got a cracking one from our oil delivery company if you'd like it.
1111 2018-12-19 22:14:04 I never want them to win the champions league, ever! I want to hold that over them for as long as...well the oil eventually runs out
1112 2018-12-19 22:14:02 Of course they said we had proof. We had billions to gain in oil and natural gas revenue by ousting Assad, as well as expanded geopolitical influence. Oil was also the reason for Afghanistan.
1113 2018-12-19 22:13:51 A Hunchbacked Baker quibbles with a suspicious-looking fellow over a softly chittering oil painting depicting a maroon pair of gloves.
1114 2018-12-19 22:13:37 Scotland would have left the EU in March 2016 had the SNP won the independence referendum. And by now we in Scotland would be in meltdown with no fiscal transfer from the UK and no oil revenues, no currency and no central bank.
1115 2018-12-19 22:13:36 I say the feds pull the 1.6 billion and invest it in hydro electricity in Manitoba - sorry the time for oil is ending and it’s time Alberta adjust the way it lives and thinks.
1116 2018-12-19 22:13:34 Just passed the convoy of trucks on the Henday.
I’m in full support of our #Alberta truckers, our #Oil Industry & our need to get our products to domestic & foreign markets. 
Wishing the best, during these trying times, to all our hard working Albertans during the Holiday season.
1117 2018-12-19 22:13:32 I can do ‘86 oil slump and ‘87 crash (you left out Japan 1989) in addition....
1118 2018-12-19 22:13:30 i put lavender AND lemon oil in my diffuser and wow lemme tell you,,,, i’m in heaven
1119 2018-12-19 22:13:25 gonna need a bigger City bingo board - "fixed cup draws" will go nicely beside "oil money" and "league 2".
1120 2018-12-19 22:13:19 so it imports MOST of its oil from the US.  is that MORE than it imports from the rest of Canada or after Western Canada?
1121 2018-12-19 22:13:16 I need a new oil to put in my beard ....slick tired of smelling castor oil any suggestions (not coconut oil)
1122 2018-12-19 22:13:15 When I die I want my body hidden inside a Walmart so I can finally Rest In Peace
1123 2018-12-19 22:12:55 The hub of the Oil & Gas industry.  My company has a facility there.
1124 2018-12-19 22:12:51 tutorial:

put a lip balm you chosen then put on coconut oil

- get a q tip mix the sparkly eyeshadow or highlighter onto your lips.

your lips will be poppin and glistening under the sun 
1125 2018-12-19 22:12:47 And in turn, big oil will to
1126 2018-12-19 22:12:45 Just taking the day off. Taking some time for myself and hobbies. I have an oil painting I want to work some more on.
1127 2018-12-19 22:12:44 Cucumbers, tomatoes, with spinach on toasted honey oats wheat bread with olive oil 
1128 2018-12-19 22:12:38 I'll be ordering some here after Christmas. We have so many places around me that sell cbd oil, but their prices and quality is crap. So I'm waiting to get some from you.
1129 2018-12-19 22:12:35 Oil situation needs to be sorted. Wouldn't mind getting some money for him in January
1130 2018-12-19 22:12:33 I can't believe that even one Quebecer said that they would rather get there oil from somewhere other than Alberta.
1131 2018-12-19 22:12:25 I'm a quebecer and like a majority we want Canada's oil. Only politicians and the medias are against and a couple of coucouloocs.
1132 2018-12-19 22:12:24 obsに音声モニターできる昨日あるのでやってみると良いかもです！
1133 2018-12-19 22:12:18 @FoxNews @TheFive  Time for @PeteHegseth to change the oil in his hair!
1134 2018-12-19 22:12:12 "A few days at least! Did you put it in butter or oil?" He asked, carefully putting the rest of the cookie down.
1135 2018-12-19 22:12:07 I just use coconut oil or miceller water on some cloth, I’m not trying to fuck up the environment even more
1136 2018-12-19 22:11:57 Pretty sure the thing in the fish tissue I was trying to identify is ...
Fish oil. The spectra matches icosapent closer than anything else.

So with some certainty I can say that fish do in fact contain fish oil

Yay
1137 2018-12-19 22:11:53 The rebels are known for staging photos, such as "ambulance boy". Why would Assad suddenly violate the Geneva convention while the rebels were losing and inspectors left? It makes no sense for him to do this. The US Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, had oil interests to protect
1138 2018-12-19 22:11:31 As may fish with a bird Taraprashad, faith; of us, by heaven! O heat, extinct in which their trauma and olive oil Ay, so,
1139 2018-12-19 22:11:28 On a separate note, if Russia is serious bout the Venezuela air base then complete oil boycott on VEZ happens licketysplit
1140 2018-12-19 22:11:26 Nat gas looking fun too.. making a video on oil and ng soon?
1141 2018-12-19 22:11:19 Oil money has fixed the tie and probably the results as well......it was revealed yesterday!
1142 2018-12-19 22:11:19 おはよ……ぼくはおねむだよ……
1143 2018-12-19 22:11:16 @albertaNDP Is there an Alberta law prohibiting the Oil & Gas industry from hiring overseas engineers when the unemployment rate is so high for local engineers meeting at least most of the criteria? Otherwise, we're adding more unemployed when the industry gets another hit.
1144 2018-12-19 22:11:13 What the heck is ‘palm oil’ ? 
1145 2018-12-19 22:11:11 “Data is the new oil” is both more correct and a much worse marketing tagline than you thought it was.
1146 2018-12-19 22:11:06 Look into Rick Simpson oil.
1147 2018-12-19 22:11:04 I like the cracked pepper and olive oil ones.
1148 2018-12-19 22:11:00 おはようごさいます
本日もよろしくです
1149 2018-12-19 22:10:47 It’s because of lobbyists and the guy want to just bomb the oil? It’s labor, and it’s really cheating. States, and all of this nation.
1150 2018-12-19 22:10:44 Bring them home ! Why are we letting these leaders play toy soldiers with real people's lives ??? Go fuck yourselves ! If you want to fight go out and fight yourselves ! Your argument is not our argument ! You still live while we die , for who ? And for what ? Oil ? Sick shit !!!
1151 2018-12-19 22:10:44 What ever the reason, if they completely withdraw, dismantle their bases there, [in the oil rich section of Syria btw], good. Russia was invited in by Syria, US there illegally. Russia more interested in stopping isis et al reaching Russia.
1152 2018-12-19 22:10:43 And we need to stop old growth logging on Vancouver Island and stop logging for paper, cattle feed, cattle grazing and palm oil.
1153 2018-12-19 22:10:41 It is not the energy sector. It is the oil and gas sector.
1154 2018-12-19 22:10:19 Came in for an oil change. Left with a new vehicle.....several hours later 
1155 2018-12-19 22:10:19 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
1156 2018-12-19 22:10:12 Oil, empty stadiums, oil, stuff, vitriol, no history blah blah repeat, repeat!!!
1157 2018-12-19 22:10:12 Just imagine; 1 year from now Mike Pence will be President, Andrew Scheer will be PM of Canada, and Jason Kenny will be Premier of Alberta. A pipeline in every yard, there won't be enough oil to keep up. Dare to dream folks.....
1158 2018-12-19 22:10:09 I saw the clip come up but didn't bother watching it.. Lol.. Fucking oil money
1159 2018-12-19 22:10:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Pringles Cheddar Cheese this December? With less than 2% actual Cheddar Cheese, it has more salt, oil or MSG!
1160 2018-12-19 22:10:06 I heard this catch phrase from my brother @abugzi: Data is the new oil and the cartels are Facebook, IG, Messenger, WhatsApp and partner firms. 

We are simply the product.
1161 2018-12-19 22:10:04 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1162 2018-12-19 22:09:59 No it’s oil and gas agency I’m a client service associate
1163 2018-12-19 22:09:51 Let me break it down for those struggling. 1. NNPC has a mandate to engage in ALL petroleum activities - production, transportation, processing and sales of gas and crude oil on behalf of Nigeria. It can make money on one commodity and use it to make up loss on another.
1164 2018-12-19 22:09:47 And the bidding of 65% of Americans who don’t want their troops in perpetual wars for oil. But yes.. Russia. 
Let me guess.. Medicare for all is “pie in the sky” and incrementalism is the way to go? @JimmyDoreShow
1165 2018-12-19 22:09:43 Oil spill on jvlr route going towards Powai from Jogeshwari barely a kilometre before Powai lake..unsafe for bikers especially @smart_mumbaikar @MumbaiPolice
1166 2018-12-19 22:09:40 Yeah I was thinking about that..! Could be, but I’m still confused about the little particles that were reflecting? When I’ve seen oil do that, it had more of a slick texture that sorta grouped into lil’ glops. This looks like lil individual pieces? Idk what I’m saying lol
1167 2018-12-19 22:09:39 So I was at cost plus and got a jar of sardines for my dads stocking per usual AND MY BASKET GOT HEAVY AND I DROPPED IT AND THE JAR SHATTERED AND MY WINE AND EVERYTHING WAS COVERED IN FISHY OLIVE OIL.
1168 2018-12-19 22:09:39 Pep guardiola and his Oil overlords are a bunch of frauds
1169 2018-12-19 22:09:33 Talibans were freedom fighters as long as they were against Russia, when they turned against US, they became terrorist, same people doing same kind of killing. They visited Texas,US to negotiate oil pipeline deal from central Asia through Afghanistan. Do some research on that
1170 2018-12-19 22:09:24 Maybe she used shark oil to baff
1171 2018-12-19 22:09:20 #If you want the truth, read your KJV Bible. If you want to learn how to rightly divide God's living Word, then you should engage in study with Shepherds Chapel and get some oil in your lamp and become a sword in God's right hand.             Amen, Branch
1172 2018-12-19 22:09:17 Wow. @ggreenwald ?
1173 2018-12-19 22:09:16 How much did they pay you. Oil money FC
1174 2018-12-19 22:09:00 Oil needs to come back into this team
1175 2018-12-19 22:08:57 THEY HAVE OIL!!
1176 2018-12-19 22:08:51 Do you really think we can survive climate change by increasing oil and gas burning? Impossible.
1177 2018-12-19 22:08:49 I've been reminded why I don't go to Jiffy Lube for oil changes. Ridiculous.
1178 2018-12-19 22:08:48 *Dad took my car to get an oil change* 
Dad: *signs the receipt with “XMAS”
“You can wrap this and put it under the tree as one of your Christmas presents.” 
1179 2018-12-19 22:08:34 You see this 2019 #budget eeh
If #oil price drops futher, next rainy season will be dry for Nigeria.
Take a luk @ the budget & its oil price bench mark forecast $60 and the current price of d product in the global market $46,u will grab the shortsightedness of your Kwauntry.
1180 2018-12-19 22:08:29 surely with corporate welfare, and long term environmental issues (who knows what cost to the taxpayer), the oil and gas industry produce even less for the GDP?
The cleanup will be massive, and don't expect business to chip in, plus they're trying to con taxpayers for pipeline!
1181 2018-12-19 22:08:28 This was a good and productive exchange. Sorry to see ya leave man!
1182 2018-12-19 22:08:23 おはまる
1183 2018-12-19 22:08:20 Damn. I’m really walking into 2019 and still ain’t one beard oil brand hit me up for sponsored posts?
1184 2018-12-19 22:08:15 for sparkly lips

you will need:

-nice lip balm
-coconut oil 
-sparkly eyeshadow
-highlighter
1185 2018-12-19 22:08:05 Most young bucks don’t know what a market crash in stawks even looks like.

It’s been 10 years! I was only an intern then and now I’m retired 

In REAL CRASH co-workers will be shitting bricks n burning midnight oil in fear of getting canned 

Buy the dip will be blasphemy.
1186 2018-12-19 22:08:04 Omg I’m getting an oil change rn too I feel the same way 
1187 2018-12-19 22:07:55 Use body oil— your skin will thank you 
1188 2018-12-19 22:07:45 Except the Golan + oil fields E of Euphrates n whatever else we can steal for Israel n the Kurds
1189 2018-12-19 22:07:38 What was once a run-down old state capitol building is now Austin's HOTTEST new condo and holistic essential oil vape emporium!
1190 2018-12-19 22:07:34 Already no Craig Bellamy told us last night fixed that’s what oil money buys you 
1191 2018-12-19 22:07:27 Absolutely I was out of olive oil too so it actually worked out in my favor.
1192 2018-12-19 22:07:23 "66% of Quebecers prefer to get oil from Western Canada, versus 7% who want it from the US.

45% think the pipeline is the safest means to transport oil, far ahead of the other options (14% for tanker trucks, 13% for trains, and 9% for boats)."

#cdnpoli
1193 2018-12-19 22:07:22 That oil money is looooooonnggg. City have drawn Schalke and BURTON  ALBION in the cups . Bloody hell.
1194 2018-12-19 22:07:11 Yeah right. You wouldn’t want to put poison in the body of someone you love. Coke can clean an oil stain off your driveway, why would anyone want to drink this shit?
1195 2018-12-19 22:07:10 Middle class will also get the same benefits when they become the third class. Are you care about more of the high class, as a fan of BJP you do so. They also didn't care about the commoners as before by imposing demoni..,hi oil pr, n even fmr hang themslvs perforce. U too 1this.
1196 2018-12-19 22:07:10 Patience and Ole Miss fans are two things that mix like oil and water
1197 2018-12-19 22:07:02 That would be my pick, but Oil Can is a wildcard.
1198 2018-12-19 22:06:55 @Christelle_2104 wow wow wow
You called city Burton yesterday ....
Arab oil money buying cup draws now ....... Craig Bellamy fucked up......
Why was this not big news
1199 2018-12-19 22:06:44 It did air on the noon. We led the show with the story and oil and gas stories made up the first 6 minutes of the show. If you missed it, more will be on at 5 & 6 and we have web stories up for whenever is convenient for you.
1200 2018-12-19 22:06:38 I mean, like, I'm proposing that we don't let assholes into the baseball hall of fame. If you're super duper transphobic, you probably shouldn't be there...it send a really hostile message towards trans people.
1201 2018-12-19 22:06:32 Tax vice!  We love oil, we love booze, we love tobacco. They are bad for us. So we tax them. It disincentivizes consumption and collects revenues that can be used offset the public health costs. Then subsidize good behavior. Maybe gym memberships, solar, veggies? It works!
1202 2018-12-19 22:06:24 Me. Over hurr with my dirt tasting CBD oil LMAO...
1203 2018-12-19 22:06:22 Did you know we currently have THC infused Olive Oil in stock? Come by and check out what we've got at Herbs R Us located 108-223 W Broadway
1204 2018-12-19 22:06:20 putting lavender oil in my bath is hands down one of the best things I’ve done this year
1205 2018-12-19 22:06:20 And use oil to put out a water fire
1206 2018-12-19 22:06:09 Climbed into sauna, hoping to sweat and to inhale the breath ease oil for my lungs. — sauna time
1207 2018-12-19 22:06:06 it’s gonna stick a little as it cooks but if you wanna put some oil in there only do like a capful
1208 2018-12-19 22:06:06 Obviously you don't know anything about oil production.
1209 2018-12-19 22:06:00 personally I wouldnt  go against the trend on oil... i would wait n short the rally after int 2 is done....
1210 2018-12-19 22:05:55 All these cbd oil companies are plugging their products in the replies like. Give me a discount maybe.......
1211 2018-12-19 22:05:48 Oh GOSH. Elderberry Syrup, Oregano Oil, TONS of water and sleep is all I got. Get better!!
1212 2018-12-19 22:05:47 Discovering crude oil is d worst thing that happened to our country. 

We generally stopped thinking
1213 2018-12-19 22:05:47 騎士…ナイツオブ…うっ頭が
1214 2018-12-19 22:05:41 Just think how quick the price went up when ever there is some kind of bad event taking place, then you see the oil@price drop so much and you won’t feel it until a week later... how does that work? But that’s not trumps problem. I’ll blame it on the system.
1215 2018-12-19 22:05:36 Do you need help calming down from it??  I know 80 people I went to school with that have an essential oil for it

1217 2018-12-19 22:05:17 Why are you denying Raymond Kemble of Dimock clean water to which he is entitled to by right under Title 58 §3218 of the Oil and Gas Act?

1219 2018-12-19 22:04:54 Also taking subsidies from oil gas & electric and put it toward solar programs to get businesses apartments and certain home owners to get solar. Its CHEAPER and cleaner. There are many things that can be done if you actually look into it&stop buying the right wing propoganda b.s
1220 2018-12-19 22:04:51 Oil change or dog park?
1221 2018-12-19 22:04:49 Furthermore, I think it's very telling that you responded to an argument about inclusivity with economic data. It's not an actual response...
1222 2018-12-19 22:04:47 In my day we had to pay to work in a steel mill, privacy was for the weak, you had to kill and butcher your own lunch & all the snake oil was the good old-fashioned capitalist genetically modified kind. 17 feet long and bright orange the snakes were. Tell me where we went wrong?!
1223 2018-12-19 22:04:43 I think you have to remember that an enormous percentage of the Alberta population is directly effected by these pipelines not being built and the economic and social hardships are piling up quickly in the oil and gas sector. It's time for this. It's past time for this!!!
1224 2018-12-19 22:04:43 Oil independence was started way before Trump, and no, it wasn’t the lowest gas price. I believe that it almost went down to less then 2 during Obama era too, all of these things is in the hands of the few elites... I call them monopoly!
1225 2018-12-19 22:04:41 I am an environmentalist but also a realist. I know Oil is used in most products. Some plastics can be replaced with others products like bamboo etc... but I know we still need it. Just would like to see us not burn it. It’s a waste of a valuable  resource.

1228 2018-12-19 22:04:30 Can I be schooled on the genesis of rice and oil as Christmas gifts to workers ????
1229 2018-12-19 22:04:18 Life Hack: 
Shoes smell from overtime? Take an essential oil and put drops in the shoe after you take your soles out.
1230 2018-12-19 22:04:16 Ordered me a set of hair clippers and some beard oil.. let's see how it goes lol
1231 2018-12-19 22:04:03 No
It’s often soiled with oil from the cheese or crust smothered in olive oil
1232 2018-12-19 22:03:49 And on the oil question I used to engage people on that a lot. People often say they can't give up oil or cut down on oil consumption. That's not true.
1233 2018-12-19 22:03:38 I might suggest if @RachelNotley wants THAT pipeline, first thing she should do is get all those BCers out of Albertan oil/gas. Then @jjhorgan might get a better idea of the need for the pipeline if he's faced with unemployed BC workers. Everyone I know in industry are from BC
1234 2018-12-19 22:03:37 I seriously doubt that Assad would gas his own people. It makes no sense for him to do this. Syria and Afghanistan were both oil wars. We need to become self-sufficient and keep our troops out of the Middle East.

1236 2018-12-19 22:03:31 Even 66% of Quebecers agree that they should get oil from western Canada & 45% think the pipeline is the safest means to transport oil, far ahead of the other options.

1240 2018-12-19 22:03:13 guys my therapist just suggested using cbd oil for my anxiety so i’m  to get a vape
1241 2018-12-19 22:03:12 Middle class will also get the same benefits when they become the third class. Are you care about more of the high class, as a fan of BJP you do so. They also didn't care about the commoners as before by imposing demoni..,hi oil pr, n even fmr hang themslvs perforce. U too 1this.
1242 2018-12-19 22:03:08 Yes  I always get a nasty rash that looks red, swollen and sore on my wrist. Even if I take it off for a shower ect. I’ve put clear nail varnish on the metals & use some Bio Oil gel on my skin but  just won’t go away 
1243 2018-12-19 22:03:06 And we need to stop deforestation like old growth logging on Vancouver Island. And no more logging for paper, palm oil, for feed growing like soy, cattle grazing in the Amazon, and so on.

1247 2018-12-19 22:02:59 Hahahaha.. you are very correct... The Clever Zimbos want govt to manufacture cooking oil... They have zero ambition to start their own businesses... Most busineses in rural Zim are run by folks with limited education

Do you really beleive that yankee will leave the country full of oil fields without their "friendship" and "democracy"???
Never.
1254 2018-12-19 22:02:23 Looks great for your first attempt! I liked oil painting, but hated mixing color; always wasted paint trying to get it right.

1259 2018-12-19 22:02:01 There's a reason almost all mainstream media eventually pivots towards including those groups, instead of continuing to ostracize them.
1260 2018-12-19 22:01:56 You can bet your bottom dollar, had energy east had the oil depot in a town like Levi's or another on the St Lawrence seaway, construction would be well underway. This is not about " dirty oil" it is about $$$$

1262 2018-12-19 22:01:45 Enormously happy. Iran want influence and control over the region. Russia is an ally to Iran. Oil and natural gas are the regions main assets and both need money badly.
1263 2018-12-19 22:01:44 Now that he doesn’t have to rely on Big Oil campaign contributions.
1264 2018-12-19 22:01:43 Canada has the cleanest most regulated oil which could serve the entire country of Canada.  Instead we rely on Saudi Arabia and America.  Our natural resources are actually national security resources.  Currently those resources are being sold for pennies on the dollar.
1265 2018-12-19 22:01:35 turns out a big splash of hot oil on a whole area of your hand hurts like fucking hell!
1266 2018-12-19 22:01:33 And then you can set the oil on fire and watch it burn for days 
1267 2018-12-19 22:01:26 The first oil painters...Van Eyck and Van Der Wayden...they created some really powerful images.
1268 2018-12-19 22:01:25 We don't. We are now the largest oil producer in the world, surpassing Russia & Saudi Arabia, thanks to Pres Trump. Obama did everything he could to prevent it. #MAGA

1270 2018-12-19 22:01:16 Yes you are pretty trying to dictate what I should do.  I'm pointing out the flaws in those demands and I'm pointing out the problem when you overlook even worse problems with oil cos. That article doesn't show FB officially supports neo-Nazis. Read my other posts in the thread
1271 2018-12-19 22:01:15 I mean, yeah, I don't really believe that baseball is dying. However, I do believe that refusing to cultivate an atmosphere around baseball that is both welcoming and nurturing of historically marginalized groups is a bad move.
1272 2018-12-19 22:01:09 Alberta Canada,does not want welfare from Mr Dressup,ie : Trudeau they want a pipeline to move their Oil & Gas to world markets.
1273 2018-12-19 22:01:09 Who voted for this ???   Oil industry getting crushed and Nenshi helping.
1274 2018-12-19 22:00:59 The U.S. had increased oil production of 1.5 million barrels a year. We are the largest oil producer in the world. This actually hurts Russia & we don’t have anything to protect by being there.
1275 2018-12-19 22:00:57 Personal data is the oil of the 21st century, a resource worth billions to those who can most effectively extract and refine it. American companies alone are expected to spend close to $20 billion by the end of 2018 to acquire and process consumer data, according to the @iab
1276 2018-12-19 22:00:57 Thank you President Trump for bringing our SERVICE MEN & WOMEN home. Now we don't have to be the POLICE FORCE for OIL COMPANIES in Syria like GENIE OIL & GAS!

1278 2018-12-19 22:00:50 Set rules in his last 6 months of office? Are we producing less because of that? The point is oil fracking has done more damage to the environment than anything Trump did, and not just here, but also in Europe where the United States has been pushing oil fracking aggressively.
1279 2018-12-19 22:00:47 It took me way too long to find the correct oil filter for my wife's car.  Autozone gave me the part number, Amazon said that was incorrect. Amazon was incorrect, but $2 cheaper. Amazon got the sale.

1281 2018-12-19 22:00:43 Replacing meat (especially beef) with Quorn,  for example, is not more harmful than eating meet. Quorn use free range eggs, sustainable palm oil, they are removing plastic from packaging and it’s made 2 hours away from where I live so has low transport impact

1286 2018-12-19 22:00:28 The least persuasive argument the rest of Canada has against rising Alberta separatist sentiment is: “If you dare leave we will land-lock your oil even worse than we are doing it now!” That just pisses people off. #cdnpoli #abpoli

1292 2018-12-19 21:59:47 Ohhhh I worked on those 2 pics 
On the beetle I just applied a basic deep blue n purple fill in technique n then I used an oil paint technique (green, then purple). I'm learning as I go
1293 2018-12-19 21:59:38 My comments were addressed to Brett Wilson, who is a climate denier, part of the 1% and has oil investments. I don't see how it implied to others.
1294 2018-12-19 21:59:31 Don’t all plants built (and run with fuel) put money in private pockets also?  Just running a coal or oil/gas-based generator send money to the miners/oil companies?
1295 2018-12-19 21:59:25 You are correct . We have shale oil and gas in not just Oilsands but no pipeline capacity to export and no appetite to sell this product in our own country . Messed up . Go try and buy BC wine or AB made beer in LCBO . If you find it will be limited . France fill your boots
1296 2018-12-19 21:59:25 What is undeniable is that Beto spoke about the need for creating better paying green jobs and the threat of climate change at his campaign rallies across the state. So that’s what they voted for. I don’t see why it’s hard to imagine an oil worker preferring green energy jobs.
1297 2018-12-19 21:59:23 You are totally right,its the cant shoot straight crowd in alberta,tommy gave sask medicare,Aberhart gave  AB eugenics,,PET wanted to make  a Canadian oil cartel,Lougheed gave the whole oilfield to the americans,then cretien defended CWB,and Harper gave it to Saudis.
1298 2018-12-19 21:59:22 Your predictions are spot on, just amazing …Having a great day myself. I reloaded some short ETFs this morning. Didn't buy much, was hopping for a higher market bounce. Still made good money :)  I bought some  USO yesterday afternoon. In your opinion, is oil bottoming out ?
1299 2018-12-19 21:59:16 so what are you, Elon's olive oil?
1300 2018-12-19 21:59:13 I don’t see oil mentioned. That’s interesting.

1312 2018-12-19 21:56:59 I think Creon should add taking a dose with cannabis in oil to increase absorption. I get better results that way. I now add my CBD isolate powder to a small amount of thc tincture in oil and use sublingual and then swallow. I find a little THC with my 470mg dose of CBD helps.
1313 2018-12-19 21:56:55 The oil industry is also destroying the environment.. time to enter the here and now and embrace the alternative energies
1314 2018-12-19 21:56:47 You opposed to taking it to an oil change shop?
1315 2018-12-19 21:56:46 You snake oil vendor.
1316 2018-12-19 21:56:38 Iran is Republican and Israeli obsession. Democrats would have kept to the nuclear deal and made other attempts to reconcile with Iran. Iran will continue to evolve under pressure of vast post oil change. Nothing inevitable about theocratic govt in Iran. Future of I is in Asia.

1318 2018-12-19 21:56:23 Great if they follow through with the plan. Syria can have their oil back. Guess that ISIS camp near US troops will leave too.
1319 2018-12-19 21:56:16 2nd, it was about forcing Alberta to sell to refineries at a substantial discount to the world market price. All Alberta did was say not to stealing the resource, and let the market run free. The same could be said today, if the market was allowed to transport the oil east.
1320 2018-12-19 21:56:08 The “political Solution”
Russia coming into war to keep the status quo. 
Just as the soviét union did in 67 and 73 , to win the region control. after loosing that 
They Made the oil price jump to the SKY and the árabs countries started to buy Europe til today . No news, at all!
1321 2018-12-19 21:56:08 They’re mad because we fought 15 years just for oil, and now we’re throwing away the oil

You decide if that’s bad. I don’t care that much but I’m afraid A)the next president will send us back in so this is a mistake and B)Russia would be even worse for human rights there
1322 2018-12-19 21:56:04 Vicks on your feet with double socks? Shower vapor tabs from CVS? Medicine ball tea from Starbucks? Thieves oil on your neck?

1325 2018-12-19 21:55:44 Try some cauliflower steamed and then tossed warm in olive oil w a little anchovy paste and allowed to reach room temperature and then talk to me.
1326 2018-12-19 21:55:38 yes please tell us about how endless wars with no solutions is a good thing? Neocons like you may get off of all the wars we are involved in but the rest of us are tired of them. let the middle east go to war we don't need their oil anymore.
1327 2018-12-19 21:55:33 Treated myself to a massage today..the sweet lady just put oil on me and rubbed it around. I’m sad
1328 2018-12-19 21:55:27 Good question. I get mine from a chef I know. 

You can get truffle Olive oil from supper markets, and it's not bad tbh.
1329 2018-12-19 21:55:27 So basicly you want to allowed Iran and syria to gain Controll about the oil and sell it to the Chinese so that China can dethrown the US. What a traitor
1330 2018-12-19 21:55:19 Watching Jamie Oliver pour Italy's entire reserve of extra virgin olive oil on everything he cooks
1331 2018-12-19 21:55:19 The real issue is taking Saudi Oil vs Canadian
1332 2018-12-19 21:55:17 Es q además los activos están ahí y TPL no tiene apalancamiento operativo, es decir, si el oil baja, se espera a q se recupere el precio, las reservas no van a desaparecer. Mientras tanto, a recomprar acciones.
1333 2018-12-19 21:55:13 My skin is so sensitive I have to use an oil cleanser ... the type with a water activated emulsifier. Oil takes it all off so gently but then wet it and it turns milky & washes off with no residue. I do have a bottle of micella water for real can’t get out of bed emergencies.
1334 2018-12-19 21:55:09 I just got Jake a free $75 dollar oil change and what does he do for me??? 
Forget his card at home and make me pay for his coffee
1335 2018-12-19 21:55:07 Go get an oil change instead of being a lazy fuck.
1336 2018-12-19 21:55:03 Not so much (I don't think) but you also have to give the freshly cut area some TLC. Dirt, oil etc can block it stopping the from breaking through. It's a whole process than just the cut
1337 2018-12-19 21:54:44 Good luck with that. There's oil in the east already. You just what to sell Alberta oil. 
That existing pipeline will be shut down way before any new one is installed.
1338 2018-12-19 21:54:40 Yes, we bought the existing pipeline with the hope to expand it.

There are no Eastward pipelines. Energy Easy did not make economic sense or environmental sense.

There’s a world glut of oil. There’s is no evidence a pipeline would make the price go up.
1339 2018-12-19 21:54:38 Or accepting Saudi Oil!
1340 2018-12-19 21:54:38 Take a LOT of fish oil daily
1341 2018-12-19 21:54:34 You may use it but since we started to use sea foam in our gas no more fuel pumps and carb issues. Maybe I am a broken record but we run ours lots. Had a 30 hp and it was a rock 5/30syn oil year round and always the winter air kits. Running 3-35’s now and great all winter long.
1342 2018-12-19 21:54:31 What does building refineries have to do with where a given refinery gets it's oil from??
AB rejected the NEB because it was about stealing the ownership of the resource from the Province and giving it to the Federal government. All provinces would stand to lose if that happens.

1345 2018-12-19 21:54:22 Came To Get An Oil Change Real Quick & They Talking About Some Stuff I Said Nope Don’t Want It & Called My Dad With The Quickness 
1346 2018-12-19 21:54:21 Oil daw... salt and pepper daw... goes in smooth pero hapdi af 
1347 2018-12-19 21:54:09 People who argue we “need” to open up drilling in the Arctic to transition away from Saudi oil...

No, we need to transition away from fossil fuels completely...and NOW!!!

1349 2018-12-19 21:54:08 So my sinuses are congested so I decided to put a nice lil essential oil diffuser in my room with some stuff to help my sinuses. Problem is.... I’m still stuffed up but now MY EYES ARE CONSTANTLY WATERING?

1352 2018-12-19 21:53:58 "you obviously have not studied the history of the dish" i say as a slimy grilled onion bounces down my chest and onto my pants, staining every spot it hits with oil
1353 2018-12-19 21:53:50 The wall was never going to be built.  It’s was the grand empty promise from a political snake oil salesman.
1354 2018-12-19 21:53:45 WOW SEASONING DAW  add some sesame oil so that it’s like kbbq
1355 2018-12-19 21:53:45 Oh no. Senior Dog didn’t eat his breakfast. He’s been walking in circles. Just gave him 3000mg of fish oil and 25mg of prednisone. Hopefully it’ll help.
1356 2018-12-19 21:53:44 This is shocking! Please don’t let them win, keep up the good work. The charlatans and snake oil salesmen need to be shown up for what they are. The good will out.
1357 2018-12-19 21:53:41 ...This linseed oil for painting can be... $8... or I can get this mutli set with LOTS OF PAINTING THINGS... for $22..

1358 2018-12-19 21:53:13 The Keystone XL will emit less GHGs than the alternative - Oil being shipped into the Gulf of Mexico via tanker from Venezuela, Africa, and the Middle East.

1361 2018-12-19 21:53:07 Oil. Apparently old boilers didn’t have a separate immersion.
1362 2018-12-19 21:53:06 There is more to oil than just the oil moving down a pipeline. You make no sense.  Without that workhorse there is no work in Alberta in any other industry.
1363 2018-12-19 21:53:06 @amberkanwar Hi Amber, I would like to implore you to check some of the statements made by Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, in respect to TMX pipeline, "Countries outside N.A. want our Oil" Please identify these Countries. 48 of 50 Tankers filled by T.M. went to America! Thanks!
1364 2018-12-19 21:52:59 Ever since I saw the video of some insane people scooping out oil from the gutter  I can’t even eat out anymore!
1365 2018-12-19 21:52:58 no! the ground beef makes its own oil/grease as it cooks.
1366 2018-12-19 21:52:56 he is a critic of Putin then imprisoned. Guess who controls those oil wells now  that Khodorkovsky owned
1367 2018-12-19 21:52:49 I made some thieves oil. It is potent stuff.
1368 2018-12-19 21:52:34 You're leaving because there's no oil left to exploit.
1369 2018-12-19 21:52:30 I really wish Alberta would just disappear and take their dirty, toxic oil with them.  They give Canadians a bad name. Hell, they are not even nice.
1370 2018-12-19 21:52:27 Organic oil also has additional substances. In baby oil, just content is inside that'll do your body good. Since it's made for babies. So just good. The oil softens your skin. And the massage promotes blood circulation. Try three weeks with babyoil for $ 1.5 and massage
1371 2018-12-19 21:52:25 SA ,a country where projects that will benefit us for decades are considered as corruption, Imagine our own Nuclear Powerstation ie infinite supply of electricity no #loadshedding #eskom, The oil refinery that was blocked, imagine producing our own fuel ,lower prizes at the pump
1372 2018-12-19 21:52:11 This is going to sound sacrilegious, but I'm starting to hate Chelsea more than Woolwich. I'm not fond of the Scum at all, but... at least they try to play football the right way and they're not a blood & oil soaked money club. Easier to say that when we've won, tho.
1373 2018-12-19 21:52:09 I sure hope that these people are getting used to walking, when we cut off your oil & products associated it will become their normal situation. Wood for heat, you have lots there right? Good luck!
1374 2018-12-19 21:52:07 aku mau yang loreal extraordinary oil, thank you for the GA by the way
1375 2018-12-19 21:52:01 Pah I’m ill. Tonight is all about Olbas Oil, old school Vicks vaporub, Sudafed nasal spray, Lemsip Max capsules, Manuka honey, & A.Vogel Echinacea Forte!! . Oh, and ginger shots!!
1376 2018-12-19 21:52:00 In winter, instead of using harsh soaps that dry the skin, use shower gels, mild, fragrance-free, non-soap cleanser that moisturize the skin and hydrate it with creams, oil or lotions

1379 2018-12-19 21:51:49 @SpeakerRyan @GOP  Here's to the colo-rectal surgeon, He get you in the end!  Paulie will find a new grift. It's the GOP lifetime employment program.  Shilling for oil wells in Kenosha, Botox Breakfast Cereal promotion, NRA gun cozies.  Wonks r always treasured. #GOPTreason
1380 2018-12-19 21:51:32 Oh, you made this stir-fry with coconut oil? 
*locks eyes with her husband*

1381 2018-12-19 21:51:22 It’s Oilsands and the product is bitumen . They buy it cheap from  refine it then  export it for profit to foreign markets .
We on the other hand sell it to USA cheap and also import from other oil nations in the east .
1382 2018-12-19 21:51:20 Parents have started putting hemp oil on their salads. It’s reefer madness.
1383 2018-12-19 21:51:10 @realDonaldTrump Stock market just hit the lowest point in 2018. You appointed Powell, oil prices are too low cuz of you, your tariffs are screwing the economy & your foreign policy sucks, so who's too blame? YOU! Retirees are especially hurt by this. What a great president..NOT!
1384 2018-12-19 21:50:25 All oil paintings of Ophelia are pure magic. No other way around it.
1385 2018-12-19 21:50:23 Yes a demanding conversation with Xi.. this is the same China that will buy our oil if a pipeline is ever built.. Andy, this situation isn’t that simple, but your an idiot so just keep marching in your parade for that oil/ pipeline to send our product to foreign markets (China).
1386 2018-12-19 21:50:18 Never understood why jack daniels is popular in the 254. Thats probably one of the most trash whiskies in the world. It literally tastes like engine oil.
1387 2018-12-19 21:50:16 Really! Tbh my tin was from last year so I had thought....  I wonder if it's still as good a year on!  A 2 cost system over yellowed oil but if you say it good then not good maybe I'll stick to the BM Advance range 
1388 2018-12-19 21:50:10 I GOT AMBER OIL SO NOW MY ROOM SMELLS LIKE A CRYSTAL SHOP
1389 2018-12-19 21:50:09 I'm coming around to that view. They will try to burden us so we begin hobbled. Calculate what they stole over the decades from North Sea oil and deduct that from any share of UK debt they suggest we shoulder - might be pennies left!

1392 2018-12-19 21:49:56 Yes! I love the body oil and the facial oil! Also I’ve been moving the daily facial moisturizer. I’ve loved them all I’m going to try the serums next!
1393 2018-12-19 21:49:53 does anyone want any home made face balm i have accidentally made A Lot, you can use it for moisturising or for oil cleansing
1394 2018-12-19 21:49:45 Ok so u gotta stay away from stuffed drowned in oil like fried chicken n French fries, n not have a bunch of candy or mass of sweets like me XD

1397 2018-12-19 21:49:39 The report specifically says ‘oil and gas EXECUTIVES’.
1398 2018-12-19 21:49:36 auburn snake oil and rod bramblett overselling the poorly ran wrestling promotion auburn championship wrestling.
1399 2018-12-19 21:49:30 You forgot gas down to 2.50 a gal or lower in most states and we now export. Ore oil than we import which means oil independents
1400 2018-12-19 21:49:25 About Syria (1/2) 
1) US never had legal authority to be there 
2) Senate + Congress just said as much re Yemen 
3) US said a 2001 vote to FIGHT Al Qaeda in Afghanistan made it OK to aid + FUND Al Qaeda in Syria. What? 
4) This was always over a pipeline  + Saudi oil interests
1401 2018-12-19 21:49:25 Came to get an oil change I been here for 3 hours now lmao.
1402 2018-12-19 21:49:19 Yes people let's elect the conservatives back to power in Alberta and ignore their 40 year long robbery of the province's oil wealth that they covered up. They've changed. They have open neo-Nazis and homophobes now. #alberta #albertapolitics
1403 2018-12-19 21:49:12 i got all these coupons in my email to get an oil change and warner robins doesn’t even have a valvoline

1409 2018-12-19 21:48:59 Aaa. I don't have a good solution for the bathroom control problem, unfortunately, but if he seems to be in pain you can look into getting CBD oil pills for dogs??? I have a couple coworkers who give them to their elderly dogs and they say it makes a HUGE difference.
1410 2018-12-19 21:48:56 I love it when the dude doing my oil change lets me know I should “flush the engine.” I’ve had cars for about 25 years now and have never had to flush an engine. #NotToday #InNoMood
1411 2018-12-19 21:48:55 Took my car in for an oil change and now I need $300 worth of maintenance 
1412 2018-12-19 21:48:52 Are you on oil or gas?
1413 2018-12-19 21:48:52 Oil on canvas - Japan
1414 2018-12-19 21:48:41 I totally agree. But the problem actually extend beyond stock market. The UST 10Y is killing other asset class like crude oil.
1415 2018-12-19 21:48:39 Repping oil city, taadi 2000,  west side yooo!!!!
1416 2018-12-19 21:48:36 is adulthood being excited for a free oil change???
1417 2018-12-19 21:48:35 That’s weird. On most controls you can either have the two completely separate (eg on gas) or you can heat water without the radiators on (oil). Never seen it happen the other way round.
1418 2018-12-19 21:48:32 Peppermint oil
1419 2018-12-19 21:48:27 Powder River Basin has been the next big thing for a long time. Thought 2019 would be the year for big capex, but oil prices might not cooperate.
1420 2018-12-19 21:48:27 My father and many others in my family I just defended you from the Russians but now you can defend yourself and send your boys to get oil we are done
1421 2018-12-19 21:48:23 Okay

And the oil is a reference to Venezuela which nationalized it's oil and had healthcare but failed because it was corrupt and is a republican talking point against free healthcare
1422 2018-12-19 21:48:18 Got my CBD oil today. Took my first dose. Keep your fingers crossed. My hands were killing me today. Was archiving piles of patient charts at work.
1423 2018-12-19 21:48:09 Can someone change my oil? Idk how to do that so yea lol. Any I need it jih like yesterday. Please lol. I'll pay
1424 2018-12-19 21:48:05 What if Middle East fighting age males were enticed by Globalist open borders & free welfare policies so they leave defenseless their oil fields & land now ripe to build pipelines & seize wealth. Take out Libya, Syria, Iraq, destroy Israel, dominate SA. Trump changed everything!
1425 2018-12-19 21:47:59 #CrudeOil closed sharply lower as it extends the decline off October's high. If we extend this decline 46.00 is the next downside target.

1428 2018-12-19 21:47:52 Capital efficiency increasing may also mean well results are disappointing. Again, you can't paint a bullish picture with a guide like this. $FANG didn't disappoint as it's best in class. This is...
1429 2018-12-19 21:47:44 We want Big-Oil to fade away but every plastic bottle we drink from , all the plastics products are wrapped in come from oil. What can take the place of plastics.  Plastic is also adding so much to our problem with pollution.
1430 2018-12-19 21:47:34 The enemy is within  I'm very thankful for growing up and living in the greatest time ever, post WWII. More ppl lived better than any other time, but I think I've done all I can do to preserve it and forces determined to destroy it are just too entrenched
1431 2018-12-19 21:47:33 Owo adiye ni emi need....I have rice n oil already
1432 2018-12-19 21:47:33 When Turkey invades north eastern Syria, Assad will probably attack the southern oil fields to prevent the Turks from conquering that. Turkish or Assad regime secret police are both threats to people living in Syria and are not welcome.
1433 2018-12-19 21:47:24 4) That #Syria should join the Arab League again, or warming up between Russia & Saudi Arabia (in case of securing oil production) or sudden move  with regard to a "Peace Deal" in Yemen, etc are parts of preparation for this plan. Would this plan achieve some positive outcomes
1434 2018-12-19 21:47:17 Why do we sell our oil to the US for $11/barrel, and then turn around and buy oil from the Middle East for 5 times that.  Please tell me how that makes sense, and how it keeps our own people employed. Money that could be working right here, is leaving the country by the Billions
1435 2018-12-19 21:47:16 slide me@some coconut oil
1436 2018-12-19 21:47:15 Capital efficiency goes up means servicing cost skyrocketed.

Either scenario is terrible for the fundamentals of the business.
1437 2018-12-19 21:47:06 They can have the Middle East. Except for oil it’s nothing but trouble. And once electric vehicles catch on, the Middle East can count their fluid ounces and dream of a time that was
1438 2018-12-19 21:46:40 I downloaded your @gikibadges app earlier (suggested by @RSPOtweets), used it in Tesco and I'm super chuffed! I wasn't sure if @Lindt used sustainable palm oil, but now I'm 100% certain that they do!!  #christmasissaved

You definitely got a shot, just oil up that lovely dark skin and send some shots to a company
1440 2018-12-19 21:46:20 Oil is the #1 resource to make a country rich. We need a LEADER that will finally UNITE "ALL" Canadians and look out for the PROSPERITY of our country first & foremost. Then with the wealth we can INNOVATE & diversify to other forms of energy. #MadMax2019 #PPC2019 #LibConsOut

1443 2018-12-19 21:46:16 Before 7am in Cyprus the sea looks like a still, smooth layer of olive oil. Crystal clear, blue and quiet. Love the beach before the crowds. @MakronisosBeach @AyiaNapa2019
1444 2018-12-19 21:46:04 You’re the sweetest! So I’ve tried a couple different brands at Sally’s and Wella, Ion, and the one n only argan oil ones are my top picks. Although they started carrying arctic fox now which is one I’ve wanted to try but haven’t yet.
1445 2018-12-19 21:45:58 Going to be hard to find a "diversified, reliable funding stream" for #txed when Texas is so reliant on just two sources of tax revenue - the sales tax (volatile) and property tax (which is targeted for cuts). Oil/gas (also volatile) isn't enough. #txlege
1446 2018-12-19 21:45:43 
1447 2018-12-19 21:45:31 I know of two projects that Stephen hypocrite government invested 100s of millions. One is a rusting heap of metal tanks and towers the other is mostly underground foolishness.They tried to blow flame down hole to warm the ground. Morons.Why not SAGD? Stupid leader good 4 big oil
1448 2018-12-19 21:45:19 The difference is if a Pan Africanist makes a mistake ..he retracts and corrects..as seen with Au oil dollar Esap ,Zimasset ,etc ... Political opportunists will keep telling u the Bond is 1:1 us even if they themselves don't accept it
1449 2018-12-19 21:45:15 For years I've done rice salad or tabouleh at buffets. Vvv popular with everyone- but make sure put lots of freshly chopped herbs- mint, coriander, parsley& basil. Rice salad- any salad veg, with oil& vinegar as well as fresh herbs. Tabouleh- cuc, toms,herbs,lemon juice,oil
1450 2018-12-19 21:45:15 I'm asking a practical structural question about how secession would work. Canada benefits from Alberta oil and Alberta oil doesn't get to market without the other provinces. It's a geographical problem for you. Mintz's existential argument is useless.
1451 2018-12-19 21:45:14 That foundation is IT.  An oil primer and it moves and lays like butter!
1452 2018-12-19 21:45:13 Why is it a major blunder to allow the Syrians to govern their own country Obama created this mess by funding the terrorists with weapons through Benghazi. McStain funded ISIS along with France Israel and the UK so you could control their oil. Leave them alone.
1453 2018-12-19 21:45:13 Save your money and just buy baby oil ,which you massage in 
1454 2018-12-19 21:45:05 We burn the midnight oil in order to beat our clients expectations
1455 2018-12-19 21:45:00 She put SHOUT in Kiana’s body oil.
1456 2018-12-19 21:44:55 The problem is timing.  Isn’t this more or less handing the country over to Putin? And, what about the Kurds who have fought valiantly and bravely against Assad and Russian fighters? Aren’t we just abandoning them to be finished off? Oil is a factor, to Russia, here.
1457 2018-12-19 21:44:54 If her oil and tire pressure light on she not gone take you serious
1458 2018-12-19 21:44:48 I'm bringing up oil and gas to point out the problem in telling me (not asking me) to give up FB, but being OK with oil and gas, which kills people and funds the GOP
1459 2018-12-19 21:44:41 What if Middle East fighting age males were enticed by Globalist open borders & free welfare policies so they leave defenseless their oil fields & land now ripe to build pipelines & seize wealth. Take out Libya, Syria, Iraq, destroy Israel, dominate SA. Trump changed everything!
1460 2018-12-19 21:44:26 Nothings every that simple ha. Although last NED appointment in the summer would back this theory. Why would you add someone to Legal when main aim is proposed to developing oil assets? #GKP
1461 2018-12-19 21:44:17 Hey @DevinDVote didn't the last guy you recommend say something about oil prices recently.  Like how great it is they are low and how he hopes OPEC will keep it that way?

1463 2018-12-19 21:44:03 Looks like oil.
1464 2018-12-19 21:43:57 Your head get oil..  See y u are my crush
1465 2018-12-19 21:43:53 I’m glad you distinguished between ignorance and stupidity. I’ll tell you from over here the impression being given is that for years under Klein AB lived fat off oil and didn’t have provincial taxes and the conservatives did nothing to diversify their industries. Now they pay.
1466 2018-12-19 21:43:47 He refuses to tax Wall Street and is heavily, like 2nd to Cruz heavy, in bed with the oil industry.

Only if he's the last Dem standing ...
1467 2018-12-19 21:43:46 That might be low - do you get closer to ~40-45% using $20-25/Mboe/d?

1469 2018-12-19 21:43:44 From what I heard, China gets their oil from Russia and Iran cheap...  but to be honest... environmental impact is formost. Let’s be real... my children will have a clean Earth to inherit one day...

1471 2018-12-19 21:43:35 I need to get an oil change ASAP 
1472 2018-12-19 21:43:34 i need to buy tea tree oil
1473 2018-12-19 21:43:32 Selling to foreigners for exchange? Do you mean at a 40% discount to the US? You do know that the earth uses more oil every day, including Canada? We may leave it behind, but it won't be in your lifetime. Please learn more about the economics of Can oil.
1474 2018-12-19 21:43:27 I'd be ok if Canada banned all Saudi oil imports in response to their economic attacks on Canada. The only real impact such a ban would have is on the Irving refinery in New Brunswick, which can instead, refine Newfoundland oil instead of NL's oil going to the US for refinement.

1479 2018-12-19 21:43:05 Hotdesking sounds pretty bad, but one of my best friends was "hotbedding" when he was working oil fields back in 2013/14. Made over $200k that year. Literally shared a bed with another guy who worked opposite shifts.

1490 2018-12-19 21:41:53 We do have a lot of shale/tight oil here.  A lot at better or similar economics.  Transportation and regulatory risk over the last few years has really hurt our ability to attract investment.

1500 2018-12-19 21:41:25 At the beginning of Trump’s term, the US had 3 cards to play to influence the Syria endgame:
—Aid to the opposition
—Conditional reconstruction assistance 
—Troops & allies controlling 1/3 of the country & key oil/gas resources

Trump has now given them all away for...nothing.

1504 2018-12-19 21:41:17 We export far more oil than we import.  To stop imports, Irving in NB needs to refine Newfoundland oil instead of Saudi oil. 
Canadian crude oil facts:
Canadian production is 4.2 MMb/d
We import 0.8 MMb/d
We exports 3.3 MMb/d
Crude oil shipped to domestic refineries: 1.8 MMb/d

1507 2018-12-19 21:41:01 One down, two to go.  End the wars.  A waste of time and $$$. This conflict was about the Saudi's desire to build a pipeline through Syria to supply Europe with oil. Why fight their battles?  Won't hear that on MSM.  Shouldn't have been there in the 1st place. #OccupyPeace
1508 2018-12-19 21:40:57 How would they make money thru the downfall of Canadian o&g? Don’t americans already produce oil and gas cheaper than the tar sands can, with or without a pipeline?

1542 2018-12-19 21:37:57 It’s a matter of honor which Trump does not understand. #SDF spilled blood for US interests in Syria. It’s a matter of wealth. A honest to goodness pro-US region in oil rich Syria is good for US economically. It is also an exceptional area for bases. Why leave them to die?

1553 2018-12-19 21:36:07 This probably just marked the bottom.  Peter went long oil at $75 on the breakout and it was a manipulated false breakout that ensued with a massive sell off to $45 two months later.  This drop looks like a bear trap in oil.

1558 2018-12-19 21:35:43 Trump’s “Russian agenda” must be to help out the Russian gas, oil industry right? It is about the only profitable thing in a Russian economy ranked about 13th in the world.Oops!Trump must be blocking Putin’s messages as the USA is now the biggest oil producer in world. Russiahoax
1559 2018-12-19 21:35:42 It seems everywhere I look, there's Turkey. Wanting us to pull out of Syria so they can exterminate the Kurds. And Putin gets a port for his Rosneft Oil. And  gets a tower in Moscow. And if  screws this up,  and his family will have to answer to the Russian Mob.
1560 2018-12-19 21:35:37 are motivated by oil. Trump is tied to Saudi Arabia because of his family's personal business but the GOP and some Democrats are tied to them because of the oil.

   Have not enough of them died for your love of cheap free oil and your love of carnage just to bank a quick buck.

1602 2018-12-19 21:31:13 Why would #Russia declare victory? At first, #Obama's #DOD, which it still is, denied presence in #Syria. Then US, directed by #McCain, helped ISIS. Now #Pentagon implies it is there to contain Russia. That would explain #US's #Ukraine policy!

NB #Golan and oil!

#MIC
1603 2018-12-19 21:31:10 Many people can greatly minimize use of oil and gas. Why are so aggressive in going after me about FB but defending oil and gas? Hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, transit funding over highway expansion, land use planning and more.  And how do you know how others use FB?
1604 2018-12-19 21:31:06 I find it funny that everyone is crying for help for the oil industry but the industry was forced to cut production to reduce the inventory. Any other industry would reduce supply to increase demand.
1605 2018-12-19 21:31:01 What good is finding new markets if WE CANT GET OUR OIL TO MARKET in the first place.

Oil is way down so I’ll cut him a bit of slack. But not much

When I saw us enter 2p with $AAPL well off 168 area..then saw the raise - knew it was trouble

1612 2018-12-19 21:30:27 Oil and gas industry is booming in the US but is flat in Canada. I blame it mostly on government over-regulation and anti O&G sentiment , besides our limited ability to move it to market efficiently.

1615 2018-12-19 21:30:14 That’s good, I was just put back a bit but on how two tankers, I think it was, made it to Asia, the rest went to America. Would be good to see more to Asia, but with Iran right there. Closer, cheaper oil... why get it from Canada?

1619 2018-12-19 21:30:00 Despite low oil prices & lack of market access, Alberta’s economic growth is still strong relative to other Canadian provinces. Read more here! @AB_EDT @atbfinancial @CalgaryChamber #Alberta #Economy #FutureEconomyCanada
1620 2018-12-19 21:29:59 I think most people in Canada have been asking for years. Why are we not using our own oil instead of paying world prices.
1621 2018-12-19 21:29:52 I read a doc that encouraged partnerships with FNs, primarily as an exercise in creating general social acceptance for dirty oil projects.
1622 2018-12-19 21:29:42 1. You’re underestimating how much I dislike oil companies. 2. The fact that avoiding something is difficult is not a reason not to do it. 3. As @goodlittletiger points out, it’s more difficult to avoid any interactions with oil companies than FB (doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try).
1623 2018-12-19 21:29:26 Not our fight Get out of all the Mid East. War for oil ends with our POTUS
1624 2018-12-19 21:29:24 maybe if it's sustained it will be covered more widely. For now, the rest of the country fully knows Albertans are upset about how the oil & gas industries are being exchanged for greener resources.
1625 2018-12-19 21:29:21 There is a very big Oil refinery in Kaduna that was productive and also Kaduna Petroleum College to become operational soon yet there is no OIL in Kaduna. We need to see Nigeria as ONE to progress

1634 2018-12-19 21:28:27 @BBC3CR We use fry light on everything that needs an oil to cook. Slimming world swear by it.
1635 2018-12-19 21:28:18 like oil in these rough waters
1636 2018-12-19 21:27:58 Taking back 3 if the special tax exemption points more than make up for the drop in price. We were taxing oil at 1% GPT for the majority of production which killed our state budget.
1637 2018-12-19 21:27:50 Fuck what Republicans say pulling out of Syria is the right thing to do. Bring back our children that are out there for energy oil and etc. Why should they die for oil when we here have tech that can make us independent from oil.
1638 2018-12-19 21:27:50 I believe it’s more nefarious than just that . That’s the intent but someone or group in the USA is making a lot of money off of the downfall of oil and gas . The funding and marketing is about the environment but under the surface it’s about money
1639 2018-12-19 21:27:49 Olive oil is high in monounsaturated fat, which is healthy for you.
1640 2018-12-19 21:27:32 bless that my oil change was just an oil change and not brake stuff too like i was afraid it would be
1641 2018-12-19 21:27:30 Lagos state, we're naturally ahead, the only state that have a new governor before election, we're just too much, na handover we dey wait for.

1643 2018-12-19 21:27:13 Same media knows that slaughter of our people in Mpembeni near Esikhawini in KZN is fuelled by oil and gas which Motsepes and INgonyama Trust seek to quench their thirst for supper profits at the expense of the country and her people
1644 2018-12-19 21:27:12 Jerome Powell Federal Reserve Chairman is a know nothing moronic clown. President Trump, fire this clown.  Put woman with brains Janet Yellen back in charge. Powell obviously has no clue on interest rates. @realDonaldTrump @cnbc @carlquintanilla
1645 2018-12-19 21:27:11 Today I got a big girl job offer AND got my oil changed. I might be going by Allison soon at this rate...scary stuff.
1646 2018-12-19 21:26:56 Do you have oil well?
1647 2018-12-19 21:26:54 Lyle surely you can understand that electricity generated by solar wind geothermal and hydro is the same as electricity generated by coal oil and gas? Yes?

1649 2018-12-19 21:26:47 It's a good gift..It's their land, Why do our troops have to die protecting oil and Israel when we claim we have the biggest oil reserves in the world...If corporations want that oil let them pay Private militaries or let the Israelis put their Asses on the line for a change
1650 2018-12-19 21:26:44 I loved him when he ran. Met him. Chatted. But recently it's been published that he's taken several large sum donations from the oil and gas industry. It really bummed me out. :(
1651 2018-12-19 21:26:41 Flynn-planned oil empire blocked by pesky sanctions?
Kidnapping for Erdogan sometimes comes up. Treason?

I like Judge Sullivan.  A lot.

1653 2018-12-19 21:26:26 The economy is doing great, so the FED drives it lower to raise rates? Oil at $47 not good enough? Look at 2 yrs ago, where were we then? Aggrevated enough yet? Yes we are!
1654 2018-12-19 21:26:26 Putin Oil. Oil Putin. The reason Putin was there in the first place. Putin is pulling the short hairs hard.

1658 2018-12-19 21:26:14 Big oil $$$
Never once did any of these people express to me home much were they going to receive. How about the schools?
Yet I suddenly most of the people insulting constantly were men. Men working for a government entity.
Maybe they just do not understand that women should be
1659 2018-12-19 21:26:13 When you say 'that's what WE have unleashed' I trust you refer the Tory party. Sorry to be blunt but If you get into bed with bigots and snake oil salesmen what do you expect.

1661 2018-12-19 21:26:07 They need to think about whether their oil would be any less landlocked were they to become a country. Their best chance of getting their oil out of Alberta is through Canada (if they can find some patience). That wouldn't improve if they left Canada.
1662 2018-12-19 21:26:03 Wisdom will not kill you sir, you deserve a presidential appointment
1663 2018-12-19 21:26:02 Can we talk about how disgusting CBD oil tastes now?
1664 2018-12-19 21:25:59 To much truffle oil my misses told me... but she liked the lamb scratching . 

Not a bad evening meal, but a rollicking for not being more healthy..
1665 2018-12-19 21:25:53 Better oil your cogs if you want to resonate, though it is pretty murky where the remoaners hang out. Comes from all that slime & greased palms

1667 2018-12-19 21:25:44 Day 5 of our 5 day vacation & my wife is dragging me 2 get an oil change! 
1668 2018-12-19 21:25:40 You are so right.  Alberta should not be able to have any convoys because those oil and gas workers should be working & bringing in lots of money for the governments.
1669 2018-12-19 21:25:38 Before stating opinions & conclusions with science we disclose who funding & vested interests.  
Data indicates the level of emissions from oil sands is higher than other sources, that its economic when subsidized directly, given tax/royalty breaks, pollution isn't costed in
1670 2018-12-19 21:25:37 Sound like you bout to go get a oil change or sum 
1671 2018-12-19 21:25:29 Again?

1674 2018-12-19 21:25:18 Oil spots can be removed from clothing with Talcum Powder.
1675 2018-12-19 21:25:06 They don’t want the bailout, just a way to move their oil. They neaver asked for a bailout.
1676 2018-12-19 21:24:53 Let’s not forget that because of groups like west coast law our economy is losing out on $80 million dollars a day in lost revenues. Take a look at who is benefiting from the oil differential and you will see who is funding groups like WCL.
1677 2018-12-19 21:24:52 I'll repeat myself. Why don't we build our own refineries? Why is our oil controlled by 
outside interests?
     Why?
1678 2018-12-19 21:24:43 Why would you buy a used vehicle instead of a brand new one?  Also, paying roughly $150 for an average oil change on a BMW vs. $50 on an average Toyota...gimme the new Toyota!  Also...some Lexus parts are interchangeable with Toyota if you desire luxury
1679 2018-12-19 21:24:32 I bought this Indica oil for my pen. Imma open the shit up and line a blunt with it 
1680 2018-12-19 21:24:24 Elsie herself said that "Independence transcends oil/ the economy/ education/ (insert to taste)". What more could the brainless masses want or need to see?

1682 2018-12-19 21:23:53 $SPX $QQQ $IWM in the most vicious downtrend since 2011. All down over 10% over the last 2 weeks and down more than 15% from their highs. Trade war, rising rates, slowing economic growth, corporate scandals $FB $JNJ, oil crash all contributing to fear and lack of confidence.
1683 2018-12-19 21:23:53 It would be interesting to see this vs CFR Saudi Barley values. Generally, when oil prices are high they can provide more subsidies. Last time of was this low on crude, CFR values were also super cheap. Not so today.
1684 2018-12-19 21:23:49 In wanting to look exclusively at a player's on-field achievements, I think it's important to examine what kind of precent that sets. Letting Schilling in demonstrates to people violently marginalized by him that his kind of rhetoric is acceptable so long as he plays well.
1685 2018-12-19 21:23:46 Some chats are a turn off
1686 2018-12-19 21:23:42 Ye, the vast majority of those in Westminster never wants to hear from the Scottish representatives or hear anything about Scotland on less it involves Scottish oil. Then, they sit up and take notice.
1687 2018-12-19 21:23:40 Exactly what I am saying you couldn't convince a serious agro-business man in Nigeria to sell say to Sengal because they don't lack in Yam. The problem of exporting food from Nigeria to world let alone other parts of Africa is primarily our fault because we let oil rule our mind
1688 2018-12-19 21:23:39 “...Despite endless promises from so many self-appointed prophets of a renewable future, demand for oil continues to rise since it is needed for petro-chemicals...”
 @jackmintz
1689 2018-12-19 21:23:30 I don’t know which is more disheartening - knowing a liar, snake oil salesman like you is “president”, or knowing some Americans were actually gullible enough to vote for you.
1690 2018-12-19 21:23:21 Wawu! Bro how was ur day?
1691 2018-12-19 21:23:18 That's just reminded me I need to buy some more snake oil #selfserving
1692 2018-12-19 21:23:14 Don’t confuse development with consumption...  we’ve never claimed to be the most responsible consumers of oil and gas.
1693 2018-12-19 21:23:13 Your right. Every country needs to do their part.  Canada needs to be a leader.  That why its important that canadian Oil And gas leads the way.
1694 2018-12-19 21:23:12 EZ shares +0.4%, but US shares -1.5% (Nasdaq -2.1%) as Fed not dovish enough for mkts & Powell dismissed recent mkt falls as “a little bit of volatility”.

1697 2018-12-19 21:22:48 Let’s get rid of oil altogether & move to the 21st century. Hard to believe there are people still pushing this. 20th century people I guess.
1698 2018-12-19 21:22:41 only commodity that is up is oil and that is just a bounce from yesterdays fall. stocks, gold, etc falling like rain.   I just hung up with Dennis and catching up with him tomorrow at lunch.  will tell him he needs to move into BC.
1699 2018-12-19 21:22:36 I’m getting my oil changed and I am starving. And of course they just got the wrong filter for my car. I can’t.  I’m so mad.
1700 2018-12-19 21:22:34 Longshoremen unloading oil tankers and contractors.
1701 2018-12-19 21:22:28 We would be starting a world war by invading another country and taking over to control oil. Russia would want it, China would want it. This would cause huge upset around the world and make the US a target and it’s smarter than that. Believe fake news all you want.

1709 2018-12-19 21:20:51 Agree, and your right we r the master of our own problem,USA buys our cheap oil and sells it for high prices,we should have had east west pipelines 20 years ago,but we had good relationships with USA until trump & idiot boy but heads &they also guilty of flooding the market
1710 2018-12-19 21:20:45 I’ve heard people pronounce it as a dactyl — OLLive oil.
1711 2018-12-19 21:20:43 Trump treasury gave 8 exemptions for Iranian oil. Hmmm...at Russia's behest?
1712 2018-12-19 21:20:42 Oil changed, car driving so much lighter, full tank got my wine and my food now it's time to be lame.

1714 2018-12-19 21:20:34 I look forward to hearing you announce that you demanded Irving Oil support Canadian oil from Newfoundland and stop importing Saudi oil.  It's crazy that Newfoundland has to send their oil out to US refineries.  Newfoundland produces enough oil to supply all 4 Atlantic provinces.
1715 2018-12-19 21:20:31 I'll play your game. Where does Quebec get its Oil from?

1717 2018-12-19 21:20:24 Maybe it’s a film of oil from the coffee beans.  I went out to eat a few months ago and had to film my salad dressing because the oil layer on top was iridescent and would have been a cute highlight
1718 2018-12-19 21:20:21 Movie Quotes: "Friendship and money: oil and water". Al Pacino (The Godfather)
1719 2018-12-19 21:20:16 “Study how the US operates” The US has no need for oil reservoir since we produce 70% of our own oil. After that we have plenty in reserves and OPEC the leading producer and seller of oil in Middle East begs the US to buy from them even when we don’t need it to help.
1720 2018-12-19 21:20:14 I stink because i used old motor oil to quench in today. Pretty sure it worked. Now if i only knew what i was doing on this twitter machine.

1722 2018-12-19 21:20:00 I see lots of recipes calling for searing first and then putting flavoring (garlic, oil, etc.) into the sous vide bag to cook. Any thoughts on which order is usually best? Or is it specific to the dish?

1729 2018-12-19 21:19:30 Get your facts straight before tweeting. 
1. Gas prices were the highest under GW Bush. Obama managed to lower then as part of the Iran deal.
2. Gas prices would be even lower if the Iran deal wasn't cancelled because Iranian oil would preclude Russia and SA from lowering supply

1733 2018-12-19 21:19:05 That's only because it's not in back alley ways, brokered sex parties, dark corners!  Because that's what Russia, and the oil consortium wanted {in your face disruption}!  Break the bank America, own the world coming apart at the seams governance!  Sanction freedom

1735 2018-12-19 21:18:54 I do feel sympathy for oil patch workers who suffer in downturns, however you chose to employ yourself in a dying industry. And your suffering doesn't outweigh the suffering of our planet and the 6 billion people who live here.
1736 2018-12-19 21:18:53 .... and guess what Trevor? @HillaryClinton and the @DNC paid for Steele's dossier, to start LIES about the @POTUS. BUT that was all OK for the two-faced democrat Party Politics bunch of liars. BUT just let a Republican do all that Hillary did, and they would deep fried in oil.
1737 2018-12-19 21:18:35 Its about oil and also not creating an even worse vacuum.

1759 2018-12-19 21:16:39 no not at all. It'd be like brands promoting "ingredients come and go, but palm oil is here to stay" and using an Orangutan as the mascot  it's poor taste. You can't use the animal you exploit to promote your brand, it's fucking backwards.

1767 2018-12-19 21:15:21 There's nothing wrong with cheap oil, it's when governments interfere in the market as they are doing in Canada that causes problems. The US is now energy independent; Canada should become independent so we wouldn't have to import from bad regimes like Saudi Arabia.
1768 2018-12-19 21:15:20 Coconut oil smells so musty I don’t understand why people love it so much
1769 2018-12-19 21:15:08 and I would agree, but in the exact opposite direction

tech out-lobbies oil now, and given systematic biases against poor people participating in government, a "younger, tech-savvier" congress in the medium term will just end up stacked with mid-level tech execs
1770 2018-12-19 21:15:04 Yep, because oil and gas is more important that anything else with the cons.  Likely because of that nice big lobby money. Healthcare? Cut. Education? Cut. Human rights? Fuckem. Oil? *drops pants*

1788 2018-12-19 21:13:35 The only way to win in the Middle East is to completely wipe it off the map. They've been fighting for hundreds of years. We should pull out drill our own oil in America for Americans and forgot about over there. Help Israel if they run into anything they can't handle. That's it.
1789 2018-12-19 21:13:35 I said all I just wanted an oil change and an air filter change.

1813 2018-12-19 21:11:24 Lol solid resource. Sorry but I don’t believe an article without a .edu/.gov at the end of it. Not one part in that entire article does it refer to Operation Restore Hope to gain control of oil. Article also mentions exploration of oil started in mid 2000s. Discovery was in 1945.
1814 2018-12-19 21:11:11 Should do. Incredibly painful - the trapped gas they put in irritates the diaphragm. Peppermint oil/tea can help
1815 2018-12-19 21:11:10 Lmao do you seriously think Turkey will leave Northern Syria to Assad when they're done? Once Turkey controls it, the Syrian government can say goodbye to all the oil up there. How anyone can think that Syria is winning in this situation is beyond me.

1819 2018-12-19 21:10:23 Expensive beauty products don't just fail to work, they harm your skin. I used to spend hundreds of dollars on face creams, and my face was dry in some areas and oily in others. Now I just use inexpensive jojoba oil, and my skin has never looked better.
1820 2018-12-19 21:10:22 I would like to congratulate the entire population of the United States. With an increase in shale oil production, irreversible processes will begin to occur. During deep explosions, soils will begin to move, which will affect several of the most famous volcanoes.
1821 2018-12-19 21:10:21 Alberta wants a pipeline with 3x the capacity. They want to increase production, and it's among the dirtiest sources of oil in the world. We can't meet our targets if AB doesn't take part. And jobs today is not a good enough reason; it's self-defeating.

1831 2018-12-19 21:09:12 They charged me way too much for an oil change and I never went back. Plus they called and mailed me a letter trying to get me to sell my car to them
1832 2018-12-19 21:09:01 Please!  Bolton needs as many troops as he can for when they announce they're invading Venezuela.

1836 2018-12-19 21:08:16 For me the $60 per barrel benchmark is too high ,what if Venezuela just play around with the price of crude oil ????.
Secondly the 2.3 million barrel per day exportation rate doesn't seem achievable for me..
1837 2018-12-19 21:08:15 There is currently an oil glut as well. There will never be any reasonable need for fracking even if it was an improved process...
1838 2018-12-19 21:08:13 watching twitter videos while my oil gets changed... couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t hear my fucking video.. this shit was playing in my car in the shop and yeah so story of my life.

1851 2018-12-19 21:06:55 Meh. Conducting war for oil and dope is dangerous stuff. I suppose after Sinatra ripped off/killed my grandfather f*cking up OXCART taking off world mineral extraction off the table in December '63, there wasn't much else.
1852 2018-12-19 21:06:55 NOT the job of the FED to get into a "PISSING CONTEST" with the President! There is literally NO discernible inflation to be seen in this economy...Wages Stable...Oil under 50/Barrel...Gold/Copper/Silver in the TOILET! @wsj @LPNational @FoxBusiness @CNBC @cvpayne @barronsonline
1853 2018-12-19 21:06:53 Me after I accidentally put 4 extra drops of essential oil in the diffuser: Oh boy it’s about to get   M I N T Y. F R E S H. 
1854 2018-12-19 21:06:45 I have a 1971 Datsun 510. Not American muscle, by any means, but a car I've had for 15 years. I've turned every bolt in the car and swapped engines 4 times, trying to settle in on what I want. No family history, though - my dad couldn't change oil.

1856 2018-12-19 21:06:19 A socialist believes in Sharing resources among all.  Communism is government legislated control of resources (oil as an example) and sharing those resources with have nots (Quebec as an example)

1858 2018-12-19 21:06:12 Oil changes  once a year now or8ooo cool
1859 2018-12-19 21:05:57 all I asked for christmas this year was an essential oil diffuser & a basket to put my throw blankets in. i’m officially 67 years old.
1860 2018-12-19 21:05:55 My new car is a lot more modernized than my last one and literally tells you anything and everything it needs. I just got an oil change and it cost $100 compared to $30 for my last car. At least it only needs to be done once a year compared to 3 times a year.
1861 2018-12-19 21:05:55 If I didn't already graduate high school, this would have been my senior quote: "Any time that is not spent wiping oil off of a baby seal is wasted time." Thanks for this gem, @markellislive.

1864 2018-12-19 21:05:43 Great progress Bill in dividing the country, taking money from productive provinces and giving to the welfare system of QC, 100s of billions CAD of oil and gas stock value has evaporated. The retired’s savings, pension plans, you should be proud!!
1865 2018-12-19 21:05:42 So, stock was up 80 to 100 points when I got home today, with several hours left...then the FED raises rates and it plumets 350+ pts...and oil is less than $41 a barrel. 4th hike in year....way to work on killing start of economy for new year. Get rid of the FED....corrupt
1866 2018-12-19 21:05:22 A drizzle of olive oil would of done it boo
1867 2018-12-19 21:04:53 Is it nessecary for the men who work at car washes to always hit on you when you just trying to get a damn oil change!? Fuck off bruh. Unless you paying for this synthetic oil change bc my dumbass got a VW
1868 2018-12-19 21:04:53 Only for those who have become zombies for Alberta corporate oil interests.

1873 2018-12-19 21:03:51 Too much to unpack here in just one or two tweets. Bottom line is Kurds can join Damascus. Some already have. The US is an illegal invading occupation force that has been stealing Syria's oil. If we want sovereignty, we need to start respecting other countries' sovereignty.
1874 2018-12-19 21:03:37 When I was young I remember my mother didn’t buy chocolates for us because that ingredients including the pig  oil and also the jelly candy I see in the mall they made of pig skin..last year i watch  also the documentary about how to make jelly candy they made from pig skin

1879 2018-12-19 21:02:26 Then don’t complain, who else works on the oil fields besides tradespeople?
1880 2018-12-19 21:02:26 Olive oil produces a fluffier texture. Butter tastes divine. Mix them together. Magic!
1881 2018-12-19 21:02:19 that by presenting arguments in favor of Alberta separation, to make it seem doable, he increases the leverage of Alberta, and by extension, the Alberta oil industry.
1882 2018-12-19 21:02:17 Thank you @theCAODC for standing up for the families in the Oil&Gas industry.
1883 2018-12-19 21:01:59 Ahh I think their Cannatonic strain will be available in cartridges and tinctures. Smoking MCT oil releases harmful compounds such as Formaldehyde, Acetaldehyde, and Acrolein!
1884 2018-12-19 21:01:55 This government didn’t screw them. The previous Alberta government screwed them.  How often has the oil downturn happened in Alberta. You would think Albertans would be prepared.
1885 2018-12-19 21:01:53 Its arguable. If you want to be extreme even avocados and palm oil is bad. I chose to not eat a living thing that HAS feelings and feels pain.

1887 2018-12-19 21:01:48 Tell me why Indigenous groups don’t protest all the sewage being pumped into waterways.   BC & Que are 2 of biggest perpetrators.  I would suggest for most part they don’t see how to get $ from sewage, where as Oil a different opportunity.
1888 2018-12-19 21:01:47 @Tesco would you consider having a palm oil free/sustainable isle in every store? Would be easier for customers #palmoilfree #PalmOil

1891 2018-12-19 21:01:38 I got to this dealership at 12:45. I just needed an oil change.  ITS FUCKING 3PM WHY AM I STILL HERE?!
1892 2018-12-19 21:01:34 That's like oil and water... may as well call it the until fallrate plays monopoly stream lol
1893 2018-12-19 21:01:30 Need East and West Pipelines built, then use that money to protect canadian interests. Hope this is resolved quickly Imagine a booming oil and energy sector , from green techology and oil pipelines, all canadian companies will prosper we cant have any more delays on this topic
1894 2018-12-19 21:01:25 To belabor the metaphor.
data breaches are oil spills
information smog is algae blooms
privacy is an endangered animal
widespread loss of trust & agency is climate change?

Hard to close that last loop.
1895 2018-12-19 21:01:08 It gotta be 50/50 I’m not cooking every meal, fixing a tire and changing the oil not even hard, plumbing a different story 
1896 2018-12-19 21:01:03 The future is now with the oil importers, EU, Japan, Turkey (EU CU), India and China(ish). India, Turkey and China all grew despite importing oil (but China has lots). They will boom now. Turkey is EU. India and China will not give us a better deal outside the EU. Already failed

1915 2018-12-19 20:59:23 So then how can they say they prefer Alberta oil?
1916 2018-12-19 20:59:05 We all know what oil workers want.  This only puts unnecessary carbon in the air.
1917 2018-12-19 20:59:00 Why is a woman cooking an at least? Then when I say men need to know how change the tires, fix the plumbing and change the oil I’m out of line lol wild
1918 2018-12-19 20:59:00 Perhaps some way to guarantee that your oil is unadulterated? Start a mark for "Unadulterated Olive Oil". "Provably unadulterated unlike the rest!". If knew the oil was pure, I would buy it regardless of brand, and I don't trusts brands much anyway.

1921 2018-12-19 20:58:56 The pipeline already exists. They are pretending the whole country’s future rests on one pipeline expansion.

Oil corporations that were smart enough to invest in their own rail and infrastructure are able to get to the market. The ones that didn’t are stuck in the backlog
1922 2018-12-19 20:58:52 Ok. UK can finish what is left for their oil pipelines.
1923 2018-12-19 20:58:46 There is merit to staying out of other countries travails but electricity, transportation for people and food, hospitals, govmnts,etc etc. Modern civilzation still needs oil and high prices bring real woe.just my opinion,thanks .

1931 2018-12-19 20:58:10 Not that I'm aware of. Wonder if this could trigger low oil discounts?
1932 2018-12-19 20:57:59 The Redwood-Davis case is built on the oil price rise from 2007-2014. Importers like the EU and Japan stalled. Oil producers grew rapidly. Even then, umpteen times almost nothing is still almost nothing. You are an armchair theorist easily misled because you want to be

1945 2018-12-19 20:56:46 The whole system required continued enforcement of keeping USD as reserve currency and monopoly oil currency. I think this is a bad tradeoff, along with requirement of giving away manufacturing capacity and jobs to China so they could fund our deficits. Loser was middle America
1946 2018-12-19 20:56:45 QC has moratorium on Frac, but they sure don’t have one for useage. QC loves their blood oil. O&G responsible use of water is of no more concern than the environmental catastrophe that is raw sewage dumping in QC. Let’s see that heavy price for pollution paid by QC.
1947 2018-12-19 20:56:43 It’s a fake crisis. This is about ONE pipeline expansion. It’s Cons blaming NDP, Libs, or Greens for bad business decisions by some private oil corporations.

There is too much oil and AB tar sands oil is poor quality. No proof this expansion would change price per barrel

Very lucky he got those through!
1950 2018-12-19 20:56:18 Canadas infrastructure support? What would that be? No oil to East coast. None to Northern BC, and trains to BC lower mainland. Thanks for as little as humanly  possible
1951 2018-12-19 20:56:05 don't thing price cures price in this case. you can find a bottom but no one will buy enthusiastically cuz there's nothing good to look up to: same situation in oil.
1952 2018-12-19 20:56:01 Back in the 70ts when I lived there I heard that same nonsense, it was just as ridiculous then as it is mow, AB can't survive on its own, since oil is the major resource how would they market it if they can't do now when they are supported by the rest of the country.

1961 2018-12-19 20:55:14 Why does @jamieoliver  drench everything in olive oil? #jamiesquickandeasychristmas
1962 2018-12-19 20:55:08 Some of the largest users of oil are large companies and corporations, most people will not feel the burn unless you drive for a living. This 50% increase has been absolutely blown out of proportion.

1977 2018-12-19 20:54:15 One of these days, we're gonna find out all the tech companies let Russians run wild all over them to distract from something significantly worse. I dunno. Shooting all the remaining elephants? Making orphans into oil? Bringing back Korn? All possible.
1978 2018-12-19 20:53:46 Any system that removes the incentive to do a job that isn’t desireable is destined to fail. Who would work on, for example, an oil rig miles from family for months on end without any financial incentive? Especially when you could get the same life by working in a nearby office.
1979 2018-12-19 20:53:37 And we go vaccinate ourselves against that one again....

#WeAllDeserveToBeSafe
1980 2018-12-19 20:53:36 Sarcastic maybe. 
That pack of malt and oil has taken almost 2k.
1981 2018-12-19 20:53:30 Tell me is it oil painting or watercolour painting ? Thanks.
1982 2018-12-19 20:53:28 Ya you are. That 22km convoy of trucks he is grinning about, he wants to add them to the unemployment line as well. Pipeline = cheaper transport of oil for his oil buddies and higher unemployment for the transportarion industry.
1983 2018-12-19 20:53:27 #OIL #OOTT #WT
#EIA report showed a draw of 500,000 barrels only but the market reacted positively. That said, the rally appeared unsustainable.
1984 2018-12-19 20:53:13 When King Saul died, even David mourned the more. 

Painful, for him, that Saul died like a man w/out the oil. 

A fmr Chief of Defense hunted down like a chicken. 

And you want to judge him as deserving to lose his life? 

Never will that sell, to me...
1985 2018-12-19 20:53:11 Me: Do you use beard oil?

Barber: Nah, I eat pussy!
1986 2018-12-19 20:53:11 Ok then, why can't we refine our oil in Alberta or wherever we find it? Why don't we use our own oil instead of sending it to other countries? Why do people continue to buy gas stoves when they are obviously inferior?
1987 2018-12-19 20:52:58 Did not think to bring my planner or a book to my oil change but maybe it’s ok to just sit here and not do anything productive for once
1988 2018-12-19 20:52:57 whether this #Survivor rumour is true or not just because vegas has been right means nothing to me they can be wrong too it happens THC oil is not gonna help Mike White win this game, it's just not.
1989 2018-12-19 20:52:24 You doubled production of oil sands in 8 years. It's hardly existential. It's 'maybe I should take my foot off the gas until I deal with the bottleneck.'
1990 2018-12-19 20:52:21 よろしくお願いします
1991 2018-12-19 20:52:18 What’s the status on the fossil fuel $? I have gotten many emails about Beto today but yesterday it was revealed he took oil $... Beto have you returned the $ yet?
1992 2018-12-19 20:52:17 @TylerFlorence Olive Oil on sale @WilliamsSonoma for $15.99, just saying...  & yes it’s on my Christmas wish list!

当時思ってたのはこんな無駄なことしてそこそこ利益を出してるって、すげーなと(笑)
1995 2018-12-19 20:52:07 All I want for Christmas is a vat of New Season olive oil
1996 2018-12-19 20:52:04 You and your boss need to realize y’all are slowly killing Louisiana with the oil prices and quit kissing the saudis asses and I don’t give a shit if the door peddlers ever get out of jail they broke the law. Losing our retirement savings, jobs are falling off, change r no vote.
1997 2018-12-19 20:51:47 You do realize that there are industries that rely on oil that there is no suitable replacement yet.  Like healthcare. So if your so against oil don’t go to a hospital you will be supporting an industry you are against.
1998 2018-12-19 20:51:41 Claire Ridge, 2018. Seriously, stop peddling your own 'no oil' lies. It doesn't take but 10 minutes researching to educate yourself on oil and gas in our waters. That includes East of England too.
1999 2018-12-19 20:51:37 Not following Alberta in cutting oil production cuts.
2000 2018-12-19 20:51:32 You, and the oil industry, still refuse to believe that it is dilbit - a spill in water - not pipelines, that is the problem. That was the central objection to Energy East amongst Ottawa and Montreal citizens. It is also central to the lower mainland BC objection.
2001 2018-12-19 20:51:24 @LuckerDog @Rum_Bull just like the fish oil and coconut oil fads.
2002 2018-12-19 20:51:14 Everytime. I just need my oil changed bud.
2003 2018-12-19 20:51:11 Screw this. I want a success pill. Preferably in the form of a vitamin or essential oil. Where is BigPharma and GNC when you need them?
2004 2018-12-19 20:51:05 Win Jan canola up A$4.97/t & EU rape up A$4.99. Both helped by weaker A$ vs euro & C$. Another sale of US soybns to China but market still disappointed with the volumes to date. Oilseeds under pressure from current low crude oil prices.
2005 2018-12-19 20:51:02 Reading your response to what I had to say does not make you a better mechanic, it just makes you ignorant. I fully understand the role(s) oil plays on the internal workings of an engine, your limited understanding, but acting smart is why you cannot comprehend those complexities
2006 2018-12-19 20:50:59 add a flavour

2007 2018-12-19 20:50:59 you can see what a panorama in the Middle East @PentagonPresSec, Iraq and Saudi Arabia plus the emirates in the middle, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Yemen, with the complaisance of the Senate leaving the area, do not you depend on that oil?
2008 2018-12-19 20:50:50 To the cute ass girl at auto zone, 
Make sure you change your oil on time next time
And I hope I see you again 
2009 2018-12-19 20:50:46 Powell definitely sticking it to @realDonaldTrump. Low oil and high dollar going to kill American economy if it hasn’t already.
2010 2018-12-19 20:50:45 toss hot oil at his face
2011 2018-12-19 20:50:43 Genius, Western countries need to stop buying oil and gas from Russia = immediate collapse of Putin's regime. Buying oil and gas from Russia is another act of sabotage and a march to suicide. The role of the patsy Putin is to hit the US, Europe with nukes.
2012 2018-12-19 20:50:42 Cash is king right now sold all my oil plays on the fed hike. Will look to re enter soon. Maybe this week or next. 95%cash for now. Had a good day on the oil run
2013 2018-12-19 20:50:41 never taking my car to get my oil changed ever again, michael & drew can!
2014 2018-12-19 20:50:30 and the coconut oil 
2015 2018-12-19 20:50:30 Powell definitely sticking it to @realDonaldTrump. Low oil and high dollar going to kill American economy if it hasn’t already.
2016 2018-12-19 20:50:24 Try CBD oil. It’s better for you.
2017 2018-12-19 20:50:19 Top 10 oil producing countries are

USA
Saudi
USSR

China
Iran
Iraq
UAE
Brazil
Kuwait

Which 1 of those countries have better enviromental, social, employment standards then Canada

Im sorry....u have no argument
2018 2018-12-19 20:50:16 I'm hydrating my hair with coconut oil, exfoliating my face with cornmeal+honey and I'm going to use a clay facial mask. It's so good to have a day off from work 
2019 2018-12-19 20:50:14 When I looked at this in 2015 the only bank with significant oil loan exposure was $NA

Do you know the percentage of their loan books that’s exposed?
2020 2018-12-19 20:50:14 Without those ladies & men you wouldn’t have

A home 
Food
Clothes
Heat or air conditioning 
Nothing to buy
No electricity 
No electronics
Transportation (including bikes & shoes) 
Nothing.

Everything comes on a truck, ship, plane or train.  Including foreign oil.  
2021 2018-12-19 20:50:12 Removing sanctions on Deripaska & Rusal- came out of the TREASON SUMMIT in Helsinki! 

Trump has to earn the BRIBE he gets from Putin as a part of his 19% interest in Rosneft Oil. 

Trump’s next move is to unilaterally attempt to remove sanctions from Russia!
2022 2018-12-19 20:50:06 My doc yesterday, “If you take 8000 mg of fish oil at night, you won’t have anxiety, but you might have diarrhea.”  

Alrighty then.
2023 2018-12-19 20:50:05 creditors seem to be softening given growing evidence our true deficits will be even higher: entitlements & inability to cut spending.Moves to price oil in other currencies lead to attempts to get away from $.We'll see... tax receipts should fall as well given reliance on stocks
2024 2018-12-19 20:49:21 2) It is high time  to begin  arresting our past rulers to give account of Nigerian peoples poverty. Why are we poor despite multiple trillions dollars earned from oil sale? We need disgorgement.We need accounting. Where is Nigeria's money? OBJ, IBB, Jonathan, where is our money?
2025 2018-12-19 20:49:20 Only a small minority of industry advocates are climate change deniers. Don’t lump us in with them. 

By supporting Canadian oil and gas you’re supporting the environment, ethics, and human rights. We have the highest standards on earth, period.

2028 2018-12-19 20:49:03 Yesterday, at roughly the same time as my commute today, my train smelled of burning oil and metal by the time we arrived at Rosemont. I went to tell the conductor but he was already discussing the problem with another CTA employee.
2029 2018-12-19 20:49:01 We must diversify both products and markets. Not just substitute one for the other.
Plenty of FNs - majority on routes - exercise their rights in joining projects others are not part of.
Tanker ban discriminates against Canadian oil while foreign oil proceeds as usual.
2030 2018-12-19 20:48:56 Good, then stop protesting it.
Let us build the Energy East pipeline so we can displace more Saudi, Russian, Venezuelan, and American oil in the world market.

Out of major producers Canada is by far the most ecologically considerate, stop the self-destruction.
2031 2018-12-19 20:48:47 Chairman Powell acted as a burocrat. Dovish yes, but markets let him know is the responsible for 9%/12% markets below October levels, 40% lower oil markets, flattening yield curve, no sensitivity to QT.... President Trump will step in anytime to support markets imho
China deal?
2032 2018-12-19 20:48:35 Cream contour ? Add in some facial oil drops or something
2033 2018-12-19 20:48:26 Plz name me one option poll that’s been right in the last 10 years snake oil sales men
2034 2018-12-19 20:48:26 If only we could find an abundant amount of oil in Africa, then we could deal with the other terrorist groups as well. Everyone could use a little Murican freedom.
2035 2018-12-19 20:48:26 Alberta Oil, should be known as #conflictfree.
No Bombing campaigns here.
2036 2018-12-19 20:48:23 Keep some good fats in your diet? Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, grape seed oil, avocado.. Mmmm
2037 2018-12-19 20:48:19 but question how is having THC oil cheating? @alexkidwell does it give him powers? like i know what it is but i always assumed anything weed related would be a hindrance on survivor.
2038 2018-12-19 20:48:15 Wrong again. Old mothballed oil plants have been fired up for use in cold snaps since the days of the pool, long before the current RE expansion. Its just switching to coal fired plants, which to be honest i dont know if the emmissions are bettee or worse than oil.
2039 2018-12-19 20:48:11 Win Jan canola up A$4.97/t & EU rape up A$4.99. Both helped by weaker A$ vs euro & C$. Another sale of US soybns to China but market still disappointed with the volumes to date. Oilseeds under pressure from current low crude oil prices.
2040 2018-12-19 20:48:11 Oh look another snake oil salesman selling the resistance some fables about how the Trump govt will collapse, buy his book of course to get the full story 
2041 2018-12-19 20:48:09 ISIS. is not defeated. Iran is there & will threaten oil supply (Shipping lanes). Russia will have more power to fuck with us,in a thousand different ways. In that order. Also, supported the relatively moderate Kurds,who helped us defeat ISIS & not letting Erdogan fuck with 'em
2042 2018-12-19 20:48:05 Hey Mike, diabetes gotcha down? I have some snake oil I can cure it with for only $99.99!!
2043 2018-12-19 20:48:03 Visto!
He echado en falta a China (al menos sale en el minuto final ), Venezuela, que se desmoronó (en parte) por la caída del precio y el peak oil, mencionado sólo de pasada, con dudas y hablando de 2030 (muchos dicen que ya lo hemos pasado!) ...
2044 2018-12-19 20:48:02 I'm the thick one. You still want oil the tax isn't going to make me drive to work less so I still need oil but you are against Canada supplying the oil. 
Tax to cut down on oil does not effect pipelines. They are two separate things. Pull out another insult as you make no sense.
2045 2018-12-19 20:47:58 I brought Wanda some cream to put on her arms and she said “this isn’t none of that cannibas oil is it”

2048 2018-12-19 20:47:51 Ask yourself, Why is that so in a resource (oil)rich place like Nigeria? It it because Foreigners profit from the resources and indigenous people live in poverty?
2049 2018-12-19 20:47:38 I couldn’t date anyone who’s got that much oil in their body 
2050 2018-12-19 20:47:25 Gold diggers diggin til they find oil
2051 2018-12-19 20:47:14 Yes. The Tebow helmet was nearly as bad an investment as the two trump oil paintings.
2052 2018-12-19 20:47:11 ああ 気付けばカラダは蜂の巣 ドクドク 流れるVirgin Oil
2053 2018-12-19 20:47:08 Yup, the IEA doesn't forecast how much oil and gas we "need" - that part is @Suncor's interpretation. IEA projects what might happen, none of which are most likely forecasts either. Suncor is definitely choosing to promote a worldview that fits their business.
2054 2018-12-19 20:47:04 So a city in a country that doesn’t rely on the natural resource sector to fuel its economy is declaring an emergency which once again shows the hypocrisy of the movement. Their biggest industries are finance and service sectors, they have nothing to lose by going after oil.

2056 2018-12-19 20:46:43 When was the last time you heard a Democrat in Congress express concern about the 5+ million children living in poverty in the USA, the homeless epidemic or ending the non stop senseless wars for oil? #Resist that. #yellowvestUSA #REVOLUTIONNOW
2057 2018-12-19 20:46:35 As long as oil was above $100/barrel Chavez had foreign revenue to subsidize domestic prices held by law under the cost of production. When the oil money got halved & subsidies went away they didn't let go of the price controls, so nothing got made.
2058 2018-12-19 20:46:32 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2059 2018-12-19 20:46:31 He is a gimp that both xbots and ponies laugh at. The oil Used for wrestling helps him get elbow deep in reggie's ass.
2060 2018-12-19 20:46:24 Tom on the flip side Americas greatest weapon against #Iran & #Russia is #OIL (same w Saudis & OPEC)-if we can beeak the back of Iran & get regime change through sanctions & orher means getting out of #Syria may be right call @sullivanradio
2061 2018-12-19 20:46:16 @LuckerDog @Rum_Bull farm bill, bro. Soon there will be enough hemp oil to buy gallons of it at Costco.
2062 2018-12-19 20:46:04 Looking at pres Buhari's budget it is safe to project that interest rates will rise next year since estimates for crude oil output and prices appear skewed high. This  means revenue shortfalls are likely, leading therefore to a bigger deficit with resultant high interest rates.
2063 2018-12-19 20:46:02 The vet said to give olive or coconut oil and that sorted her right out! 
2064 2018-12-19 20:45:53 Take them down. If anyone should get our tax money, give it to Elon & Tesla. Introduce real competition to oil & gas, right here in Canada. End Oil Lobby Groups.
2065 2018-12-19 20:45:48 Time for an oil change
2066 2018-12-19 20:45:47 What does your name mean?
2067 2018-12-19 20:45:35 Beto promotes clean energy jobs and talked at every campaign rally about climate change as an existential threat demanding immediate attention. And he did this courageously in rural east Texas, where oil jobs are dominant. People pushing this garbage are uninformed or smearing.
2068 2018-12-19 20:45:34 ‘Tis the week before Christmas & I have so much to do. Some tasks are fun:shopping, wrapping, spending time with family/friends.But some are chores: grading, cooking, ordering glasses & getting my oil changed. Thanks, though,  @SubaruPuyallup for making the latter a joy. #holiday
2069 2018-12-19 20:45:34 Not how you make hummus. Don't process the olive oil. Don't used canned beans. Don't use raw garlic.
2070 2018-12-19 20:45:19 @Beau_C_Williams I am ashamed to say I lost the photo of your oil blend, but if we ever meet I shall blend something for you in person!
2071 2018-12-19 20:45:15 #DidYouKnow? It's actually natural & beneficial for hair to have a light oil film.
2072 2018-12-19 20:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2073 2018-12-19 20:45:03 Nah dog we just tend to be too reactionary. 
Oil is important. We all know it. Are they important enough that I need to defend our oil execs from a carbon tax that barely affects the working man but refills our treasury and lowers taxes overall?

2078 2018-12-19 20:44:55 Measures like? I have lived in such communities b4, u dare not tell security operatives, those oil bunkerers are really dangerous. Govt can't really tell when it's taking place
2079 2018-12-19 20:44:55 could be something that has been in your diet for awhile, but your body just developed an intolerance to it--happened to me w olive oil.
2080 2018-12-19 20:44:48 Desperate selfish people will destroy everything around them before leaving with the thought that if they can’t have it no one can.  Like saddam burning the oil fields.  Watch for him be more extreme and destructive. I wonder who he talks to in Florida? #Safehouse Maralago
2081 2018-12-19 20:44:44 FYI. 76 years ago plastic was made from soybeans during WW2. Oil shortages. It was degradable. The bubbles for B17 bombers were made from that.
2082 2018-12-19 20:44:43 No I get that. Like, I love truffles so much but also don’t want all my food drowning in truffle oil to get that bit of umami flavor
2083 2018-12-19 20:44:39 The oil rigs would be a good alternative. You know, equal and all that.
2084 2018-12-19 20:44:38 It’s the elites in Quebec. Just look to the offshore company that transports the oil from Saudi to Quebec. That may give you the real reason. Follow the money.
2085 2018-12-19 20:44:30 So I guess my point is I think people have been a little misled (likely from ignorance by folks writing about the topic, not deliberately), so they get their cheap Crosley turntable and go "this doesn't sound better, it's snake oil!" And so the cause of music is set back.
2086 2018-12-19 20:44:26 Stock market is over 6000 pts better from his Presidency started.
Unemployment is lower
Wages are higher
The economy is booming
We are oil independent for the first time in over 70 years. 
Once again, you have proven you are a propaganda media site.
2087 2018-12-19 20:44:25 These pics have so much oil nje it’s annoying, mkhaba must be recognized
2088 2018-12-19 20:44:18 These people make me sick - we are the laughing stock of the world - we have a needed, viable resource, that our government refuses access to while we purchase very expensive foreign oil - are we stupid or what - how do we get rid of this bunch - early
2089 2018-12-19 20:43:53 Because they were likely sold to our friends in the US who are now the 2nd largest producer and exporter of oil?
2090 2018-12-19 20:43:52 God blesses the works of our hands, meaning we must find something to do. The challenge is everyone wants to be a Christian while they are attached to their own religion at the same time, talking about Zimbabwe. It won’t work, oil and water don’t mix. Christianity is life!
2091 2018-12-19 20:43:45 Most of us do love people, animals and the earth. How do you heat your home? Fly to Europe? What are you typing your tweets on? We all need petroleum and Canadian oil & gas is clean and the most environmentally responsible and ethically produced.
2092 2018-12-19 20:43:36 "Show respect" and "Donald J Trump" are like water and oil....

Did Trump show "Respect" to @SenJohnMcCain ??   I bet that pissed you off
2093 2018-12-19 20:43:33 Boo. He's drowning in oil money and how could he beat Trump if he lost to Cruz--who also lost to Trump?
2094 2018-12-19 20:43:24 What material? Peroxide works wonders!! Also Fast Orange! It’s great for removing stains, I stained my shirt with oil from hot sauce on thxgiving and without having to take my shirt off I got the stains out
2095 2018-12-19 20:43:14 No the fries cooked and ricotta are not very good ... But then a lot of the same oil ... No they would not do for me 
2096 2018-12-19 20:43:09 There is a very interesting comment about using taxpayer funds to pay TCIL to get info on oil companies and therefore contracts This is corruption!

2098 2018-12-19 20:43:07 Yep, let the M.E. figure it out. When oil goes up 5x, when heads start getting chopped off on nightly news, somehow it will be America’s fault. What is the $ for world security? The Iranians have been asking this for years. Those countries are Islamist regions? #MeOnTheWall
2099 2018-12-19 20:43:07 Some other "worthless" industries, based on Cross' 3.1% of GDP criterion: oil & gas extraction (2.7%), residential building construction (2.5%), information & culture industries (3.1%), telecommunications (1.8%), insurance (1.7%), elementary & secondary schls (3.0%) @cdnpoli
2100 2018-12-19 20:42:46 ...for the oil industry.
2101 2018-12-19 20:42:45 Because the community leaders are always involved. There's no way u will steal oil in a community without members of community involvement

I might make it after all 
2104 2018-12-19 20:42:39 President Barack Obama met with Military advisors endlessly, he read reams of reports and agonized over his Military decisions, burning the midnight oil deep in thought.  Trump woke up this morning and said Eh, I'll just pull 2000 troops out of Syria, what the hell!
2105 2018-12-19 20:42:32 Trump n Kudlow no better than the rest killing us on the market, oil prices killing us in Louisiana, same old story the rich gets richer and the poor gets kicked in the teeth, the republicans want stay together and work together. They all are self serving idiots no faith n Trump.
2106 2018-12-19 20:42:18 Get some peppermint oil and rub it on your temples

2109 2018-12-19 20:41:37 “Give me billions & I’ll throw a few crumbs for oil exploration”. And your point is?
2110 2018-12-19 20:41:34 @chigrl Any updates on gold, spx and oil?
2111 2018-12-19 20:41:32 After quadruple witching day oil prices to rebound to 65 .. the italian problem still persisting dont fall into tria trap .. always sell eurusd rallies
2112 2018-12-19 20:41:26 Conservative politicians & con media are beating the hate drums, & it's working. The problem is tough; US is out to hose us, an oil glut, dirty oil that's hard to process, dilbit that's dangerous, a very irregular BC coast.
2113 2018-12-19 20:41:17 We want to join the exact country we claim has been waging a war against Canadian oil for the last several years
2114 2018-12-19 20:41:15 Oil left the fundamental porch a while back and it is refusing to get back in line with either global current inventory levels or those seen in the USA. Rational oil value is being ignored at the moment or as some say, it is trading on pure sentiment???
2115 2018-12-19 20:41:06 Tea tree oil does WONDERS on acne 
2116 2018-12-19 20:41:02 Great work admitting it; it's tough to recognize, much less confess. We are happy to help in any way we can, but we can't help as much as your doctor can. But short of medication, some also have luck managing with sunshine and fish oil. I hope it gives you a break soon!
2117 2018-12-19 20:41:02 All the States (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Rivers, Delta, Ondo, Cross River, Imo, Edo &amp; Abia) in the Niger Delta in Nigeria have crude oil reserves
2118 2018-12-19 20:41:01 I've been having good luck with taking cbd oil.
2119 2018-12-19 20:40:59 I mixed everything together adding coconut oil and black seed oil.using it like a normal hair cream
2120 2018-12-19 20:40:59 Scotland is leading the world in green energy. People will still however buy oil.
2121 2018-12-19 20:40:44 A pipeline would mean that we wouldn’t have to sell our oil almost exclusively to the US. So yes, it would fix that.
2122 2018-12-19 20:40:38 Only dealings the US should have with the Middle East is business regarding energy and oil (if only solar energy for fuel was mainstream). That’s it. No more weapons deals or intruding on governments.
2123 2018-12-19 20:40:30 But Scotland would negotiate as an independent country - and don’t forget oor oil
2124 2018-12-19 20:40:28 Its when u want to confuse yourself not nation that u start using confused terms! When govt is adding money to a cost anywhere in the world its subsidy! Is $1b not part of oil revenue!
2125 2018-12-19 20:40:22 Alberta separation? What a great idea! After they separate they sure won't need any cooperation from BC to get their oil to market!  THAT'S using the Alberta smarts we've all come to know and love!
2126 2018-12-19 20:40:21 I know this is all expensive, imo the best place to go is Walmart and get warranty on your tires. I also get my oil changed there. So when I go in for my oil change, they also balance and rotate my tires for me.
2127 2018-12-19 20:40:17 Yo pussy need a whole new motor and a air freshener!!!!! that’s what happens when u over work it wit no oil.... SMH HIGH MILEAGE PUSSY NEED ALL ITS FLUIDS

2131 2018-12-19 20:39:51 How's it negligence o! Is it not ur fellow masses that are bunkering oil?
2132 2018-12-19 20:39:50 Definitely. Hell, you had all 3 in the early 90s. From army town recessions during desert storm to oil uncertainty due to same to the lingering fallout of the s&l crisis.
2133 2018-12-19 20:39:49 " Your territory, oil fields etc . " ? They aren't Kurdish, they are SYRIA  property stolen by Kurds.
2134 2018-12-19 20:39:47 Yup - know a chap who has had an exceptional post soviet and now conventional oil career. His (infantry) OC would have been amazed at his corporate success. I suspect he’d had been more effective in your or a more imaginative MOS #PowerAndInfluence
2135 2018-12-19 20:39:45 You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.

Heb 1:9
2136 2018-12-19 20:39:42 the usa used the kurds anyways for the oil
2137 2018-12-19 20:39:30 "Here, I found one example where I think letting a company do whatever they wanted was better than what we got after government regulation" does not prove anything.

Unregulated Standard Oil also caused the Cuyahoga River to burn all the way back in 1868. I'm not impressed.
2138 2018-12-19 20:39:20 @realDonaldTrump  love our President but this senior citizen confused.. North Eastern Ohio electric bill way up $$$ for less use than last year, heating oil $500 for small tank fill-up small house, and Medicare charging me more ($135) a month for lowest, basic health coverage. ??
2139 2018-12-19 20:39:06 The next available oil change is next Thursday. Ehhhh. Ok 
2140 2018-12-19 20:39:00 Your head get oil.. Let's set a committee to deliberate on this issue.
2141 2018-12-19 20:38:57 Its okay Sorry. I wanted to patronize you
2142 2018-12-19 20:38:43 I’m not saying Govt should be excluded from responsibility. My point is to INCLUSION of biggest beneficiaries of oil sands.
2143 2018-12-19 20:38:39 face mask: on

2148 2018-12-19 20:38:18 Over 120 people from across the UK’s oil and gas industry gathered in Aberdeen today to mark the launch of a new book which aims to inspire the next generation of female talent.

2150 2018-12-19 20:38:02 Well the USA used the Kurds anyways for the oil... otherwise they wouldnt care about them...
2151 2018-12-19 20:38:00 Seriously.. record employment.. record wages... record investments.. pulling out of Syria.. 
And worse than Vietnam.. the oil shock.. 2008... etc etc 
Idiot...
2152 2018-12-19 20:38:00 And without Canada's infrastructure support Alberta oil would be worthless--unless there's an secret dirigible sector there that none of us is aware of. This is a silly roundabout argument.
2153 2018-12-19 20:37:58 Priced right! Our Filter-Carts are easy to use and effective tools that will restore the purity of an oil or coolant. The user will save thousands of $$'s in replacement and disposal costs.
2154 2018-12-19 20:37:57 Semis guiding down, housing slowing, global growth slowing, yield curve inverting, trade wars breaking out, oil crashing daily, credit spreads widening, inflation tame, dollar is strong. Better hurry and raise rates, no time to wait.
2155 2018-12-19 20:37:53 Stop blaming the conservatives it was your government that kill Energy East it was your government that killed Northern Gateway Trudeau campaigned in that and it was your government the put a oil tanker ban on the W coast all had Nothing to do with Harper
2156 2018-12-19 20:37:52 Appreciate it! Didn't know that they found oil at that time.

2158 2018-12-19 20:37:47 Sure, you invested heavily in oil & gas, insufficiently in wind & solar, but you got huge subsidies by way of tax breaks. There's still time for a change of hearts & minds, however. Imagine how long Suncor could remain in profitable business by switching.

Why do Oilers fans drink from a saucer?

2161 2018-12-19 20:37:28 We don't get the money we used to for that oil. 

It's really a non issue due to global constraints.

2165 2018-12-19 20:37:12 I worry for my daughter. She has chronic Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. She has major damage. She has it in every joint. She’s 22. No opioids. But now her pain is so accute, she can’t function. CBD oil, Boron, diet and light Yoga helped her. Now though...

2167 2018-12-19 20:37:10 “But to those who think it's a chance to push hate & racism, I urge you to stop. You're undercutting your neighbours & our cause.”

Guess you’re a racist if u accuse Notley of closing down the private sector & oil industry in Alta? That’s a different tact.
2168 2018-12-19 20:37:03 It would seem that it's vegan or no at all oil is vegan since other oils are less efficient meaning far more deforestation. The Orangutan charities want sustainable palm oil for this reason, a total boycott just kills more animals elsewhere, but saying this is unpopular.

2184 2018-12-19 20:35:45 @INCIndia made a pact during last regime with oil companies.
2185 2018-12-19 20:35:39 Aaaaaand, you’re wrong.
Let’s go back to Standard Oil. Without the government, Standard Oil produced a safer, less volatile kerosene.
Thus a superior product. I know “but monopoly”. The government got involved because people who sucked couldn’t compete, they picked.

2188 2018-12-19 20:35:19 What a lot of people don;t know is that the refinery in Edmonton pipes refined oil to ON where they package it and return it to AB and other accounts across the country and that;s been going on since the fifties.

2190 2018-12-19 20:35:10 Part of your argument is for the US to steal other countries oil...which will only impoverish and kill more Syrians. Your thoughts are not very logical
2191 2018-12-19 20:35:09 It’s the lack of pipelines.  And Alberta supporting the entire country & being handcuffed financially.  

Right now there is a backlog of oil & we cannot get ours anywhere else.  The government is even trying to buy tanker cars to get trains rolling.  Alberta is standing up.
2192 2018-12-19 20:35:04 Cronies should admire Al Gore.  Making a fortune, selling crony snake oil. ManBearPig is an Avatar for Cronyism at its worst.
2193 2018-12-19 20:35:03 I suspect you'd be cautious about allowing oil tankers to sail up and down the Georgia Strait if you actually lived on west coast.   Activism lead to 5 day work week, universal health care, child labour laws and much more.
2194 2018-12-19 20:34:41 Please stay away from canola and other seed oils. Use coconut oil instead.
2195 2018-12-19 20:34:38 Stock market not looking too hot for 2019. Trade wars and higher rates. Think a 10% drop is possible from these levels. This is why Presidents shouldn't take credit for stock market numbers (or oil prices), not enough control over the factors. Now you get all the blame. Enjoy GOP
2196 2018-12-19 20:34:29 CurmudgeonCD21 TedHalstead TheCLCouncil PostOpinions The bill introduced in the House is the policy CCL has advocated for 10 years. Oil companies were not involved. Where are you getting that from?
2197 2018-12-19 20:34:26 The way ladies will bathe with goya oil and start looking for sun light like solar panel just because they want to lie against the innocent sun that it kissed them is really hilarious
2198 2018-12-19 20:34:17 CBD oil is a fucking god send. Where has this been my entire anxiety riddled life and why am I only trying it out til now??
2199 2018-12-19 20:34:09 We are too comfortable with only one buyer of our oil for a long time. Now the US transformed from net oil importer to net oil exporter. We have a domestic market for oil, but the market is not for Alberta. Our market is reserved for other countries.
2200 2018-12-19 20:34:07 In theory .... If I was going to buy Santa beard oil ..... what is the absolute best ?
2201 2018-12-19 20:34:03 Literally why tf has it taken all day to get an oil change wtf
2202 2018-12-19 20:34:02 Hi Diane, I'm sorry you're having trouble getting it off - let some vegetable oil sit for about 20 minutes and the rest should peel right off.
2203 2018-12-19 20:33:57 You can do research yourself. The UN posted a study that animal ag. produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation sector combined…transportation uses oil. Animal ag. is also the leading cause of ocean dead zones, something you seemed to be worried about

2220 2018-12-19 20:32:24 Finally! Getting an overdue oil change.
2221 2018-12-19 20:32:23 I’d like to know what kind of payoffs the Liberals are getting from the Middle East (and maybe the USA) to keep killing our oil industry in favour of imports.
2222 2018-12-19 20:32:23 Lol can't wait for laid off oil workers... To pay for health care and not get ei? So nonsensical
2223 2018-12-19 20:32:16 Prez DT: We must keep some troops for a long time- &  for military training- in Kurdishstan- to protect our v.impt Kurdish allies from Turkey-  & the oil fields-.be there stationed without conflict..DMLAL4Peace
2224 2018-12-19 20:32:13 "Big Oil has been whining non-stop for government handouts..."

That is an absolute lie. 

"meanwhile they've collected billions in profits off resources that belong to Canadians."

Yeah, and that's why Canadians collect billions in royalties and taxes on those resources, dummy.
2225 2018-12-19 20:32:08 Where is the oil money?  Arabs have been blessed with unimaginable wealth, where is it being spent?

2228 2018-12-19 20:31:55 @federalreserve raised rates 0.25% today despite lowering its expected 2019 growth to 2.4%. Inflation never reached 2% and now falling. Have they seen oil price? Incredible!

2232 2018-12-19 20:31:37 I never paid much attention to the oil patch and do not know much about  how it works. When the oil prices were high, how was the oil transported ?And why is there such a panic now to get the oil out when the price of oil is much lower?

2238 2018-12-19 20:31:16 Got an oil change and the Dealership suggested $2k worth of stuff.
2239 2018-12-19 20:31:13 I previously owned stakes in all the rails (and had for a while). It is a bit tougher of a business than I initially thought. If you’re looking for cheap logistics without competition I’d suggest looking at oil and gas midstream. Much easier business imo.
2240 2018-12-19 20:31:03 @jasonhickel How would you calculate the resources stolen by "white people" from the native Americans---land, minerals, agriculture, oil, water, animals...?

2242 2018-12-19 20:30:56 A scary thing is that some big companies don’t give this a thought. My fellow used to design software that ran oil refineries. He got yelled at for not identifying an alarm. “What alarm?” They pointed to something blinking on his screen. He was puzzled. It was then they …
2243 2018-12-19 20:30:51 Oil companies have regulators too.

2253 2018-12-19 20:29:56 The issue is tree hugging hippies and hypocrites trying to get in the way of making money.  They don’t realize that the advancement in technology prevents spills and leaks.  If those people are so dead set on no oil, stop using ALL oil based products, including phones & vehicles.
2254 2018-12-19 20:29:53 Just waiting F I r Trump to sneak and lift oil sanctions. I hope someone in a very high place with major power is still on American Democracy's side. We're in deep shit.
2255 2018-12-19 20:29:40 Search LinkedIn there are lots of opportunities in the oil and gas sector for Petroleum Engineers.
2256 2018-12-19 20:29:37 This budget is seriously threatened with the sliding of price of crude oil. The budget benchmark is in danger.
2257 2018-12-19 20:29:14 QUANTITATIVE EASING IS A CONSPIRACY THEORY.

2261 2018-12-19 20:28:53 Your statement is wrong there is still an increasing market for oil and oil products The problem is lack of pipelines to tidal water, & Quebec not allowing oil pipelines through the province. BTW most countries have heavy oil and the dirtiest oil in North America is in California
2262 2018-12-19 20:28:51 @DeborahMeaden hi. I believe you were aware of the fake Bitcoin scam that falsely used you and Dragons Den within a fake Mirror article.
Don't know whether you know but there is also an identical Facebook ad BUT substituting Cannabis Oil for Bitcoin ....
2263 2018-12-19 20:28:50 Nothing to win? Erdogan needs funds for Turkey's financial problems and Syrian North-East has oil wells. Isn't the "good"" relation between KRG-Iraq and Erdogan family not build on oil?

2266 2018-12-19 20:28:24 So what's the problem . Especially as my original reply was about how the UK gave the oil companies tax cuts but Norway took tax off them the question is why ?
2267 2018-12-19 20:28:12 Dr Fred Beach, UofTx, in my interview: "Just like the whale oil guys in the 1850s, the end is nigh, but the producers just don't want to admit to it yet."
2268 2018-12-19 20:28:11 my 2.25 1950s tech Land Rover carb and points petrol always is way under on emissions and doesnt burn a drop of oil although it does leak out other ways being a landrover!!!
2269 2018-12-19 20:28:09 I just came back from a year on the coast near javea. And believe me, Northern Europe money is the oil of that place. Up and down.
2270 2018-12-19 20:28:05 Fact.
Bakken oil railed to New Brunswick, then consumed in Eastern Canada.

Question:
How much Sask oil is discounted to the USA, and shipped back thru NB to Quebec &Ontario at global prices?
2271 2018-12-19 20:27:59 Got my oil changed and Ron didn’t even have to tell me to. Adult 
2272 2018-12-19 20:27:58 Yeah, Chrysler in general seems to have terrible electronics. Our Liberty had a ghost oil light. I changed the oil pump, sending unit, used OEM filter... even 2 shops couldn't figure it out. All int. Lights came on once in a while too haha. Newer the Jeep more likely a problem...
2273 2018-12-19 20:27:55 I'm calling bottom to this stock market slide...3:00 pm 12/19/18...fundamentals too sound, interest rates and oil low...what's not to like. China trade resolution...Mueller/Trump resolution...Budget resolution...all likely favorable catalysts.
2274 2018-12-19 20:27:51 I believe there is plenty of oil in the world, it is just hidden and not found yet, we should focus on alternative ways of energy that are not polluting the planet like China.

How can we depend on someone to fight for a #GreenNewDeal when they take a mountain of cash from the gas/oil industry? We can't. A vote for @BetoORourke is a vote for #GlobalWarming. You may not give a squirt of piss about the future, but the rest of us do.
2277 2018-12-19 20:27:32 Bring car in for an oil change and find out we need new brakes and a water pump...solid start to the road trip...better to find out now than on i20 in middle of night I guess...

2286 2018-12-19 20:26:32 97% of their economy is based on Oil. And the Saud family takes a huge chunk of the profits off that. What's left over isn't enough to fund the government.
2287 2018-12-19 20:26:31 i put olive oil all over my body and massaged it in before taking a shower. my skin feels fantastic now!!! 
2288 2018-12-19 20:26:22 Also if their paws are dry in the winter you can put coconut oil on them I do it for the doggies!
2289 2018-12-19 20:26:22 Please know that the largest refinery in Canada is the privately owned one in New Brunswick, Irving oil. Yes, they choose to importSaudi oil. Neither our PM Trudeau or our Premier Notley make that decision, #Headinthesand Stinky.

2294 2018-12-19 20:25:54 Lol. Oil is extracted from bitumen. Not tar, nor pixy dust. Are you just playing stupid or is this your natural state?
2295 2018-12-19 20:25:53 WTI down 40% since October 2, poor outlook today from the Fed Chair on US economy in 2019. If Kenney wins in 2019, what's his plan to insulate Alberta from the falling price of oil and a potential recession starting in the US?

2298 2018-12-19 20:25:49 Chevy charges 35/40 for an oil change and because they booked I just spend 80 dollars somewhere else 
2299 2018-12-19 20:25:46 The oil company was a CIA front.

2302 2018-12-19 20:25:29 Funny we dont see you saying this at any pro oil and gas rallies
2303 2018-12-19 20:25:27 I took Hadley and Ida to the hood streets of New York to get my favorite oil from this African man on the corner 
2304 2018-12-19 20:25:24 You’re such a beauty
2305 2018-12-19 20:25:14 For sure.
Not only France, many countries could invent and produce more green energy. But the oil lobbies are too strong and our government too weak.
2306 2018-12-19 20:25:13 if u put oil in ur car it doesnt sound like a chainsaw when u accelerate! who would have thought!
2307 2018-12-19 20:25:13 I mean you can add oil and oregano if you want, but you can put nutella on iT when theres nothing on top and it's GOOD
2308 2018-12-19 20:25:06 Bobby - let me ask: do you think it's right for the US government to spend trillions to invade another nation to control their oil & reap profits for politicians & contractors - while letting you or your wife die of cancer... after you spent your life paying taxes ? :(

2314 2018-12-19 20:24:30 Really the only way to make them buy at home is to tariff Saudi oil to where it's uneconomical...

2324 2018-12-19 20:23:36 Scheer on the upcoming federal election and the market for Canadian oil: "We're gonna say yes to big projects that bring Western Canadian energy to Eastern Canadian markets"
2325 2018-12-19 20:23:34 The shipping of the refined products in the volumes they would produce are extremely dangerous and hazardous to transport. Unrefined oil is not as volatile as gasoline products.

2329 2018-12-19 20:23:19 companies by people who developed cancer as result of smoking. But this is not same issues. Cig companies lied, false advertising and adding chemicals to get people hooked. But in this, places like Whistler have used the oil company products to get rich themselves.They benefited.
2330 2018-12-19 20:23:15 "Voters in WA State rejected the creation of an expensive tax on carbon emissions." Among other things, @SenJohnBarrasso, you forgot to mention that oil & gas spent $30 million on ads & false information about this ballot initiative. We either pay a little now or A LOT later.
2331 2018-12-19 20:23:13 I am still a newbie when ur comes to essential oils.  A family member introduced them to me a couple of years ago. They have been very helpful for anxiety.   Dabbling in them a little more these days.  Slightly off topic is CBD oil. I have heard great things about it.
2332 2018-12-19 20:23:09  You are right, nothing funny about Bridges incompetence. Didnt know DOC land given for oil/gas explortn, didnt know PIs engaged to spy in two of his portfolios, didnt know about 20k dodgy WoFs since 2011, one causing death, doesnt know petrol price lower than under Nats,
2333 2018-12-19 20:23:09 We never should have been in Syria in the first place.  It never was about ‘Democracy’, it was about oil and gas.  Money and power, not ‘Democracy’.  Almost as bad as the bullshit reasons for invading Iraq.
2334 2018-12-19 20:23:08 Just praised the cons for what the Liberals are doing took credit for what the Liberals are doing and once again brought up Saudi oil , Just tried to fumble in some gender specific BS as well WOW that was painful
2335 2018-12-19 20:23:08 This feels like the time they flipped out on Yellen for saying the inflation was “transitory” during the oil spike....and then she was right
2336 2018-12-19 20:23:07 @realDonaldTrump #removePowell - he is destroying the economy by raising rates when their is no CPI inflation, oil prices are dropping, etc

2355 2018-12-19 20:21:11 I have read part of the article  ,will read rest later. But still please explain to me how oil companies are responsible basically for OUR choices to use their product or not.
 I get the theory and it is somewhat or modeled loosely on the 20 yrs ago, lawsuits against Cig
2356 2018-12-19 20:21:07 LOL that Amitabh Kant is a snake oil salesman. Must be his spin.

2358 2018-12-19 20:21:02 Which part of fuel increase and decrease is as a result of the world market prices. You should take advantage of this increase and educate people on the role of world oil prices on pricing rather. Because when it goes up I hope you own it this same way.
2359 2018-12-19 20:21:00 Whales, dolphins threatened by seismic airgun blasting for oil. Earlier this month, federal officials authorized five oil and gas exploration companies which would harm & possibly even kill marine life, including critically endangered North Atlantic right whales
2360 2018-12-19 20:21:00 i understand you are confused if you read and post such stupid propaganda excerpts. 
"Gaddafi made Libya wealthy"? Bullshit. When he launched his coup in the 60s, oil just had been found. Libya was going to be rich anyway
2361 2018-12-19 20:20:53 And oil rigs don't kill men because they are men. You keep trying to weasel out of addressing that issue.
2362 2018-12-19 20:20:53 this oil is perfect for skin issus i bought it from morocco and i know friends that sell it and ship it worldwide
2363 2018-12-19 20:20:39 Trumps working on that.  There are plenty of oil/nat gas reserves in the US.  I agree with energy independence, disagree with the belief that alternative sources will get us there.
2364 2018-12-19 20:20:28 oil is a thing
2365 2018-12-19 20:20:26 Other countries are bracing for recession based on projections that oil price will crash. Our budget is based on rise in oil price. Our disconnect from reality is ‘NextLevel’
2366 2018-12-19 20:20:01 Meaning also: makes it easier for Moscow to gain control over all the oil and gasfields of Syria
2367 2018-12-19 20:19:48 Averagely, yes. But if you have to buy everything from the scratch. Gas, oil, seasonings and condiments etc., then that may not be enough. Location & the type of soup matters. Most especially the solid ingredients i.e. Turkey, Bush meat & cat fish cost more
2368 2018-12-19 20:19:38 Legit best way is to cut them in half, toss them in olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast them in the oven. 400° for 15 minutes, then toss them in balsamic vinegar and honey, roast again for 5 minutes. 
2369 2018-12-19 20:19:31 To be clear.. Next will Trump lift oil sanctions?

-Trash NATO 
-Trash our Democratic allies 
-Trash our Intel orgs 
-Kill Green energy to bolster failing Russian oil mono-economy 
-Lift sanctions agnst R 
-Pit Americans agnst each other,plant seeds 4 civil war
2371 2018-12-19 20:19:25 I just cut up chicken, dipped in a beaten egg, then coated with store bought, GF “breadcrumbs.” Fried it in oil.
2372 2018-12-19 20:19:22 Groundnut oil
2373 2018-12-19 20:19:10 Where is your shop
2374 2018-12-19 20:19:10 Yes- 2.30ish%

Relationship with oil suggests closer to 2% as unlikely as that seems :S
2375 2018-12-19 20:19:03 Hi again Holly. Our team for Costco item 14576 Peppermint Candy Bark wished to thank you for your suggestion and provide some additional info regarding the palm oil used in our options offered through Costco Canada Bakeries: that the oil is RSPO certified. TY~James
2376 2018-12-19 20:19:00 Makes me sick to see the Middle East torn to pieces all because of OIL.
2377 2018-12-19 20:18:58 Oil sanctions coming next Noa that he is handing Syria to Russia?
2378 2018-12-19 20:18:57 CBD oil in my smoothies 
2379 2018-12-19 20:18:55 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
2380 2018-12-19 20:18:54 Much in the document contradicts what we actually see government doing in practice, eg oil, fracking, hs2, consumption. But an improvement on Labour's plan that ommits any biodiversity protection. It starts to address environmental issues related to climate collapse. Promising.
2381 2018-12-19 20:18:51 Oil White or Casper Lee merch?
2382 2018-12-19 20:18:42 Talk to Irving Oil about it then.
2383 2018-12-19 20:18:41 Another lie about shipping bans WOW #cdnpoli
this guy has no shame and again say we buy Saudi oil
2384 2018-12-19 20:18:33 We seriously need Oil,  what is this
2385 2018-12-19 20:18:28 I don’t do sales and marketing lol. That’s not something tradespeople do!

Jumbo just outed himself as a liar. Just another full of shit #Foolbertan pretending he has a stake in the oil patch lol. Don’t lie to ppl who actually do - we can smell you fuckers a mile away lol.
2386 2018-12-19 20:18:26 Inter Houston, deportivo Houston, Atletico Houston, Houston Petrolero (oil, get it?), Houston Locomotive (train in our city flag), Houston Tuesday (city founded on Tuesday aug. 30 1836), Hou 2006, Hou 1837 (year incorporated not founded), six flags Hou, Santos Hou, Port Hou
2387 2018-12-19 20:18:25 Have you tried CBD oil, it might help. I understand there are instances that require strong medicine, unfortunately, that's the only thing our Allopathic form of medicine understands and therefore over-prescribes, it's based on profit. Afghanistan poppies
2388 2018-12-19 20:18:24 Oil price following US indices lower currently $47.50
2389 2018-12-19 20:18:20 You can do it just make sure youre using a mild soap like baby dove&moisturizing her good after. For the cradle crap not using shampoo and putting coconut oil cleared my daughters up instantly when she was little.
2390 2018-12-19 20:18:16 What would the unimaginable cost be to keep oil on the wall for 2000 miles: that would be more expensive than Trump's wall. 
Then all of the dirt that sticks to it and health hazards, and then they can probably pole jump the wall since it's not that high anyway, or Trampoline
2391 2018-12-19 20:18:00 Maybe Scheer and Kenney should take a sec, look at this graph, and finally stop shouting around that Quebec prefers importing oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela than from Alberta
2392 2018-12-19 20:17:58 365
2393 2018-12-19 20:17:57 can picture stasia in a target with like a cart full of shit, trying to make the final decision bw an automatic car starter and one of those oil diffusers and just being like "fuck it" and leaving the cart in the aisle
2394 2018-12-19 20:17:54 Team Trudeau and the Liberals are the divisive ones; they have the whole country fighting with itself, oil industry being shut down, red tape to stop export of oil, tanker ban,supports U.N. Migrant Policy,plans carbon tax that exempts elite and taxes families.......
2395 2018-12-19 20:17:44 now that you declare it (isis) defeated , get the hell out o there !! never to go back , we have enough oil and gas to supply ourselves ( soon to switch to mostly electric anyhow).
2396 2018-12-19 20:17:32 Ha you're too funny, so you think women want to work on oil rigs and fishing trawlers and down mines and on skyscrapers but those pesky men won't let them. I think you'll find women don't have the interest in doing those jobs,can't you admit anything
2397 2018-12-19 20:16:58 And LPT is already calculated based on property value. You seem to want to disincentivise people from living close to public transport..
Do you own oil shares or something.
2398 2018-12-19 20:16:57 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil
Yeah, they're gonna dig a coal-face out of you
2399 2018-12-19 20:16:51 Your both wrong.... 3 grams of oil was his crime. Getting your facts straight can be a great way to avoid being perceived as a fool.

2405 2018-12-19 20:16:38 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
2406 2018-12-19 20:16:34 A media report says that a private equity firm is in talks to acquire oil and gas pipeline operator Tallgrass Energy ($TGE).
2407 2018-12-19 20:16:30 Is the yam and oil london used?
2408 2018-12-19 20:16:30 This private Corp is corrupt. To raise rates in the middle of a slow down. With $50 an oil  barrel , and low inflation, clearly they want to screw Trumps economy as there was no reason to raise rates. @realDonaldTrump Audit the Fed or switch to Gold standard
2409 2018-12-19 20:16:27 this is the third time.ive eaten chicken fried in old oil. I think im going to become an xmen
2410 2018-12-19 20:16:15 The country offered a plan that would have built pipelines and had our domestic oil needs met by Alberta and other oil producing regions. But Alberta threw a fit because it wanted to go global. Now we're mad that the NEP was scrapped.
2411 2018-12-19 20:16:13 @realDonaldTrump and #corrupt #PruittEra removed all #environmental standards here in the #US and now point fingers at #Peru ? talk about #hypocrisy and #DoubleStandards . here they go #drilling for oil and gas at #NationalParks and there they #Preach #environment ?
2412 2018-12-19 20:16:13 Amen, & yet when the right time comes, He will pour
His oil upon the oozing sore on our vessel. 
The 1 that keeps us from being filled 2 overflowing by the Holy Spirit. 
He will expose our sin & heal it as we repent from the bottom of our heart. He can & Truley will 
Heal & Fill.

2416 2018-12-19 20:15:45 Look out for my artists book ‘10 bad oil pastel portraits of close up Gregg Wallace’ coming out in 2019 
2417 2018-12-19 20:15:42 If they ever separate, I wonder if they'll be able to convince the oil barons to bail the out when the next natural disaster hits? Oh wait! They don't think those are caused by #ClimateChange. My bad
2418 2018-12-19 20:15:35 I'm a part time barista wearing a top hat, smoking a pipe, and use beard oil, does that mean I am required to go to Burning Man?
2419 2018-12-19 20:15:26 Try swapping out butter for #coconutoil both are high in healthy saturated #fats but unlike butter the fats in coconut oil are #metabolism boosting MCT's - These encourage the body to burn more fat. #fatburning #fatloss #Diet #weightloss
2420 2018-12-19 20:15:26 Kind of like Bob Ross, except that, instead of painting a nice oil picture, he can cause a 400-point Dow loss in a half-hour....
2421 2018-12-19 20:15:23 @oil_shaeikh how much is $1
2422 2018-12-19 20:15:20 Over a decade my battle, I refuse to let it beat me. Came off all prescribed depression meds, and just take cannabis oil once a day - works for me.
2423 2018-12-19 20:15:20 Is it your vegetable oil?
2424 2018-12-19 20:15:16 As a president and minister for oil. What has he done? He should probe himself first
2425 2018-12-19 20:15:06 Then He will give the rain for your land in its season,the early rain and the later rain,you will gather in your grain,your wine,and your oil;
2426 2018-12-19 20:14:43 I'm thinking about making a hair growth oil  not many people know this about me, but I have trichotillomania. If you have it also, I really want to make something to help. Even if you don't have it, it will help stimulate hair growth 
#hair #hairgrowth #trichotillomania
2427 2018-12-19 20:14:36 Easy: Vladmir told the orange clown to do it. Russia demands a bigger presence in partnership with Iran/maybe Turkey (both currently not very friendly to the US) Syria gives access to the Med from the Caspian Sea thru Iran/Iraq: OIL 
2428 2018-12-19 20:14:34 Olive oil.
2429 2018-12-19 20:14:16 Joints just aren't as supple as they once were.  Like molasses with air trapped in it, or very cold oil, the cartilage becomes less able to flex and move, and slowly wears away.  Here comes arthritis 
2430 2018-12-19 20:14:05 At the very least the 17 years of endless wars & deployments MUST be paid by others & not the select few who volunteered thinking they'd be deployed for winnable actionable threats to US freedom, not oil politics & civil wars
2431 2018-12-19 20:14:04 May's WA is 'not' Brexit.
No Deal is the public's favoured option. 
Don't bottle it. 
If you listen to H & J who have always been Remainers, their snake oil salesman pitch will have you.
2432 2018-12-19 20:14:02 No, Bush41 made his fortune in oil when he moved the family to Texas after the war.
2433 2018-12-19 20:14:00 All this girls that put vegetable oil on their face for it to glow and look smooth...please oil is cost now. Wait till after Christmas and New Year.
2434 2018-12-19 20:13:51 Get Powell off the TV. He’s killing my year end balance sheet & #Christmas2018  longer he talks lower markets go. Bad decision #RateHike oil prices low, retail numbers up, joblessness at 40 year low, He keeps saying health economy. Why #RateIncrease then?
2435 2018-12-19 20:13:40 All they do is check the oil and shit too lol
2436 2018-12-19 20:13:38 The largest oil producer is the US.
2437 2018-12-19 20:13:38 YES !! they understand without Scotland wealth they would struggle . they were bankrupt in the 60s 70s  the the oil came ....
2438 2018-12-19 20:13:37 None, unlike the Norwegian government owned oil company that has made them one of the richest countries in the world. We got Westminster and nuclear bombs instead.
2439 2018-12-19 20:13:37 Yeah it’s like an oil
2440 2018-12-19 20:13:32 Assad wouldn't have any interest at this juncture ... there won't be any offers...might even be prepared to loose Qashimlo...SAA will mostly be trying to recapture oil fields further south...happy to leave Turkey there for now...
2441 2018-12-19 20:13:29 I can’t do all that oil on the lemon pepper wet
2442 2018-12-19 20:13:23 The worst kind of drivers have a Prius. Get the fuck out of my way. No one cares that your car runs on peace, love and patchouli oil.
2443 2018-12-19 20:13:20 Sophie is 18.5 y/o. We adopted her from a kill shelter 2 1/5 years ago. We await for bloodwork results to get a course of action. I put her on CBD oil, as she had other pain. It was a miracle for her.  Tess's symptoms are the same. Hugs to Tess!
2444 2018-12-19 20:13:16 I'd settle for the lies to be removed from this piece. And unfortunately everyone, including the NDP, has decided the lies are true. 

Ottawa has no power to cut global overproduction of oil.

Pipelines are not operating at capacity. See "air barrels".
2445 2018-12-19 20:13:09 I know it is. It’s in oil magazines and business articles. Everybody that can read can see it. Reading, try it some time.
2446 2018-12-19 20:13:07 At the car lot getting a oil change and my car smell like big gas 
2447 2018-12-19 20:13:06 Why is it so easy to spend $30 for a meal but not easy to spend that for an oil change  that’s something I need to work on in 2019 lol
2448 2018-12-19 20:12:52 Comrade #Trump’s MAGA deeds for master #Putin:

2449 2018-12-19 20:12:51 Ya, that's something I can stand behind. Saves Canadian jobs now and in the future. You'd rather we kill Canadian jobs and continue importing Saudi oil?
2450 2018-12-19 20:12:35 You mean in terms of supporting a club that hasn’t been ploughed with oil money? Your stadium is called the Etihad? Are you not embarrassed by that? City fans go on about being the ‘family’ club and it’s laughable. You’re so obsessed with United it’s hilarious.
2451 2018-12-19 20:12:35 Major score last night!!!! An original oil painting of a Canadian Pacific freighter in winter.  Magnificent details, gorgeous frame.  Artist:  Ron Tremblay 1991.
2452 2018-12-19 20:12:31 That’s giving them too much credit. Oil today is at $47/barrel
2453 2018-12-19 20:12:16 A meal in 20 minutes! Baguette toasted with olive oil and parmiagiana cheese. Serve with baked omelette.
2454 2018-12-19 20:12:11 The Earth's core naturally produces oil.
2455 2018-12-19 20:12:05 All the more reason to embrace renewable energy and safe(er) fracking.  We can buy oil from Canada.  But let's get off the Jihad Juice and be energy independent so we don't have to rely on these folks.   For the record, I own a Tesla Model 3 because I seriously believe in this.
2456 2018-12-19 20:11:59 I guess you have not read that Bahrain has found more oil than Saudi Arabia which has enough oil reserves for the next 100+ years
2457 2018-12-19 20:11:57 It was a worldwide crisis. And all investments were affected, not just oil. Stop spinning lies. You’re boring me and I have Christmas to prepare for my kids.
2458 2018-12-19 20:11:50 sometimes when im cooking by myself ill say random instructions w authority like I’m Gordon Ramsay like potato’s, oven, 220, olive oil, cunt
2459 2018-12-19 20:11:34 I hope it is the bottom... Do something about it !!!
Trump is responsible as well probably even more (trade war, oil, messing up with Powell's shit...)
2460 2018-12-19 20:11:28 Today I was told my skin is glowing. Is it that new $37 highlighter or just pre-period overactive oil glands? A girl never tells her beauty secrets.
2461 2018-12-19 20:11:17 oil long and stocks short cancelling out, for now
2462 2018-12-19 20:11:13 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
2463 2018-12-19 20:11:06 Metabolically health with high LDL over metabolically healthy with high seed oil intake.
2464 2018-12-19 20:11:04 Don't leave out the oil pipeline to Europe that everyone wants to control. All the poor rich bastards are gonna need some gofundme pages.
2465 2018-12-19 20:10:56 i like to put baste it w olive oil + nutritional yeast and then broil it for a few minutes.
2466 2018-12-19 20:10:51 my oil mix  it’s coming soon
2467 2018-12-19 20:10:39 Reminds me of a scene from the Steve Martin movie, The Jerk. A deranged killer selected Martin at random from the phone book & is firing a sniper rifle at Martin, at his job at a gas station. Bullets miss Martin strike & some oil cans. Martin screams “he hates these oil cans”.
2468 2018-12-19 20:10:37 I watched the bust in the 80s, and decided that I would not work in Oil sector.
2469 2018-12-19 20:10:20 Raat mein protein n salad khaen... Roti rice and oil n sweet bilkul b mat lein
2470 2018-12-19 20:10:20 As he puts on his evil face of intentions. Of course! His agenda is Israel’s oil!
2471 2018-12-19 20:10:20 Yes. Free market. Let’s buy oil from a country that’s industry has little to no enviro regs to follow and who’s human rights history is disturbing, rather than buy it from our own country, which is exceptional in both areas. Oh, and coast protectors? #BeatIt
2472 2018-12-19 20:10:16 $spx $spxl $spy $wtiu changed course again - Booked almost 5% profit on $wtiu from yesterday’s trade and put it all in 3x large cap equity etf. Still like oil but now think risk/reward better in stocks with SPX below 2500.
2473 2018-12-19 20:10:04 Tfw you realize you bought snake oil
2474 2018-12-19 20:10:02 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
2475 2018-12-19 20:09:58 Progress is relative I suppose. It seems to me that AB is struggling as much or more than anytime since the 70’s oil crisis. Perhaps we need less of Notley’s vision of “progress” and more of someone who’ll get serious about making pipelines happen and carbon taxes not happen.
2476 2018-12-19 20:09:35 Should we wonder why not even 1 article on @Tesla by great apologist @girishkuber while he has free time to publish praising editorials on dumb Hindi movies made by retards along with much of overrated "brand" @havellsindia. 

Love of oil or hate for inventions/innovators?
2477 2018-12-19 20:09:32 Remember once this happens huge amounts of oil $ will start to flow to Russia and their US political helpers...
2478 2018-12-19 20:09:06 If you mime ‘stupid people’ in time with Corbyn you will see that it doesn’t fit.

He’s a liar and whoever tries to say otherwise is either lying or brainwashed. Deaf people don’t know what it is like to articulate speech, so they are in no position to certify how it is done.
2479 2018-12-19 20:09:06 Agreed.  It is not well understood the degree to which constant ME strife helped the US & USD system specifically.  I would also expect multi-currency oil pricing to be publicly supported by the Mideast soon.
2480 2018-12-19 20:09:04 If reducing pollution the goal displacing Chinese coal with Canadian LNG should be an objective. Same with stopping diesel tanker transatlantic shipping of Saudi oil. 

Don’t avoid the issue...
2481 2018-12-19 20:09:04 It's probably leadership greed that compels them to trust the most untrustworthy. Their treacherous behaviour in aiding and abetting the theft of oil from the Syrian people shouldn't be quickly forgotten. If they had allied with govt forces the war would have been much shorter.
2482 2018-12-19 20:09:04 edges finally filling back in  idk how act. that Jamaican black castor oil is the truth y’all !!
2483 2018-12-19 20:09:04 Much like today, oil prices were falling in the 1990s. Energy prices can matter more than wages when it comes to inflation.
2484 2018-12-19 20:08:56 It’s not the mechanic doing your oil change. It’s someone you wouldn’t trust to walk your dog. That’s how the “Drain transmission fluid by mistake and double fill the oil” happens.
2485 2018-12-19 20:08:51 Omg this is good. Let me know the cost to produce a barrel of West Texas vs WCI? If u believe that’s why we are where we are right now with our oil, I have oceanfront in Saskatchewan for ya...
2486 2018-12-19 20:08:36 That rare “right in front of the net angle,” takes a while to find. OK it was in and Oil only scored one, did not deserve a point. But they seriously should limit reviews to two minute because sooo boring.
2487 2018-12-19 20:08:36 Trying to get my car to go the speed limit up a mountain road is like trying to push a boulder up a slip n’ slide covered in baby oil

2490 2018-12-19 20:08:32 @MadMoneyOnCNBC love your take on things overall, would love to know if you think the increase in use of renewable energy and EVs might be a primary reason for bear market in oil trading?
2491 2018-12-19 20:08:26 As to the product you reference, it’s a caffeine shot. “Snake oil” is a tremendous overstatement. Based on my experience, he’s probably tried it and liked it. And the only people who would hold it against him aren’t significant constituents of his content.
2492 2018-12-19 20:08:21 Bullet bhi ek aur ek hi hai jaan .
Har bullet pe likha marne wale ka naam @ Washington @ RupertMurdoch  
@ SheldonVegas @ KochBrothers @ Oil lobby @ Pharma lobby
2493 2018-12-19 20:08:19 Yeah, I also expect a few political events to affect markets. At least on the energy side, oil prices are gonna crash again.

2496 2018-12-19 20:08:04 Ask Mike O’Cain, Logan, and Bobby Bowden about Mack’s class on the recruiting trail. He is a snake oil salesmen for a reason. I find it poetic that Mack took the time to tweet about it. Mack should be happy twitter wasn’t around his first go round at UNC. Exposed!
2497 2018-12-19 20:08:00 boycott oil and gas,  but that's exceedingly difficult to do
2498 2018-12-19 20:07:58 The purpose was to control oil supplies & ensure usd hegemony for oil pricing. If at least objectives were presented honestly that's one thing.
But anyways, this petrodollar warfare *only* serves DC and military industrial complex and ability for government to run up deficits
2499 2018-12-19 20:07:56 Me: Babes the car needs an oil change & 2 hours.

2500 2018-12-19 20:07:52 I know @politicalham has said that oil co’s like Suncor are operating on a 2036 peak demand timeline. Do you (or perhaps Markham can chip in) know where that date comes from?
2501 2018-12-19 20:07:44 And as I've mentioned before, millions of people have died because of wars over oil and gas, incl the Iraq War. An estimated half million civilians died in that war, which was really about oil,  not terrorism or 9/11. If you are demanding people boycott FB, you also need to
2502 2018-12-19 20:07:42 1/2My quick take: think if they kept Cnd currency they would soon have a hard time dealing with inflation as canadas currency value drops. It would be reasonable to assume the US dollar, as i think it would be less volatile and oil is bought in US $ anyways.
2503 2018-12-19 20:07:39 Trans and oil flush..paid the bills now off to pick up my sisters tv....boy looking kinda nice LaShauna Armstead-Morris i might have to test it out lol
2504 2018-12-19 20:07:38 Amundsen, Scott, and Byrd as rolling in
Friday, and those of bankruptcy had been
of oil and the faded tapestries within,
2505 2018-12-19 20:07:32 FED RAISES RATES again.  They truly want to screw Trump's economy. There was no need to increase rates as the economy has shown signs of slowing, we have low inflation, and $50 a barrel of oil. Clearly The Fed, a private Corp is corrupt. @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods
2506 2018-12-19 20:07:31 Bet your Eddie will be fuming,!

2510 2018-12-19 20:07:10 Should be finding out who is funding the opposition to oil and hit them where it hurts.
2511 2018-12-19 20:07:05 We'll see a fully automated oil industry long before a fully automated McDonald's because oil is easier to automate and the payoff is much higher in O&G because the wages are so high and the profits are so large.
2512 2018-12-19 20:07:04 Then let's go back to the top. If you don't want pipelines then stop using oil...wait you do know the pipelines themselves don't burn fossil fuels right?
2513 2018-12-19 20:07:03 You could drizzle a little oil on leftover cooked pasta so it doesn't stick together when you refrigerate it, but no oil in the water while cooking.
2514 2018-12-19 20:07:01 Also is it dumb to put lemon oil under eyes. Cuz I did and it burned. But I think it's cuz my eczema flare up. Or is it just dumb
2515 2018-12-19 20:07:00 Does US government intend to evacuate all American personnel 
or will few (thousand armed to the teeth) private company contractors be left to supervise the oil delivery?
   
How will the US government support their long term ally (and cannon fodder) YPG against Turkey?
2516 2018-12-19 20:06:57 Toh. It is well.

Dry oil prices shall rise again.
2517 2018-12-19 20:06:54 peppermint oil helps against spiders
2518 2018-12-19 20:06:44 Bet.

Ima try it out and let y’all know. I’m gonna get the oil and the gummies lol.
2519 2018-12-19 20:06:39 Use a lip scrub, then apply olive oil, & after that absorbs use chapstick. If you’re going out into the cold and need a protective shield over your lips, put vaseline ontop so the cold doesnt dry them out.
2520 2018-12-19 20:06:30 Sisi tuliitisha  jebel mzinga DJ akazima ngoma tukaambiwa tuapologise tukiwa juu ya counter alafu probox yetu ikamwagiliwa oil mpaka ndani
2521 2018-12-19 20:06:23 Now to go find some more of that #brownjuice !
Ps. I think it’s liniment oil.
2522 2018-12-19 20:06:23 Let me guess, 98% of climate scientists are morons like AOC, right?  And the 2% funded by oil companies, just like the GOP is funded by oil companies are REAL smart??  Is that your position on #GreenNewDeal?  just guessing, amiright?
2523 2018-12-19 20:06:07 There is a painting in Blue Moon depicting Popeye & Olive Oil in the “Here’s Johnny” scene from the Shining and it may be the greatest piece of American art created and I may need to purchase it.
2524 2018-12-19 20:06:04 I used to have a set of parade lightweights/combats.  It was impossible to get diesel/oil stains out.  Serving with the arty was a nigthmare
2525 2018-12-19 20:06:04 I used anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner, washed my hair once a week, applied tea tree oil and virgin anti dandruff ointment to my scalp every 2-3 days and applied a light cream to my hair
2526 2018-12-19 20:05:55 It’s also not oil. Do some research.
2527 2018-12-19 20:05:46 the oil change dudes always ask me if I want 5 other things that they'd HIGHLY recommend or my car MIGHT explode and they're practically speaking a foreign language and I always say yes and then wonder if they really just charged me $100 for nothing... Because they could have...
2528 2018-12-19 20:05:43 about to just start chugging snake oil
2529 2018-12-19 20:05:34 How about investing $1.6b into training former energy-sector employees to grow cannabis & building more grow facilities in AB instead of throwing it at f'ing oil companies? I am a JT fan, but this is stupid.
2530 2018-12-19 20:05:28 The oil consumption decrease is based on the tax. Are you thick?
2531 2018-12-19 20:05:27 I’m a nervous lip picker and biter, so I do a coconut oil & brown sugar lip scrub to get all the dead skin off, which keeps me from picking it. I also do honey lip masks sometimes and cover it in cellophane while it sits. Glossier balm dot calm is also the best!
2532 2018-12-19 20:05:22 if plastic is oil based,why can it not be burned?
2533 2018-12-19 20:05:21 Maybe, more specifically, the oil industry in Alberta!
2534 2018-12-19 20:05:17 The statement was about ISIS *in Syria*. Obviously Islamic fundamentalism doesn't begin or end with ISIS, and SA leadership was major player in 9/11 funding. None of that matters to Trump or neocons, so long as they keep SA brotherhood happy and the oil keeps flowing.
2535 2018-12-19 20:05:17 Low oil helps Main Street
2536 2018-12-19 20:05:11 we get a lot of Saudi oil. Doesnt matter if its Atlantic Canada or Quebec or Ontario. Atlantic Canada should be getting oil from Nfld off shore if possible
2537 2018-12-19 20:05:02 Of the oil, lol
2538 2018-12-19 20:04:59 Crude oil crushing rn
2539 2018-12-19 20:04:54 Putin positioning himself for major oil/fuel grab. Taking over Syria assures port. Wonder if Assad will fall out of a window?
2540 2018-12-19 20:04:44 Getting back my sense of smell gradually is normally exciting!!! In the past month I got back cologne, peanut oil, incense and candles!
....today I got back human feces.... :(
2541 2018-12-19 20:04:42 I showed this to my little brother he said that will Smith looks like a burned chicken nugget (we’re not racist ok idk why he thinks like this) by the way queen can you react to am I a girl? Poppy turn of the light vol.1 Kim Petras Sophie oil of every pearl un-insides? Pleaaaasse
2542 2018-12-19 20:04:34 Sana oil
2543 2018-12-19 20:04:29 Eu vi o Oil Man na rua e ele estava sem óleo pelo corpo e com roupa
2544 2018-12-19 20:04:29 God that Baba look na die
2545 2018-12-19 20:04:23 There is no greater summer dish than a grilled halloumi sandwich with ripe summer tomatoes and just a bit of olive oil and white balsamic vinegar.
2546 2018-12-19 20:04:14 
2547 2018-12-19 20:04:03 referring to all fully-starch-encased foods as "calzones" is definitely ethnically insensitive. Italians just stole samosa food design, threw some olive oil on it, and called it their own.
2548 2018-12-19 20:04:00 Can wait for the new year to start trying to get this oil money 
2549 2018-12-19 20:03:56 Jeesuz - read the tweet. The problem of getting over land to Canada doesn’t get easier if you are independent. That was my point. I wasn’t making a judgment on if it should or shouldn’t.  I want the oil to move - think we have more chance of that In long-run if we stay united
2550 2018-12-19 20:03:43 how much would you really save$$$$$$$$if you would end your relationship with your partner maar?   

I would save R1800 on petrol for dropping her @ work everyday 

Save +or - R2000 on groceries ( fuck olive oil)

Weekends? don't even wanna say anything about weekends
2551 2018-12-19 20:03:42 Nope. You need to go some research. Oil and gas pipelines leak less than the basics spills when fueling your car.
2552 2018-12-19 20:03:29 I never put oil in my basgettios
2553 2018-12-19 20:03:26 Use products w lots of moisture to make sure the curls are not frizzy! A cream styler put in wet and then let dry natural or use diffuser, then finish with a light oil or more of a cream depending on ur hairs texture/wave pattern and desired result!!
2554 2018-12-19 20:03:19 Will @JustinTrudeau  tell investors  that  he and his Liberal party are committed  to Alberta's  oil and pipelines, I  read that investors  are shying away from Alberta, this will be a huge for 2019 election, @realDonaldTrump #QAnon
2555 2018-12-19 20:03:14 @TheCBDhub @oil_cbd @cbdbug The first rule of Medical CBD club is not talking about the medical benefits of CBD club. No Benefits people, None at all..
2556 2018-12-19 20:03:08 I love the feeling of peppermint oil on my scalp... all tingly
2557 2018-12-19 20:03:07 Makes zero sense, more Snake Oil for the base
2558 2018-12-19 20:03:04 This is just a preview of what will happen next year! The money that Alberta will recieve from the Liberals is a drop in the bucket compared to what Alberta could be making if we could get oil to a refinery and export it. #Bandaidsolution.
2559 2018-12-19 20:03:02 I can wash and oil my hair and scalp and when my hair dries so does my scalp and it makes me feel gross
2560 2018-12-19 20:02:58 It's widely accepted that you heavily salt the water and you shouldn't put oil in the water because it it's a waste of oil and could prevent sauce from absorbing. Maybe some good oil to finish but not during cooking
2561 2018-12-19 20:02:56 ...still be importing their oil from KSA, so what would have been the point of the pipeline anyway? We live in a capitalist country; can't force a business to buy local unless we turn into a dictatorship.
2562 2018-12-19 20:02:49 ハァッハァッレポートようやく終わりが見えてきた、、
2563 2018-12-19 20:02:48 Don't you have some Snake Oil to sell?
2564 2018-12-19 20:02:43 2008? Remember the Great Recession. I do. Remember all the investors that sat tight on their money? I do. Try again. 

Investors are returning to US because they’re producing oil like it’s going out of style. Cause it is. Shale oil ring a bell?

2566 2018-12-19 20:02:39 But you forget to highlight that in Gej regime barrel of oil was sold 120dollars per barrel yet no savings and still have debt ... What is your take here which one is better off selling oil at its lowest price yet doing much ... You have no claim here ..
2567 2018-12-19 20:02:38 All of the oil companies have made those kinds of announcements.
Rigs requiring 30 people to run 5 years ago are now down to 2.
2568 2018-12-19 20:02:25 Lool just trying to know why boss left oil and gas to  be a  social media influencers
2569 2018-12-19 20:02:19 We have no business in Syria and no business doing regime changes for oil fields in that country.
2570 2018-12-19 20:02:18 ไรวะแต่ละเรื่องที่ดู
2571 2018-12-19 20:02:17 We don't have inflation. Oil prices are low which takes inflationary pressure off across the board since oil affects every corner of our society. Wages are finally rising  after too many years of being stagnant
2572 2018-12-19 20:02:16 "Don't drop that oil upon the blankets, now."
2573 2018-12-19 20:02:08 As long as you are comparing, Texas is a Toxic Mess, due to big oil & gas (now) unchecked pollution.
Republican policies spit on the Earth.
It is easier to be poor in Texas than in California...
2574 2018-12-19 20:02:04 Background check, visit my bestie, oil change, car wash, park, and picnic with my little man. He made his own sandwich. Such a nice day.
2575 2018-12-19 20:02:02 อะเรื่องนี้พระนางคือไม่ได้ลงเอยกันแต่พวกนางจะเป็นแค่best friend ถูกมะ
2576 2018-12-19 20:01:56 I'm gonna tell my imaginary babe to use engine oil... Who else thinks it is lit?
2577 2018-12-19 20:01:51 And not once did he explain how he thinks not buying oil from Canada will lower oil consumption. Oil is still coming in. People are still using it. They are just using some one else's oil.
2578 2018-12-19 20:01:46 No, an oil barrel won't explode with a match. Otherwise cleaning up oil spills wouldn't be so bloody difficult. Liquid oil isn't flammable; only as a gas.
2579 2018-12-19 20:01:34 Okay listen up folks. Alberta does NOT have an oil crisis. We have an anti-oil Prime Minister crisis. @CTVNews #canpoli
2580 2018-12-19 20:01:28 Can someone please explain to me these "strategic goals" in the Middle East aside from forcing Christian ideologies on the region? I literally can't think of anything else. The US government can't even claim oil as a reason anymore. They're running out and we have too much.
2581 2018-12-19 20:01:20 Lebanese dish: red beans in olive oil.
2582 2018-12-19 20:01:16 Chai!! You're missing alot.
You prolly don't like it cos it was made with too much oil and not enough pepper/sauce in the egg
2583 2018-12-19 20:01:10 Sorry you are from US you have just legalised hemp there so stop bothering with oil it is finished
2584 2018-12-19 20:01:09 @elonmusk electric cars don't take gas cuz you charge them to go is that correct? What about oil and antifreeze?
2585 2018-12-19 20:01:03 Russian oil co?
2586 2018-12-19 20:01:01 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.
2587 2018-12-19 20:00:56 Wow ... "the court security locked down an entire floor of the federal courthouse in DC for it"

I'm thinking oil pipeline might have something to do with this ...
2588 2018-12-19 20:00:50 Me too I'm in Angus as well atb
2589 2018-12-19 20:00:46 And then we have @BetoORourke, who accepts more corporate campaign contributions from the oil/gas industry than any other politician - except @tedcruz. How are you going to work for the #GreenNewDeal with that albatross hanging around your neck?
2590 2018-12-19 20:00:41 Wages barely rising with full employment.  Inflation under 2% and oil has fallen $30/barrel. Forward estimates being cut. Trade war not over. Why raise rates at all?  Isn’t the $50 billion/month in quantitative tightening removing liquidity? Sorry, Jim. They know nothing! Timber!
2591 2018-12-19 20:00:40 RT @LS_Nutrition: Remind #patients this December: #Safflower Oil #supplements can interact with #Anticoagulants and other drugs.
2592 2018-12-19 20:00:37 2 bottles of annoiting oil then
2593 2018-12-19 20:00:35 I just seen a white lady take a pull put of a oil pen wit her jacket over her face like if it was the worst thing she ever did in the world

2596 2018-12-19 20:00:25 But there's no alternative to the insurance industry. Fossil fuels do have alternatives. Oil companies that keep productivity up via layoffs risk reduced output over the long term.
2597 2018-12-19 20:00:22 I don't understand. Can you someone please explain why they don't just build refineries on the brown field sites at the source of this oil to add value to the product & for the good paying jobs & then ship it out?
2598 2018-12-19 20:00:18 She probably thinks he’s being too nice to the immigrants.  She probably wants a wall so we can pour hot oil on their heads.
2599 2018-12-19 20:00:11 Fish oil boy
2600 2018-12-19 20:00:10 It's even more frustrating because most of the country supports the oil and gas industry. But it's the loudest ones that we hear the most from...
2601 2018-12-19 20:00:06 Yes go get that oil change you’ve been putting off
2602 2018-12-19 20:00:06 Short sellers raiding the oil market once again as the stock markets plunge. This will only work for so long. The oil market is its own market and is heading towards a deficit. Good luck to the speculators, they will be crushed.
2603 2018-12-19 20:00:02 I don’ think that half of them in the Westminster bubble realise how low their stock has fallen with the electorate - I have never felt so much anger and contempt for them. Estate agents and snake oil salesmen would be rated as more reputable. It’s a shame for the decent few MPs.
2604 2018-12-19 19:59:53 Most profits of oil sands went to Fossil fuel corporations, they bagged TRILLIONS of $$. How are they helping ?? Why don’t bring them into equation
2605 2018-12-19 19:59:52 The Liberals have done far more to date to build pipelines than the CPC ever did while in office for two terms... what are you complaining about?...oh right, the Americans no longer want your oil. #abpoli #cdnpoli
2606 2018-12-19 19:59:48 stocks down, gold down, silver down, oil and copper down,  dollar not particularly strong.... where is the money flowing? into Euros?
2607 2018-12-19 19:59:41 Worth it to wait 1.5 hours to pay 36$ for an oil change. Also got some gossip too 
2608 2018-12-19 19:59:20 But even if that were true, wouldn’t you want the oil production with the highest environmental standards be used world wide? Or would you rather the world used oil from countries who don’t give two shits about the environment?
2609 2018-12-19 19:59:12 Definitely don't just peel and slab on a load of oil and put them in the oven!
Just a tip!
2610 2018-12-19 19:59:07 I always work on my own stuff, hardly let anyone touch a vehicle of mine, but I take my truck in for a free oil change and you try to charge me $800 to replace 2 upper ball joints that aren’t even bad on a truck with less than 50k miles you’re a BIG joke
2611 2018-12-19 19:58:56 War keeps the world (and oil and trafficking) moving.
2612 2018-12-19 19:58:52 She works on the NHS. I don't. I work in the construction industry/oil & gas. In 2012 during the construction crises I have been offer a couple of jobs. In the UAE and the other on Brazil. While I was deciding were to go, she was offered a job in the UK and convinced me to come
2613 2018-12-19 19:58:52 Have also seen legislators that are lawyers that represent big oil / gas presents bill that allow oil and gas to pollute and not clean up
2614 2018-12-19 19:58:41 does anyone know if it's dangerous to set dried oil paint on fire. same thing for dried copic and acrylic
2615 2018-12-19 19:58:39 Ams oil, Amway, and Avon. 
My mom and dad!
2616 2018-12-19 19:58:31 U.S. oil futures finish higher as January contract expires
2617 2018-12-19 19:58:18 It's not about "oil free," it's about increasingly tough market conditions that are beyond any politician to address.
2618 2018-12-19 19:58:05 Nothing like pure aloe juice tho  and it’s cheap . I mix mine with olive oil and this Brazilian nut oil I use for my hair. My hair was sooo dry and I sprayed that throughout and finger detangled.. my hair is completely dry now but still looks wet and moisturized
2619 2018-12-19 19:57:54 If you want to guarantee that we will never get Alberta oil to tidewater, try separation. #CivicsIsHard
2620 2018-12-19 19:57:44 Land Rovers suck. Buy one if you like spending time with talking to your mechanic and spending thousands on simple things like an oil change.
2621 2018-12-19 19:57:38 Was telling my sister how i had hot cooking oil splash on me and then had boiling water splash on me just a hour after....Her response was "But you dont got hot girls splashing on you".... -_-What does that even mean?!?!?!
2622 2018-12-19 19:57:37 Let me make a post on the very first episode of “Daily Escapades of Alexa”
I am at the dealership waiting for my oil change, and there are two other people in the waiting room. A father and his son. Little kid is sacked out sleeping in the seat. Cute...BUT
2623 2018-12-19 19:57:36 Lessons learned: 
Fight ISIS like the Kurds did = get thrown under the bus. 

Do as Turkey and hep create and then support ISIS, a terror org massacring Western citizens = get rewarded with oil rich lands and appeasement. 

This will haunt US foreign policy for decades.
2624 2018-12-19 19:57:34 Without oil & gas what will fuel the millions of trucks, busses, cars & planes that crisscross the nation & world daily? Until there is adequate alternative energy to do so, punishing oil & gas companies & their employees by extorting them is irresponsible!
2625 2018-12-19 19:57:27 Seen the 19.99 for basic oil change , bitch ass car need synthetic oil lol from the 20$ to the 50$ real quick 
2626 2018-12-19 19:57:25 Shoutout to Walmart TLE for washing my window during my oil change. It was filthy, hard to see out of, and totally not representative of my mental state.
2627 2018-12-19 19:57:22 You can't slick a can of oil baby
2628 2018-12-19 19:57:20 We need a law that requires Legislators  to Recuse themselves, I have seen bills that allow abandon oil/ gas wells , and he is a big oilman
2629 2018-12-19 19:57:08 He broke his promise to refuse oil executive money, was removed from the list of people who made that promise,  and voted in the House to export oil abroad.

2631 2018-12-19 19:56:49 'Unai Emery's cup record is frightening'. Managing a team in France who are backed by an oil state will do that.
2632 2018-12-19 19:56:30 These days our very leaders bring it to us. Gadaffi asked all African countries to join together and instead of being paid in dollars for the oil, they should pay us in gold. Hooooo and the dog ate the coffee!!
2633 2018-12-19 19:56:21 Lets play in Lucas oil before we start playing with fire
2634 2018-12-19 19:56:16 why do they call olive juice olive oil 
but call my juice cung
2635 2018-12-19 19:56:11 Not bothered about Oil then?
2636 2018-12-19 19:56:08 All I want right now is Dan wake with palm oil 
2637 2018-12-19 19:55:57 I finally put air in my tires, now if only I can make myself go get an oil change before my car explodes..
2638 2018-12-19 19:55:50 It's a proxy war over an oil pipeline that had "hidden" consequences which will be externalized to victims and taxpayers. The same story it always is.
2639 2018-12-19 19:55:48 Oh, yes there's stock in there. Some olive oil, soy sauce, bay leaves, mixed herbs and probably smoked paprika too.
2640 2018-12-19 19:55:47 me & you bitches are OIL & WATER! we don’t mix 
2641 2018-12-19 19:55:47 it's very important to me though, so when a vendor says, "we do OT" and it turns out to be snake oil it pisses me off.
2642 2018-12-19 19:55:44 International market mein 70% Crude Oil price reduce hogai aur feku govt ne petroleum products ki prices reduce karne k bajai 10_20 % increase kiya.. ye kaun bataiga
2643 2018-12-19 19:55:41 look, turns out oil heavy foods tend to retain heat way better than other foods >_>
2644 2018-12-19 19:55:34 I'm not sure if the cats like it when I put coconut oil on them
2645 2018-12-19 19:55:26 We have one. Hoping to avoid using it bc I basically have to declare WWIII to get my husband to clean it up afterward & dispose of the oil. I’d love to get rid of it if possible.
2646 2018-12-19 19:55:17 He can always change the family business to importing olive oil like another Don.
2647 2018-12-19 19:55:03 Hennessy tastes like motor oil!
2648 2018-12-19 19:55:03 It's always been about the oil. Syria is a strategic port point for Russia's pipeline oil. Remember when they planted a titanium flag under the North Pole claiming all Arctic oil belonged to Russia? Arming Erdogan with patriot missiles, too? Ay yi yi
2649 2018-12-19 19:55:01 Burgum received more than $1.8 million in campaign contributions from mostly oil executives! Remember saying that would be a conflict of interest? Let’s see who would I side with the people of ND or my donors?? Drop dapl charges! Return land under lake! Do the right thing
2650 2018-12-19 19:54:26 Please add some Pioppian coconut oil to that.
2651 2018-12-19 19:54:25 Kemi oil n white amber 
2652 2018-12-19 19:54:15 Thomas is trying to say, Oil money was hit so hard under previous govt (Conservatives) that the money left town...not even close
2653 2018-12-19 19:54:11 It is not about diverting from FBI investigation. It is about helping Putin to gain control over the Syrian oil fields and to do whatever he wants in Syria
2654 2018-12-19 19:54:09 Syria : Mid East : keeping the US out of another costly Middle East war is perhaps the one issue @realDonaldTrump has shown consistency on. It may be due to his talk w/ Erdogan but even that's a positive: he listens to a local leader instead of Israel or our fat oil/arms lobbies
2655 2018-12-19 19:54:07 Be rubbing engine oil
2656 2018-12-19 19:53:59 i’m glad that you said that! I have some extra virgin olive oil for trev. seems like he needs it #riseabovehate
2657 2018-12-19 19:53:50 Just thinking:  today on wiki, while looking up how Canada and Alberta can diversity their industry and improve how we use  oil and gas, they asked:  will you donate to wiki and do you think knowledge is free.  The answers:  yes and yes.
2658 2018-12-19 19:53:28 Been Dragging On this Cannabis~Oil AllDay ive Been About Baked.
2659 2018-12-19 19:53:28 This is the hardest part, now that we know when he is leaving. Impossible to do anything but sit and wait. I’m letting him have alone time in his garden. We did use cannabis oil, which I think has made him drowsy.
2660 2018-12-19 19:53:26 It’s 100% about the Lobbyist Cartel. They’re bi-partisan & hate trump cause he can’t be bought. The Space Force formation was Trumps attempt to prevent these elites from hoarding life changing tech from Joe&Jill Citizen & keeping Big Oil/Power as needed Industries #FullDisclosure
2661 2018-12-19 19:53:24 so sad bc I came to Audi for an oil change and now my water pump has to be replaced and they are keeping my car 
2662 2018-12-19 19:53:18 Yes...bring troops home and let Dick Cheney and Genie Energy go fight for the oil on thier own.
2663 2018-12-19 19:53:07 Fats micro nutrient is what responsibile for hormones (testosterone) production mostly in males...Your Peanuts, Avocados, olive oil
2664 2018-12-19 19:53:02 Exactly, just imagine the literal shitstorm that would happen if suddenly no more fuel, oil, propane and whatever else the trucks haul just stopped, 3 days max would see a lot of these half wits shitting their pants

#AskQuestions
2666 2018-12-19 19:52:47 Fact is that GEJ would have won only in Otuoke if the Election had been held in 2016. He was borrowing to pay salaries when crude oil price was above $60. 
As for agent's deeds, don't you blame PMB for the actions of his appointees?
2667 2018-12-19 19:52:45 Just like the vintage figure so like patchouli oil lol.
2668 2018-12-19 19:52:44 Then why did Flynn lie about it? Why was he forced to go back and reg #FARA for Turkey back to 8/16? Why did Ekim Alptekin lie about his Ratio Oil connects and deal with Flynn? Why did Ratio lie about it, claiming the LOI was forged? Facts are stubborn things.
2669 2018-12-19 19:52:41 what do you mean?  that killed his kiss and put them in trash bags in an oil drum....he should not be breathing
2670 2018-12-19 19:52:32 “ABs oil patch is perhaps”....what part do u not understand? Go look at how well the Patch did from 2007 until 2015. It wouldn’t take 12 years to hit Oil companies to pack up and leave. Nice try...
2671 2018-12-19 19:52:32 Hi Gemma! Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com to share your thoughts. They can get more information and  provide assistance.
2672 2018-12-19 19:52:31 How does one know? Meaning how does a person know where their oil comes from.
2673 2018-12-19 19:52:29 Do u think it holds, and do u think oil starts another legg down from here?
2674 2018-12-19 19:52:27 And you really don’t deserve me at my avocado oil
2675 2018-12-19 19:52:11 The people of Quebec may want Alberta oil yet they don’t force their govt to buy it so ..
2676 2018-12-19 19:52:01 We barely even use sauce.. just a swipe of oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella mostly lolol.. green peppers or spinach if I'm feeling fancy..  basically just gimme the bread and cheese.
2677 2018-12-19 19:51:53 I’m sorry about the pain. Usually, I use Doterra clove oil and it worked wonders to stop the pain! Big time.
2678 2018-12-19 19:51:50 Hypothetical: Let's say Vancouver says more violent wind storms caused damage. Then they go to court and judge rules that violent wind storms have gone down with climate change. Then what happens, the oil industry demand Vancouver pay for the added benefits of less wind?
2679 2018-12-19 19:51:42 Dipika ji India main oil ka Sam bar Gaya hain.sree Ko itna bhi faltu ka oil mat kijiye
2680 2018-12-19 19:51:41 Mane i have a lot of hair & i need someone to oil my scalp today 
2681 2018-12-19 19:51:37 Im just re listening to the interview and I can only hear positives. Of course, things could go wrong but I only ever think positive and really look forward to next year now with my ukog sharesys.
2682 2018-12-19 19:51:32 The Kurdish Army has been supporting US Troops for Years and now we are turning our Backs on them? The US Military leaves no man behind because this is a cowardous act of Treason! How much of the Syria Oil Deal with Russia is Trump getting? Traitor Trump!
2683 2018-12-19 19:51:26 Once OPEC cuts begin will the efficiency of the fleet decrease...ie less ME oil heading across to the US means that ships heading West for heavier crudes will be empty...more Ballasting = tighter fleet!?
2684 2018-12-19 19:51:26 Enough innocent Muslims killed in #Syria? Or did they run out of #oil?
2685 2018-12-19 19:51:23 AAAAAAAHHHHHHH I LOVE THIS WITTLE TWUCK!!!! CUTE BABY BOY NEEDS MOTOR OIL FOR HIS TUM TUM TO GROW INTO HIS BIG SIZE!!!
2686 2018-12-19 19:51:22 it's not just oil.  When broad range of commodities all go in the same direction, people have historically associated this with change in economic direction. Unlike stocks and bonds, physical commodities are consumed. When prices are falling, demands/growth must be falling.
2687 2018-12-19 19:51:13 I need to learn how to change my own oil because there is no way I’m going to way someone to do it for the rest of my life.
2688 2018-12-19 19:50:28 Secret, olive oil the muffin before adding sauce and cheese
2689 2018-12-19 19:50:27 No oil in the water. It takes 8-9 minutes, just stay in the kitchen and keep an eye on it and stir frequently to keep from sticking. Take it out just before it's done and finish in the sauce. Oil doesn't let the sauce stick to the pasta properly.
2690 2018-12-19 19:50:12 I think its pretty easy. Their primary export is oil. Oil is priced in US dollars. So they should use US dollars.
2691 2018-12-19 19:49:59 I can not accept that you truly believe that! Dems are for the betterment of all AND especially our Mother earth, which is being raped & abused by money hungry oil tycoons. Money can NOT buy us clean air or clean water. Please search out information from other sources. It's vital
2692 2018-12-19 19:49:58 I thought I needed more collagen because my nails are so weak and my bones pop a lot  maybe I need to buy something to help with the oil in my hair  fix one thing another one breaks lol
2693 2018-12-19 19:49:39 Bout time I changed my oil lol
2694 2018-12-19 19:49:32 Remember when Saudi/Softbank's investment in Uber was sold as them trying to diversify from oil. Why did anyone think this

2704 2018-12-19 19:48:32 Self-serving rationalizations. Doesn't give damn about destruction of a province & lives/livelihood of thousands devastated by his/@Justintrudeau's blind policies
If they were really serious 2 get off oil, they'd lead by example & live in cave, rubbing sticks together 2 keep warm
2705 2018-12-19 19:48:17 It is. Taste like drinking a tablespoon of just straight oil.
2706 2018-12-19 19:48:12 THE END of BRETTON WOODS... Is coming too :-) we will no longer be the oil region police.
2707 2018-12-19 19:48:04 Cut down on the processed oil in foods and their IQ’s will rise.
2708 2018-12-19 19:47:57 And palm oil
2709 2018-12-19 19:47:57 - blessed is he who finishes at least 2 bottles smearing oil on butt cheek whilst the other waits in anticipation.  I'm jealous.
2710 2018-12-19 19:47:52 ISIS can become stronger again when USA leaves. They then will have more money (oil fields in Syria) and power to organise huge terrorist attacks. I do not have an American citizen to remind of the possible consequences of that, do I ?
2711 2018-12-19 19:47:40 Try CBD oil. I haven't felt anxiety or depression once since I started taking CDB capsules almost a month ago. 

It works far better than any pill the doctor can prescribe.
2712 2018-12-19 19:47:40 The forecast may be $73 but I think Govt would have Budgeted based on realities and recent trends. If it turns out that oil prices soar, the extra goes into our excess crude account and supplementary budgets can always be made.

2715 2018-12-19 19:47:26 OOPS  I meant to say check out EZEKIEL 38 and 39 not Isaiah.  Russia, Turkey, Iran, they are the big players, others will join to complete the alliance that will invade Israel and they do it to plunder for spoils....the spoils that they want are the great amounts of oil and gas.
2716 2018-12-19 19:47:26 Alberta oil contains bitumen which requires greater refining. That is why some call it dirty. Pipelines are the safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport it. Which is why we need the trans mountain pipeline.
2717 2018-12-19 19:47:25 Damn servicing my wrangler feels like im back at Bmw getting a oil change for the 5 series thank at least my first 4 services are free 
2718 2018-12-19 19:47:24 Ellwood must be on the Genie Oil payroll along with all the others mentioned in this article.  It’s about time Global elites like Cheney, Murdoch,Rothschild,et al, find a different way to protect their interests.
2719 2018-12-19 19:47:17 I go back to buy the oil, tell whiteboy shit was trippy and to add to it he says tell him “piece of shit white boy” sent you...

2721 2018-12-19 19:46:55 ..would have greased Florence Henderson up w/ some Wesson cooking oil
2722 2018-12-19 19:46:51 I really think it’s because you’re a lying snake oil salesman who totally got out of your “lane”. Was anyone in your orbit telling you now scrutinize you’d be as president, or were they  just looking to profit from the presidency, like you and the Trump Crime Family?

2724 2018-12-19 19:46:34 Revised: Philip Cross: Oil & Gas' popaganda think tank Frasier Institute just exposed how worthless their nonsense is to Canada's economy
2725 2018-12-19 19:46:31 In the interests of peace, why doesn't Syria magnanimously allow Kurdish majority areas of Syria self-determination & a fair share of the oil on their lands, if not sovereignty, recognising the blood they shed in liberating Syria from ISIS?
2726 2018-12-19 19:46:25 Our current heating oil price is at $2.599 per gallon!
(pay within 10 days and get 5 cents off per gallon)
2727 2018-12-19 19:46:24 The one that twists my tits the most (and trust me, that's a lot of tit) is the provinces that pretend like we don't need oil and that they don't use oil, and that we're just dirty oil and bitchers and complainers.

2731 2018-12-19 19:46:00 Tea tree oil may help clear up acne, according to research. Research shows that tea tree oil is equally effective at treating acne lesions as acne treatment benzoyl
peroxide, without the potential negative effects of using antibiotics long-term.
2732 2018-12-19 19:45:45 The guy at the oil change place really wanted to convince me to get all this stuff done. Nah I’m broke, just change my oil.

2737 2018-12-19 19:44:52 Oil and gas stocks showing major strength. Short opportunity?
2738 2018-12-19 19:44:47 If so, Kurds should light the oil wells on fire. We have right to behave like this if they threaten us with genocidals.
2739 2018-12-19 19:44:43 He has gremlins running around the shop with catch pans to keep oil from hitting the floor.
2740 2018-12-19 19:44:41 Well lets hope then that every single oil and gas trucker decides to shut down for a week, there would be some serious change happening then
2741 2018-12-19 19:44:40 I do remember something about ideological curriculum and a Ministry of Proper thought regarding oil and gas, something about a war room too..
2742 2018-12-19 19:44:39 "The whitest and whitest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2743 2018-12-19 19:44:27 Short term, I agree. Yet, that was kind of baked in when the West first decided to intervene. It was always the inevitable outcome because we refuse to get off of oil.
2744 2018-12-19 19:44:22 hahahahaha, like I 've said all along, you are nothing but a Snake Oil Salesman!
2745 2018-12-19 19:44:21 #Syria: Assad regime is celebrating, but their offensive potential remains weak and depends on Iran+Russia. They will aim for the oil fields on the Euphrates and Deir az Zor City first. Much of the rest, all points north= Turkey's for the taking.
2746 2018-12-19 19:44:18 Data are not „the new oil“. Oil is a limited resource, whereas data - in principle - can be reused indefinitely

2748 2018-12-19 19:44:07 I’m actually nervous to take my car in for an oil change bc the guy we go to is so nice and I know I’m way overdue and I don’t wanna disappoint u Garrett I’m sorry :(
2749 2018-12-19 19:44:07 You are incorrect sir. Every Prov manages its own resources. Your HTF was negotiated (poorly) by your Provincial governments. It's made through leases and royalties paid by private oil and gas companies. The $ you're talking about is taxes paid on income, which every Cdn pays
2750 2018-12-19 19:44:04 Yes we have some of the best immigration LAWS in the world, perhaps Justin Trudeau could stick to them, Nice to hear there's been a drop in ILLEGAL asylum seekers, for an oil sand kid, you should know better, don't forget to give the money to Quebec!!
2751 2018-12-19 19:44:02 Long term, probably not. But an oil free industry is still a long ways away.
2752 2018-12-19 19:43:46 CriES my softest dress got an oil stain from instant noodles
2753 2018-12-19 19:43:41 Jesus and Pete’s no oil painting  how rude 
2754 2018-12-19 19:43:37 Add one - a barrel of oil doesn't exist. A "barrel" is 42 U.S. gallons. Those oil drums you see are usually 55 gallons. No one has seen a physical 42 gallon oil barrel for 150 yrs or more.
2755 2018-12-19 19:43:34 Good evening @RadioPaparazi @Sean_RMW @Ellathefourth @eSportsFansClub Murphy #2500 is good enough for me to cook better soup, chicken 1kilo is #1200, pepper  #300, red oil #100, Kerosine #150, Salt #50, Maggie #50. and 3 cups of rice, Christmas food is ready to eat.
2756 2018-12-19 19:43:25 What if we as a society say we’ve had enough and oil industry now is not going to be allowed to put out single use plastic products without a recycling program. I’m tired of all of the reports of it breaking down and getting into our ecosystem which eventually gets into us. Think
2757 2018-12-19 19:43:23 Cant soak up oil if you leave
2758 2018-12-19 19:43:20 a WAR started for OIL on a false premise
stuck for years, lives lost, Nation's priorities put on hold
2759 2018-12-19 19:43:18 Oui, ça serait intéressant de savoir...
2760 2018-12-19 19:43:11 no rust.. lighting. this was right after the water, i usually throw some coconut oil on it after

@lolisa123 I pledge to my heart my comforter, to be patient, abiding and feed you well, for @MamadorNg is the only cooking oil you request for, to serve you with it in excess, so that you can pump blood at a more faster rate, so help me God. Amen. 
2766 2018-12-19 19:42:34 .@jayme_poisson What kind of reporter, following the #IPCC & #COP24, can cover the tar sands and the $1.6b big oil bailout without addressing #climatechange? Very disappointing - and frankly irresponsible journalism @FrontBurnerCBC
2767 2018-12-19 19:42:32 Also intriguing bit about the shale industry being capital intensive. If this is true then oil prices should go up towards the $80 a barrel next year. Wowsers!
2768 2018-12-19 19:42:29 It's a prediction on Brent and in dollars while budget in rials so yes currency has to play a part fed stops tightening dollar begins a fall and oil starting year at 50 projected to average 70 so Rand of 50-80 in constant currency also over supplied this year to estimate so 10.2

2780 2018-12-19 19:41:18 Here's one for the radical urbanists.

Canada is a petro currency.  Without oil, Canada goes bust.  It's more than "just", 100,000 Albertan jobs.

If Canada goes bust, everyone suffers hard. Even the urbanists.

Think critically.

2798 2018-12-19 19:39:37 Last year, the projection was 4 trillion from oil, 2 trillion non oil and the total achieved was 1.7 trillion, that means the remaining over 7 billion for the budget was borrowed?!

You promoted destroying Canada through separation.

I speak the truth - the oil and gas companies, with your “leadership” are committing genocide on the west coast. 

It is fact. We will die if we don’t fix climate change.
You ignore fact, science, reason, life.

2823 2018-12-19 19:36:41 Our HTF is sent to Quebec annually instead of our own bank account. That’s not Alberta’s plan but Ottawa’s. No other oil region is diversifying away from oil anywhere else in the planet. Nor does any other oil region face protests from foreign interests. You are being manipulated

2827 2018-12-19 19:36:27 Patriotic? Is supporting the guy who was selling out the US for Russia and Turkey the new definition of "patriotism"? In the old west, when somebody supported a snake oil salesman that showed up to fleece the town, that person was not really for the town.

2836 2018-12-19 19:35:05 I'm convinced that a not insignificant number of Albertans think that the sitting Premier of any given time literally opens and closes the taps on oil.

1) That's PERSONAL DONATIONS from people employed in the oil & gas industry, one of TX's biggest.

2) Beto ranked high on the list because BETO RAISED A SHIT TON from all sources.

2876 2018-12-19 19:31:22 I really should drink more water. Went to get a massage done and the woman said to me "You don't drink much water do you"? Apparently when she applied the oil on my back my skin absorbed it all right away, and that's not good. She said she used twice the amount on me than usual.

2880 2018-12-19 19:30:53 So hard. Oh wait, our O&G revenue allows Alberta to charge no consumption taxes. Makes polluting a lot cheaper. Even a $1.6 billion account would have been helpful & avoid the handout, if a trillion was too much. Except Alberta produces more oil than Norway. Now whats the excuse?
2881 2018-12-19 19:30:51 My obgyn is the most supportive, liberated woman I’ve ever met. And she is retiring. What am I going to do?? How am I going to find another cute middle aged lady that recommends coconut oil as a natural lubricant and supports my hoeness like that
2882 2018-12-19 19:30:46 I agree! I’ve been asking the same question and get crickets. He has no honor and should be stripped of any titles, medals, honors. Actually he should be boiled in oil, but we don’t do that

2891 2018-12-19 19:30:24 get factual - Modi is paying the 1,70,000 crore oil bill left out by UPA ( of that 40,000 crores paid by last year); Modi is building up critical oil reserves for 3 weeks (two weeks already completed) to run the country in war times. but u compare crude dollars then & now?
2892 2018-12-19 19:30:23 Oil and gas industry needs nobody’s help
2893 2018-12-19 19:30:20 Given the economic uncertainty and the decline in the price of oil, my guess is that had Trump not challenged the independence of the Federal Reserve by calling on the to not raise their rate, the Fed wouldn't have raised their rate this quarter.
2894 2018-12-19 19:30:16 Thanks my darling. I’ve just stopped working, going to run a super hot bath, pour in a load of olbas oil and get myself a hot toddy which may or may not be laced with whiskey or spiced rum... xx
2895 2018-12-19 19:30:15 Oil refineries are worse, I’m sure you know from your time on the gulf coast. In Houston, there’s actually a public number you can call to help identity various industrial/chemical smells.
2896 2018-12-19 19:30:08 แล้วปัญหามันก็เกิดจากข้อความอีกแล้ว...

2898 2018-12-19 19:30:05 330am pro gapamanyos ta ya efficascent oil.
2899 2018-12-19 19:30:01 I recall seeing a map that overlapped the position in Syria of US forces and where oil fields were located.
2900 2018-12-19 19:30:00 #ICYMI: The @USGS identified 46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids in the Wolfcamp Shale and Bone Spring Formation in the #PermianBasin.
2901 2018-12-19 19:29:51 .Water is created inside the Earth--H&O under extreme temp&pressure.There is no water shortage, so elite parasites' attempts 2 transfer us frm oil based economy (we give them $$ every day) to a water based economy (we give them $$ every day) means they hv 2 convince us H2O scarce
2902 2018-12-19 19:29:50 1. KD a snake 2. The troops fighting for oil not freedom 3. Jordan played plumbers
2903 2018-12-19 19:29:37 #Budget2019 : The Debt servicing (which is quite expected) and the crude oil forecast are just my worries.
Shouldn’t we atleast have a realistic dreams.
#NextLevelBudget
2904 2018-12-19 19:29:33 So what if no one wanted to buy our said oil anymore ? Furthermore, and you should think on this, and maybe reread the gospel, but how would Christ respond to “illegal” immigration ? Aren’t we all Gods children ? Or are some luckier than others and in turn deserve a better life?
2905 2018-12-19 19:29:23 It kind of looked like an oil spill fighting 8bit fire
2906 2018-12-19 19:29:18 Oil sells off. No surprises
2907 2018-12-19 19:29:13 Someone doesn't know how to do research. I don't have any options. Maybe too much time inhaling fumes from the oil patch there Grampa paranoia lol! Man you should have staying in school! The ability to connect the dots here are pretty sad.
2908 2018-12-19 19:29:07 The money fighting climate change has been paid for decades by oil companies, whose propaganda on climate denial is the denial we should be investigating. And litigating?
2909 2018-12-19 19:29:07 because he didn't have to work 3 jobs back to back in order to afford the snake oil his culture convinced him would cure the cancer the stress gave him.
2910 2018-12-19 19:28:59 Oh hun, you are being played badly. Last decade was the dream for the oil patch and its workers. Investment was up, wages were up, province was earning money for our social programs. Please review who kneecapped the industry with regulation and taxes...
2911 2018-12-19 19:28:57 Got my CBD oil , will try it when I won’t work in case I don’t like the effects,
2912 2018-12-19 19:28:54 What an assinine thing to say in response to something positive. Goes to show that you don't give a sheite about the oil industry... it's just about being anti-Quebec.
2913 2018-12-19 19:28:36 Nice to see #oil closing near the highs of the day. We should see further upside in the coming days.
2914 2018-12-19 19:28:33 Using either clarified butter or Olive oil you just gently cook the egg by slowly pouring/basting the egg with the hot oil/butter until the yolk cooks through without the whites covering the egg yolk. Pain in the ass. Sometimes I cheat and just cover the pan with another pan.
2915 2018-12-19 19:28:30 Distraction, Distraction, Distraction
Misinformation, Misinformation, Misinformation
DT making claims+taking credit w/draw troops Syria
Plans already do so in sm #, Syria war over OIL+Cruelity there
2916 2018-12-19 19:28:16 Only in the cities.

Out here where the food's actually made, we'll be fine.  We have food, water, oil, and firearms.

We can starve out Toronto and Vancouver.
2917 2018-12-19 19:28:05 The Russians defeated ISIS. Until their intervention ISIS was advancing into Damascus despite years of US bombing, which had miraculously failed to dent ISIS oil transportation. Within a couple of months the Russians had destroyed the lot.
2918 2018-12-19 19:27:54 Moreover, I have called for a drought that will affect the fields, the hill country, the grain, new wine, fresh olive oil, a... Haggai 1:11
2919 2018-12-19 19:27:50 i ate a lot of cookies made with coconut oil, I'm going to smother you in your sleep.
2920 2018-12-19 19:27:50 We all understand the importance of oil and it's by-products. The point is: getting oil to market by overruling the courts, removing environmental safeguards, and ignoring First Nation concerns is not acceptable to the majority of Canadians
2921 2018-12-19 19:27:36 So when Alberta goes Conservative again provincially and they will next election because they are bred Conservative from day one. They will once again find a party with no answers other then hope for higher oil prices.
2922 2018-12-19 19:27:24 That dad ingredient makes it soooper delish! 

My personal fav is just off the pressure cooker boiled potatoes with salted butter, a drop of mustard oil, finely chopped onions and coriander leaves folded into it ... :)
2923 2018-12-19 19:27:20 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2924 2018-12-19 19:27:18 This is the worst policy solution. Paid for by big oil. Ted, I’m severely disappointed in your work.
2925 2018-12-19 19:27:17 How long would it be before Canadians protested having to pay the world market price for their own oil? We are better off selling every drop to foreigners for the exchange. We are leaving oil culture behind...it’s too late for Energy East. #cdnpoli
2926 2018-12-19 19:27:17 @LiciaCorbella .......it about time AB took ownership of oil 'mess, they R in the Gateway nor th pipeline increase  R non starters when 1 considers the shipping waters tankers now 2M BBLs instead of 200K1971 proved tankers could not navigate.....
2927 2018-12-19 19:27:16 Its currently 20% more expensive then current gas prices. People would be willing to pay the extra cost for oil free gas today and thats just the first pilot plant. If you think 20% is an impossible cost to cut your very short sighted
2928 2018-12-19 19:27:12 She goes for a oil and filter change & was told it will be $70 extra to reset the service due light. THATS OUTRAGEOUS AND DEFINITELY PRICE GAUGING . Flow Audi is ripping people off & taking advantage of female customers! Audi should ashamed to be associated w/ Flow Audi
2929 2018-12-19 19:27:05 These essential oil kits are perfect for the budding Essential Oil Enthusiast! And they are on sale too!
2930 2018-12-19 19:27:03 Successive Alberta governments have blown almost all oil royalties. Your province desperately needs competent leadership for once. 

PS, Jason Kenney ain't it.
2931 2018-12-19 19:27:02 Changes to make for our environment,  such as to reduce oil and switch to solar power. We need to keep in mind that climate change is real and we need to solve this problem before it's too late, thank you Sydney for sharing that with us. #Quam3B
2932 2018-12-19 19:26:55 This and never change oil on a moving car.
2933 2018-12-19 19:26:55 Ah. I think I knew that. I was just reading things that didn’t talk about the pyramid so didn’t make the connection. A’s carnet de santé only talks about amount of meat for his age (and oil/butter which I forget about most times ).
2934 2018-12-19 19:26:54 Fuck man I hate Oil Ocean 
2935 2018-12-19 19:26:51 It looks like one of the south Nigeria's village fire caused by natives stealing oil by breaking a pipeline
2936 2018-12-19 19:26:49 this is awesome! (also i love my CBD oil, i've become a person who sleeps through the night!)
2937 2018-12-19 19:26:45 I'm not a fan of bourbon, but I found a coconut oil chocolate chip cookie recipe on that blog that I can't wait to try!
2938 2018-12-19 19:26:22 Noodles
Spinach
Eggs
Shredded Beef
Onions
Chili 
Soy sauce
Olive oil
Salt
Great combination!!!! 
2939 2018-12-19 19:26:11 More glute exercises but also checking out CBD oil for some minor aches. I've got runner quads but the glutes need some work. 
2940 2018-12-19 19:26:06 Jobs are jobs, so that's great, but let's not pretend that these make up for 100,000 high paying jobs in the Oil industry.
2941 2018-12-19 19:25:59 Get some rosehip oil and start putting in on the scabs it will help
2942 2018-12-19 19:25:56 keep your eyes peeled for forthcoming information about my new gacha game. it's really going to put the "pull" in oil pulling!
2943 2018-12-19 19:25:42 I need magnesium oil
2944 2018-12-19 19:25:38 oils! coconut or black castor oil
2945 2018-12-19 19:25:26 Its pathetic.
2946 2018-12-19 19:25:24 I work in the oil fields so I don’t say this lightly but outside of Alberta nobody gives a shit about Oil they should but they don’t if they did we’d have two pipeline east and west by now . 
Also Alberta does not elect Federal Governments Ontario and Quebec do.
2947 2018-12-19 19:25:12 W. Bush promised the Iraqi Oil would pay for the war, BUT they never mention THAT anymore as China bought ALL the Iraqi Oil Rights and China also owns U.s. Oil and other investments in the U.S. So, our American troops are there to protect Chinese interests.  Thats WHY we R there
2948 2018-12-19 19:25:07 Daily #Roundup: #Brent Oil (ICE) Futures'Feb↑+0.5% $56.58.#Copper (Comex) Futures'Mar↑+1.1% $2.6940.#Gold (spot)↓-0.50% $1,243.80. #Bitcoin (CME) Futures'Dec↑+7.5% $3,760.00. Bond #Yields 10Y (change): Italy -17.4 bps, China -3.9 bps. $DXY ↓-0.2% 96.91. US $VIX ↓-7.1% 23.75
2949 2018-12-19 19:25:01 I don’t NEED Dr Bronners, but I would LOVE to support them. Especially because of their partnership with Patagonia and working for regenerative agriculture and reducing bad palm oil production. We ALL need to support these things.
2950 2018-12-19 19:24:57 How about oil rafinery drills they secured against Russians are they be in a safe hands?
2951 2018-12-19 19:24:47 I love it when a plan comes together #ukog 
Great interview today from Uncle Stephen.
2952 2018-12-19 19:24:45 sana oil
2953 2018-12-19 19:24:42 Kalo buat make up waterproof bagus. Gue biasanya pake yang biru buat kulit oil mantul
2954 2018-12-19 19:24:37 Crude is actually higher now than before the announcement; yet Oil stocks lower w/ market
2955 2018-12-19 19:24:32 Adropinol is a must try- 0.17oz of peppermint oil infused w/250mg of THC- 1 drop has 2.5mg- you don't need much :)
2956 2018-12-19 19:24:30 i need to change my oil &get a car wash before it get dark. it be dark by bout 4:45 iont get off til 3. 
2957 2018-12-19 19:24:12 And that is the problem with the American society, they don't have the mentality and the financial culture to prepare for unexpected events. Even here in Saudi Arabia when the oil price dropped, the people started to blame the government for costs and didn't plan for such events
2958 2018-12-19 19:24:10 What else would we have done with all this oil?!
2959 2018-12-19 19:24:07 @LiciaCorbella .. famous AB phrases'let the eastern bastards freeze to death' 'it is OUR OIL keep UR hands off' sure ameliorated REST of CANADA how AB take ownership of the plight their in instead blaming PQ ON BC Maritimes......
2960 2018-12-19 19:24:05 Sour gelato  oil got me sitting right
2961 2018-12-19 19:23:48 Venezuela has more oil. Just having resources doesn’t mean squat. Quebec and NS refuse to frack, for instance.
2962 2018-12-19 19:23:41 I’m pretty high and looking at a map of New Mexico and I’m just spotting all the areas with oil/gas concentrations and I’m thinking of the ancient oceans once here and all the organisms that died and fell to the ocean bed that became the land we now step on wow crazy stuff
2963 2018-12-19 19:23:40 Na whoa oh is it oil drilling?
2964 2018-12-19 19:23:34 You mentioned tanker traffic. Tanker traffic in from Algeria and Saudi Arabia is Ok. Canadian oil out is bad?
2965 2018-12-19 19:23:29 Would i make it home on 15% oil life
2966 2018-12-19 19:23:24 What's up with NW North Dakota?? Low pop. + oil money? Not even mentioned in the article.
2967 2018-12-19 19:23:20 Try oil pens they get me every time and I’m really bad at sleeping too

2969 2018-12-19 19:23:08 Fun Fact: Coconut Oil, is oil extracted from coconuts.

2971 2018-12-19 19:23:04 @LiciaCorbella .......guess the US doesnt need/want our oil (;ack of support of XL)  in fact they now export (U have never heard US refineries scream for tarsand product)  Ft Mac has been OVER producing without market E Can IMPORTS 56% of their oil ??......
2972 2018-12-19 19:22:59 Please use my idea of pouring oil or some greasy substance down the walls of the current border. They will be unable to climb the walls if they are slick. Good & cheap.
2973 2018-12-19 19:22:29 More like "Nexxt-On" till the next big oil crave.
2974 2018-12-19 19:22:26 Let me guess, in Quebec he’ll say to to oil and yes to hydropower. And in Alberta he’ll say yes to oil and no to Quebec welfare payments from western canada.
2975 2018-12-19 19:22:10 got my first oil change and filled up my gas for the first time.. omg i'm growing up
2976 2018-12-19 19:22:08 Are you going to 'take the oil'?
2977 2018-12-19 19:21:59 Lil oil have your lips soft as fff
2978 2018-12-19 19:21:58 Digital Transformation Disrupts Oil and Gas
2979 2018-12-19 19:21:53 Not so fast. We’ll get him here first to get our Alberta oil to market. Lol
2980 2018-12-19 19:21:50 All I need...

2981 2018-12-19 19:21:47 It’s not a company...U.S controls Syrian territory where all their oil fields are. You have google. Find it yourself. .
2982 2018-12-19 19:21:38 @LiciaCorbella  todays oil crisis when in the Cons Gov who under Lougheed/Klein couldnt seen past their noses together with tarsands exec who ALL considered that the golden goose would never end....
2983 2018-12-19 19:21:35 So there is plentiful oil but they can’t sell it?
2984 2018-12-19 19:21:32 Getting this oil changed. They told me they have a new computer to install as well. Under warranty. I can dig it.
2985 2018-12-19 19:21:31 Read all of those articles. None say anything about expropriation. No oil spill in history has affected millions of people’s drinking water. Maybe look at all the pipelines on earth and see what damage they have caused. Look safe to me.

2988 2018-12-19 19:21:12 Do you honestly believe their position in terms of oil transportation infrastructure would improve if they were their own country. It may not be worse, but I can't see it being at all improved.
2989 2018-12-19 19:21:11 You believe the market will buy canadian oil if the global demand decreases? #commonsense is not investing in this no-future industry 2/2 #ableg
2990 2018-12-19 19:20:52 Why arent you talking about the manufacturing sector? Its never been better in AB. I guess it doesn’t play well to your big oil indoctrinated base
2991 2018-12-19 19:20:49 No !!!! Those were the ONLY markers that worked on oil change stickers. Ultra won't write on the plastic stickers and fine is WAY too thick !

2994 2018-12-19 19:20:42 The only US interest was oil
2995 2018-12-19 19:20:39 WHAT I'd spend my vouchers on are probably oil filled heaters for guest roo in case the boiler cannot be repaired in time and, havens forbid, dies a death before the Big Day. Then maybe something for myself too make me feel better.
2996 2018-12-19 19:20:38 OIL. Their 'prices' story never changes
2997 2018-12-19 19:20:38 She goes for a oil/filter change & was told it will be $70 extra to reset the service due light. THATS OUTRAGEOUS & DEFINITELY PRICE GAUGING. Flow Audi is ripping people off & taking advantage of female customers! Audi should ashamed to be associated w/Flow Audi in Greensboro, NC
2998 2018-12-19 19:20:37 I love getting my oil changed just so that immediately after they finish and I’m leaving, the guy can tell me that I need new windshield wipers and new brakes and new tires and a new car basically and I can walk out saying yeah I know and hope I don’t die driving on my way home.
2999 2018-12-19 19:20:22 Wasn't bitumen in those old, single wall rail cars. It was highly flammable bakken fracked oil.
3000 2018-12-19 19:19:41 The NHL owes not just Oil fans, but all hockey fans an explanation 1st. , and an apology second , after the refs are fired.

3005 2018-12-19 19:18:58 Don't hate the player, hate the game. Have some compassion for oil workers who are out of work. It sucks not to have a job. We need to be creating green jobs to help communities transition. Oil jobs are too unstable. #abpoli #ableg #canpoli
3006 2018-12-19 19:18:55 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
3007 2018-12-19 19:18:53 Exactly! There is no inflation now. Look at the price of oil. The Federal Reserve wants us to go into a recession.
3008 2018-12-19 19:18:53 WHO GOT SICK :o?
3009 2018-12-19 19:18:50 Petro byproducts account for 16% of oil consumption. Canadian oil is one of the most expensive oil to produce. 1/2 #ableg
3010 2018-12-19 19:18:49 i’m willing to bet money that this oil change is going to take at least 2 hours
3011 2018-12-19 19:18:44 You're also forgetting Saskatchewan and Newfoundland oil fields.
3012 2018-12-19 19:18:42 It's funny how none of the pro-oil folks are willing to talk about the changing market conditions of the oil industry. Automakers are slowly abandoning internal combustion engines, for instance. Is there really a future for Alberta's expensive, low-quality oil?
3013 2018-12-19 19:18:40 If they were "hard work'n" they would currently be at work, working. Instead they have chosen to take the day off of work and hold an industrial area hostage so that NO ONE can do any work. At least they are supporting the oil industry bu needlessly burning a ton of fuel.
3014 2018-12-19 19:18:27 Block the oil refineries and see BREXIT delivered
3015 2018-12-19 19:18:18 Until u supports this brutal regime who abuse its own citizens and other nationality by killing,raping and imprisoning them that’s what would keep happening. I know cheap/free oil is the factor of ur supports for ‘em but don’t u think human lives and freedom worth more than that?
3016 2018-12-19 19:17:41 Looking for some last minute gifts or stocking stuffers? We have peppermint essential oil, a diffuser, and even an essential oils guidebook still up for grabs! 
Wanting more oil options? Stop by and ask for more info on doTERRA orders!
3017 2018-12-19 19:17:36 Oil and water; wish him well.
3018 2018-12-19 19:17:30 $uso oil is still green in face of strong dollar $DXY
3019 2018-12-19 19:17:09 I love my oil patch brothers and sister!! Would love to see this convoy plug up for blocks all around the provincial building 
3020 2018-12-19 19:17:04 Yes I was the same way the first time I flew with Milo, but especially a short flight like that you should be fine! Calming treats have lavender in them but it’s better to put some lavender oil on a toy. Or even have an item of clothing of yours in there so she feels protected
3021 2018-12-19 19:17:04 Not to mention that the Saudi oil goes to the Irving refinery. You know, the Irvings, Scotty Brison's BFF.
3022 2018-12-19 19:17:01 Pssst it was for oil by the way.
3023 2018-12-19 19:17:00 Is there any hope for oil prices going up soon, or why's bubu projecting $60 for 2019 budget?
3024 2018-12-19 19:16:58 Mentioned in a previous tweet DJT brought preditory lending back. Now that you have borrowed, the FED (a consortium of oil companies) raised interest rates 4 times. That and price hikes on stuff equal less money in your pockets and more in theirs.
3025 2018-12-19 19:16:57 Too early to pull out. Kurds need help and bring Syrian oil to international market.
3026 2018-12-19 19:16:55 Don’t worry. Assad will invade Raqqa and the southern oil producing areas, while Turkey takes northern Syria.

SDF
Rojava
3027 2018-12-19 19:16:52 British Yellow vests need to block oil refineries and not riot, only way to bring about the real leave EUSSR democratic vote majority! If May continues to betray the voters!
3028 2018-12-19 19:16:33 So... what´s exactly wrong with this? Sure, the model could be better, but it looks good enough, I heard some people say he looks like he´s covered in oil, and it doesn´t really look like it, it just looks like the shading of any modern 3d game.
3029 2018-12-19 19:16:32 boss made me drive to the boston waterfront in the middle of the night to pick up a shipment of "olive oil from sicily." a bunch of guys unloaded it into the basement where it sat unsold for months. the next day he tipped me $500 in cash and said it was "between you and me"
3030 2018-12-19 19:16:30 I agree. I wonder why so many compent scientists still use those graphs when we know a lot of them are based on interpolated data. Further; I am stunned about the straw man discussions the same scientists keep going. Like the claims that all sceptics are paid by Big Oil.
3031 2018-12-19 19:16:24 Its jigsimur , castor oil is better.
3032 2018-12-19 19:16:23 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
3033 2018-12-19 19:16:11 Thank you Max! We are tired of Ottawa simultaneously holding our their hands for equalization payments, and kicking out the supports under the oil industry.
3034 2018-12-19 19:16:09 If we only all could delete our tweets like you. Funny is you're the one instigating and my reply is to your childish comments back. Calling the kettle black. No wonder you're stuck in the oil patch, worthless in every other aspect of life! Go delete some more of your posts baby
3035 2018-12-19 19:16:05 Perfect name. Olive Oil.
3036 2018-12-19 19:15:57 Its deflation time, oil at $30
3037 2018-12-19 19:15:43 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using massage oil while they orgasm
3038 2018-12-19 19:15:26 all these hijabi youtubers but not one of them wants to tell me how to stop hair oil from ruining my qamars
3039 2018-12-19 19:15:23 Cooked eggs in oil, worst mistake ever.
3040 2018-12-19 19:15:21 Albertas Oil problems will not go away.There are too many small countries producing more than we do and higher quality .The answer to all of this turmoil is #Cannabis Weed Tourism is MASSIVE in CO Multiple levels of supplier from industrial to small farm NON Restrictive #AbLeg
3041 2018-12-19 19:15:21 Yeah me too. OLL-ive OIL.
3042 2018-12-19 19:15:07 cuticle oil and nail hardener, don’t put anything else on them and just let them grow and breathe

Anything middle East, terror or oil dependent. Not est. enough

3047 2018-12-19 19:14:35 Oil looks like Gary from spongebob
3048 2018-12-19 19:14:30 I restate that Better do it quick with NO WALL Mexicos ill- legal weed will be a lot cheaper on every corner as usual.. The governments high-priced THC oil quickly a thing of the past.
3049 2018-12-19 19:14:29 2019 BULL $DXY + BULL $OIL = THE ultimate financial CRISIS
3050 2018-12-19 19:14:29 I just remembered I’m out or cleansing oil and I don’t want to get up and go to ulta 
3051 2018-12-19 19:14:26 All inflation measures are above 2% in particular core and sticky CPI are nearer 2.5%. CPI is 2.2% AFTER 40% discount in Oil in 2 months. If oil didn't go down, CPI would be 3% right now. Wages are above 3%. Next month oil will not bail CPI out.
3052 2018-12-19 19:14:26 เป็นคนไม่เก่งซักอย่างอ่ะ ขนาดรักษาใครไว้ยังทำไม่ได้เลย
3053 2018-12-19 19:14:20 These guys were never good for us. They had blatantly supported Pak during the Indo-Pak wars. 

No matter the freedom, after the uprising, Iran has been a close friend...right from supporting the Northern Alliance to giving oil to us on generous terms! 

Long live the revolution!
3054 2018-12-19 19:14:10 Nothing to like; here I was thinking I found a middle of the road talker in you 
If I could permanently remove one politician from politics it would be Ted... I see big oil and no cooperation with anyone that didn't vote for him 

He has been interviewed & affirms that

3058 2018-12-19 19:13:14 The weird ones are the fun ones
3059 2018-12-19 19:13:12 They discovered oil underneath tanadice, so thought yous needed some freedom.
3060 2018-12-19 19:13:08 That oil spill Louis duffle .....
3061 2018-12-19 19:12:41 I was a kid. What did all these drivers think the arrow was for? How did ppl not know this yet learn how to drive a car? Didn't whoever taught you to drive show you how to pump gas and check oil and tires?
3062 2018-12-19 19:12:30 Its just one of many fronts for Saudi & Iran proxy wars. It's hottest weapons sale zones more than oil. Its not done yet (I am afraid) when its fully blown between cold war era sides....literally into fist fights...
3063 2018-12-19 19:12:29 Hi Ronnie. Are you putting any oil originals on the site. I would like a stones one. Merry Christmas
3064 2018-12-19 19:12:18 Luckily, there is improved prospects for oil output in 2019.  3% growth is ambitious but not impossible if those conditions hold.
3065 2018-12-19 19:12:18 How about releasing your donors list Jason? I'd like to see how much foreign money you're getting to shill endlessly for the oil companies and nothing else.
3066 2018-12-19 19:12:16 A lunch idea... Salad with arugula, olive oil, smoked ham and sliced lemongrass. Serve with small portion of grilled seitan steak in quality sea-salt.
3067 2018-12-19 19:12:12 Rationale:: Syria is a sovereign country who does not want US military presence on its territory. It did not ask nor does it want the US controlling 1/3 of its territory and oil fields.
 It's quit simple really.. explanation for morons who need an explanation.
3068 2018-12-19 19:12:06 $chk loading up here. Oil due for big reversal. $2.06
3069 2018-12-19 19:12:00 Russia will rule that country and take the oil.  That’s the goal, people.  Read the Bible!
3070 2018-12-19 19:11:59 It’s oil sheen
3071 2018-12-19 19:11:46 Yes to Trump

Middle Class income rises to highest on record
US Cuts $300M in Aid to Pakistan
US Cuts $200M in Aid to Palestinians
Right to Try Drug Bill signed
Food Stamp usage declines for 8 straight months
America is NOW the worlds largest oil producer
3072 2018-12-19 19:11:40 Go for a jog, Cry, med change, write, lavender essential oil bath. Call my doc.  Good luck.  Take care of you.
3073 2018-12-19 19:11:35 i can’t believe they figured out that they could trick us all by taking snake oil & rebranding it as SnakeOil.exe. SOaaS (Snake Oil as a Service)
3074 2018-12-19 19:11:30 "Hey Coach, what supplements should I take?"

1. Sleep
2. Water
3. Real food

"What about protein?"
* see # 3

"What about pre-workout?"
* see # 1, 2 & 3

If you've checked off these 3, then you can consider supplementing with: fish oil, Vitamin D3, & Magnesium
3075 2018-12-19 19:11:29 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3076 2018-12-19 19:11:24 Yeah, this sounds like another bullshit way to funnel oil and gas money to Ivey's political campaign.  Because she's the worst.
3077 2018-12-19 19:11:22 NO OIL
3078 2018-12-19 19:11:22 Thank you  I’m hoping so. I think moisturizing during pregnancy was what did the trick, I made my own butter w/ shea, coconut oil and vitamin e & went a little psycho applying it lol
3079 2018-12-19 19:11:21 I'm gonna blast it with a hairdryer for a bit later then pop it in the freezer!! Maybe greasing the tin with some coconut oil might help it slide out after??
3080 2018-12-19 19:11:18 Plan for a rate hike in Canada first quarter in 2019 for sure, expect another hike in summer around july & if things change & if oil bounces back expect a hike in the fall of 2019. Plan ahead!! The hikes aren't over yet
3081 2018-12-19 19:11:16 Lmao bitch please oil change up to dizate
3082 2018-12-19 19:11:08 & what's with the wild weather coming from yonder way? & The Arctic thaw accelerating? There's oil under that ice. & Probably some viruses modern man lacks antibodies for.
3083 2018-12-19 19:11:01 Sulphurous bitumen is not "oil". Supply and demand curves differ for different hydrocarbon products. #ChannellingLeach
3084 2018-12-19 19:10:54 To destroy ISIS we must find out who is funding them. How can a bunch of fanatics get oil money and heavy armored vehicles? The west won’t like the answer, but this is the only way to rid the world of this dangerous clique. #Changing History eBook on Amazon
3085 2018-12-19 19:10:54 for some people it does. Several of my patients take CBD oil which doesn't get you high. I always recommend people talk to their family doc and pharmacist about potential interactions but always recommend avoiding smoking it!
3086 2018-12-19 19:10:47 Federal Reserve once again proving they're pretty clueless.  Market sells off after being up over 300 points.  Oil down under $50/barrel, global economy slowing down, flattening yield curve, but these dummies still want to hike more after today and next year.
3087 2018-12-19 19:10:45 I very politely replied, “Let me talk to would take the oil is right. America is one of the South China Sea. Is that correct?
3088 2018-12-19 19:10:26 If the market shrank, but the average person ended up with more money because the oil cartel factions just shifted (more spending/saving cash for middle class) would the Federal Reserve (a collection of private banks) find another way to suck money out of the economy?
3089 2018-12-19 19:10:20 You realize the government doesn’t buy oil eh

Roast potatoes Pick the large roast potatoes not the smaller ones when they come your way at the Christmas table. They have a smaller combined surface to soak up oil than smaller ones #HealthyEatingTips

3094 2018-12-19 19:09:45 Foreign reserve from about $20b to, about $40b at the time when oil prices went down. 

Electricity from 4000mw to 7000mw the highest in the history of Nigeria. 

Agricultural transformation. 

Make Nigeria  construction site with roads railway.

Etc.....
3095 2018-12-19 19:09:42 Lib GVT: Hey AB give us 1.6billion   for equalization 

AB: But our industry is failing because of your policies 

Lib GVT: Hey AB here is 1.6billion now arent we great but its for green programs not your oil industry
3096 2018-12-19 19:09:19 Without a doubt. Canada without globally exported oil is a country in trouble. We don’t need any other countries oil if we focus on what needs to be done to refine and distribute nationally as well. Canada could be wealthy. Our carbon footprint doesn’t register comparatively.
3097 2018-12-19 19:09:08 "But kitchen secrets are so much fun, Ollie."

Grins as he heard that he puts too much oil in it. That is actually not that bad. At least nothing is going to end up sticking to the pan.

Lifts his brow as he talked about that lover and sneaking him in.

"That lover better --
3098 2018-12-19 19:08:56 That's going to require reversing the tide of special-interest influence/corruption in DC. The whole town is awash in corporate cash. We still give Big Oil/Coal $20BILLION a year! Even after CEOs flew their private jets to the HILL & testified they DON'T ACTUALLY NEED THEM.
3099 2018-12-19 19:08:55 I’m planning to relocate as soon as they finish decommissioning the oil rig. At least I’ll have a sea view
3100 2018-12-19 19:08:55 With this hike and signals of future hikes, US$ set up to tracking higher=lower exports=lower profits=lower stock prices. Also commodities set up to track lower. Might have to revisit my oil exposure.
3101 2018-12-19 19:08:52 The worlds top oil producers;                U.S.A.#1, Russia #2, Venezuela #11.
3102 2018-12-19 19:08:52 The non-oil sector is over 90% of GDP though. What you need is a level of stability in the oil sector (oil prices at $50-60 per barrel & production at 2.0mbpd minimum). That way, non-oil sector will benefit from the positive linkages from oil (FX supply, exchange rate stability).
3103 2018-12-19 19:08:39 Lmfao one of my dad's colleagues found oil on their land. He ended up selling MAJORITY of the land but kept royalities on what was sold and still holds a piece with minerals. 

Train up your doggo to sniff out oil/minerals on cue bro!
3104 2018-12-19 19:08:37 Been using olive oil since 2003. On a few occassions I ate food prepared with sunoil and I could immediately feel the difference in my system. Carbs or poison, I don’t know. But I did not feel ok for three days afterwards.
3105 2018-12-19 19:08:37 Trump didn't turn Syria into anything. The problems there existed long before he annoinced his intention to run for office. Again, what are we doing there? Who does it benefit? Genie Oil?
3106 2018-12-19 19:08:34 might fuck around and get my oil changed
3107 2018-12-19 19:08:30 kramp got me this beard oil for christmas and it smells like big chad energy
3108 2018-12-19 19:08:26 Um, no. They’ll make a deal with Syria to be a part of Syria. The oil will go back to being the property of the original owners. Guess who that was ? Yup that’s right, it was Syria. I wouldn’t sweat this that much if I were you.

3110 2018-12-19 19:08:16 How about this.stop importing oil from Saudi Arabia and take the 17 Billion the gov't would save and put it into the weather you feel you can changeThen do not withstanding clause as our oil is National interest according to Trudeau and get pipelines to market and coast to coast
3111 2018-12-19 19:08:15 and  Norway's state-owned oil company doesn't put less carbon into the sky
3112 2018-12-19 19:08:11 We wacha mchezo. Tunapatiana Gatundu!
3113 2018-12-19 19:08:10 Who canceled the Northern Gateway? Who changed the regs for Energy East?  Who nationalized the stalled KM pipeline? Who banned tankers for only Alberta oil off BC coast (C-74) ?  Who banned new pipelines (C-69)

I'll wait.
3114 2018-12-19 19:08:07 What you call “kurdish territory and oil fields” isn’t kurdish in the first place. It’s Arabic, it allways was... even  in the maps Kurdish seperatists have made these territories were never part of it, you guys claim to fight against imperialism and self-determinaon, while
3115 2018-12-19 19:08:05 The law uses a "but for test" in assessing responsibility. But for the actions of an oil and gas company in extracting, processing, selling oil and gas for the purpose of combustion, would those particular emissions have occurred? They're jointly responsible with the consumer.
3116 2018-12-19 19:08:04 Middle East likes to fight. Why should we referee. It was only about oil.
3117 2018-12-19 19:08:00 We've produced over 10 million barrels of diesel from synthetic crude oil during commissioning and start up. This fuels thousands of KMs travelled by school buses, snow plows, grain trucks, and fire engines.

3120 2018-12-19 19:07:41 Askies I see a lot of people wasting money by using it to cook their food normal olive oil is fine for cooking but for frying use sunflower or conola
3121 2018-12-19 19:07:38 اتعبني الفديو يارب العالمين حسبي انت ونعم الوكيل، عافينا واعف عنا ياالله ولا تسلط علينا من لا يخافك ولايخشاك
3122 2018-12-19 19:07:28 Now Lesego is saying we can't cook with olive oil? Bathong between Dr Sindi and Les life sucks shem

3124 2018-12-19 19:07:12 I made it up....it came out of nowhere. Very easy using LP guidelines. Roast veg until soft for 20 mins. Mash/blend. Add herbs, season. 1 tb LP flour. Role in olive oil, coat with LP bread crumbs. Dry fry in air fryer. Voila! X
3125 2018-12-19 19:07:04 I don't see that government in the US has shown much love for mass transit. They don't invest in it. Japan & countries in Europe have highly efficient mass transit. Some of the old mass transit in LA was taken down because of the oil lobby wanting to promote use of automobiles.
3126 2018-12-19 19:07:00 I agree he was worth it, all i was trying to point out was that Man Utd started the spending craze over here before the oil money came in
3127 2018-12-19 19:06:49 Scented candles (and any type of artificial scented stuff) is HIGHLY carcinogenic. Proven to cause cancer. Use only PURE essence oil instead. How abt an ornament?
3128 2018-12-19 19:06:04 They won’t be a third world STATE if Trump builds the wall and long as they got them oil wells.
3129 2018-12-19 19:05:50 I do all my own oil changes and the lite on so after work i gotta change my oil. I shoot for changing it 4 times a year but 3 is cool.
3130 2018-12-19 19:05:48 By those numbers Alberta needs to build at least 35 plants to process all of Alberta's oil at a cost of a quarter of a trillion dollars. What government or private business has that kind of coin just sitting around? So ya. You're just blowing smoke out your arse. No clue at all.
3131 2018-12-19 19:05:33 why is there a wierd oil stain on my desk. what is it. it smells really nice
3132 2018-12-19 19:05:31 Oil obvsly, minho needs smth as fancy and expensive as him
3133 2018-12-19 19:05:30 i was supposed to wake up at 9 am so i could get my oil changed and clean up but i ended up waking up at noon :)
3134 2018-12-19 19:05:19 The oil industry gives back to sustain communities is some large brain meme shit.
3135 2018-12-19 19:05:16 Definitely going to order some @BrawBeardOil products in the new year once I've finished my honest Amish order. Any recommendations on which oil and balm to buy?
3136 2018-12-19 19:05:06 I hope that oil painting of Trump and old Republican presidents is some kind of time delay trick where they all get revealed as Russians on the day of his impeachment
3137 2018-12-19 19:05:05 31 years ago 'now the oil is running down'
right from the start they said there was hardly any oil in Scottish waters, it wouldn't last long, it wasn't worth much
they lied repeatedly all the way to 2014
they value us by stealing from us
but apparently we're not a colony
3138 2018-12-19 19:05:03 Leger poll conducted on behalf of MEI:
66% of Quebecers prefer to get oil from Western Canada, 7% from the US, 3% from Algeria, 1% for ME countries.
Majority also want it shipped by pipelines.

The only dirty part is Trudeau & the Premier's conduct on the subject.

3139 2018-12-19 19:05:03 You mean you're not the Bushes, fighting for oil? So very totally awesome! Have you ordered the flags raised back up for a Kennedy killer yet, because I still see some at half? If not, please do so asap.
3140 2018-12-19 19:05:00 With my first day of vacation:  taking care of oil changes for both Cheryl and my cars, laundry, pet food shopping, responding to emails for last things at work, dropping off paper work at work, writing letter rec, writing thank you to professors, gym.  All before noon.
3141 2018-12-19 19:04:55 Planning ahead is different than actually transitioning to a new stable career though. It can take really long time. My brother-in-law did eventually leave oil after they saved enough for my sister to go to nursing school but it took like 18 years.
3142 2018-12-19 19:04:53 Payday tomorrow & I need my oil change .
3143 2018-12-19 19:04:52 Infact isnt the alliance the ones infested with curse flee infested mutts, Short tavern smelling never showered dwarves, oil smelling homeless gnomes, hippies who love trees a little too much, warmongering humans, dirty refugee goats and well pandas that live on turtles
3144 2018-12-19 19:04:50 I know how you feel. I sell CBD oil,  but have found nothing that helps severe chronic pain. It does help my depression. Blessings
3145 2018-12-19 19:04:50 Wrong! Index funds work through custodians such as Edward Jones. As of 2007 they can trade commodities...that is why crude oil went to $140 a barrel. They will buy CME Bitcoin futures and or Nasdaq Bitcoin futures...and possibly Bakkt futures...they don't need a ETF!!!
3146 2018-12-19 19:04:49 essential oil gods pls let me find my lavender oil
3147 2018-12-19 19:04:45 Yeah wasting all the time in Ottawa and trying to get rail cars to actually move the oil.  Legislating production cuts which increased the price of oil over night.  Who do these NDP think they are.  Get out, rally up the SoO like us do some grandstanding for White Jesus(tm) sake.
3148 2018-12-19 19:04:43 To repeat.@francoislegault .@JustinTrudeau .@gmbutts. 

This Poll clearly shows you are all #OutofTouch with the Electorate of Quebec.

Under your Circumstances there is no #appetite in Alberta for hobbling our access 2 Tidewater, or the importing of Oil, or Quebec Dairy Products
3149 2018-12-19 19:04:41 Didn't you hear? Oil and gas is automating so it will hire fewer people. Oil and gas cannot be fixed, start looking elsewhere.
3150 2018-12-19 19:04:31 I should of got my oil changed today 
3151 2018-12-19 19:04:15 Great another cute shirt I'm going to have to add to my collection. I don't see the tank top in mens though on the site. I'm a shade tree mechanic so it'd be hard to not naturally add those oil stains.
3152 2018-12-19 19:04:11 Snake oil!
3153 2018-12-19 19:04:10 @GarnierUK Hi does your ultimate blends shampoo/conditioner use sustainably sourced ingredients? such as the palm oil etc.
3154 2018-12-19 19:04:03 Ask him if he groped that reporters ass is a sexual manner.

Ask him if the poll showing quebecers want Alberta Oil means he will support energy east.

Ask him if he wants to disband the Canadian oil industry like he/Butts both have said on video.

Ask him something meaningful.
3155 2018-12-19 19:04:02 I'd say that we're not all that fractured a country. Most people don't want another pipeline, most people want to transition away from oil and commit to fighting climate change. We're not a fractured country, it's just that the small part has decided to turn against the rest
3156 2018-12-19 19:03:56 “I actually put way too much oil into the pan, but let's not confess kitchen secrets.”

He finished putting away the food as he took of his jacket finally. Placing the jacket onto the hook, he gave a soft smile. 

“Oh you're off? I was going to sneak my lover in for a shower.”

3157 2018-12-19 19:03:51 That made me laugh again.

Kane on the bench with Olbas Oil, honey & lemon, a bobble hat and a hot water bottle  Hopefully resting up to be well for Everton!
3160 2018-12-19 19:03:19 Without decent extra virgin olive oil and tinned tomatoes how can anyone expect to make a decent tomato sauce? Why haven't the government thought of this?
3161 2018-12-19 19:03:12 The moment your mum walks in with lavender oil and asks if you’d like it massaged in my hair because she’s concerned. Fuck it off Helen
3162 2018-12-19 19:03:09 @elonmusk  continued; to all people on both sides of it and ask mexico to pay their share and even allow the oil people to add a pipeline to the span . all sides win in some way and both country's benefit in many ways, you can do it! just give me verbal recognition for the idea.
3163 2018-12-19 19:03:09 Oil people are too stupid to realize that. Brett Blame the Irving's u gros bebé.
3164 2018-12-19 19:03:08 [Man grabs chest & collapses in line at supermarket]

Cashier: “Someone call an ambulance!”

Girl from high school always posting about CBD oil on Facebook: “Wait! I have something better!”
3165 2018-12-19 19:02:51 Easy Owen...they said it was fucked since Thatcher. If Thatcher didn't misused the oil money of BP than following Norway by example, the country could have been just fine within
3166 2018-12-19 19:02:40 The tax breaks = CEO bonus $$$. Wait until you file your income tax this year before you defend the economics especially with the stock market dropping and everyday prices rising. Oil is down, but when that happens it doesn’t last long and we end up paying higher prices elsewhere
3167 2018-12-19 19:02:40 It's true extra virgin olive oil is for salads and pouring on pasta before eating for flavor not for cooking cause it burns quickly and loose its flavor
3168 2018-12-19 19:02:23 Don’t dip like your check for oil! 


3169 2018-12-19 19:02:21 blood is happy, oil is happy
3170 2018-12-19 19:02:14 Sturgeon Oil Refinery built with government loans was priced at 7 billionth build over 4 years. Actual cost is now over 9 billion and took approx 5 years to build. It can process only 79, 000 barrels a day. Alberta Oilsands and insitu produce 2.8 million a day.
3171 2018-12-19 19:02:13 Beto is the choice of the Oil & Gas Industry too, what are the odds?

He lost to Ted Cruz and that somehow qualifies him to be the Dem establishment choice? Nah. Look at his voting record and donors and Beto quickly becomes a HELL NO.
3172 2018-12-19 19:02:06 Maybe, just maybe, the wages are virtually the same, except for the existence of a group of people in Alberta in the oil patch who manage to make $100k to several million. Really kinda skews our average.
3173 2018-12-19 19:02:04 An economy based on sales of irn bru, tennants, haggis, deep fried mars bars and box sets of take the high road and taggart is going to give you an economy parallel to that of Serbia... And as for this imaginary oil source... Where? We get it all from Russia and Saudi
3174 2018-12-19 19:02:02 I hate people who sit in waiting rooms and breathe heavy like OKAY JERRY NONE OF US LIKE WAITING FOR OIL CHANGES THANK U
3175 2018-12-19 19:01:50 As if @Minister_Harwin Could give a stuff about people's homes. He's got snake oil to flog. @AngusTaylorMP @ScottMorrisonMP @GladysB

3177 2018-12-19 19:01:35 Iwobi  can't create up to ozil even mkhi is not up to Oil standard he should brief us something is wrong
3178 2018-12-19 19:01:32 To be clear I don't support blaming Trudeau. I also think there are circumstances which make it harder for people to leave oil like lack of education, families to support, or if they live in an oil city where it's the main employment.
3179 2018-12-19 19:01:26 And keeping fuel prices low by pumping record oil and gas—which is terrible for Putin.

3190 2018-12-19 19:00:47 The oil business is failing because of the Alberta government.  I live in nova Scotia were our main energy was coal. Once the closed out most of coal mines we found other ways to make a living maybe it is time for Alberta to do the same
3191 2018-12-19 19:00:47 Happy #waxwednesday Friends  #oil #wax
3192 2018-12-19 19:00:45 @statedept before demanding protesters stop at elsharara oil field in south libya, you need to investigate the situation more closely.The government of Libya continues to fail on its commitments in the South. Demands won't work - development & diplomacy will.

And as per govt. , they can't do anything in price rise then how you can take credit on low prices????
3196 2018-12-19 19:00:32 Ha ha. Yes, I had NO idea that Sweden and Finland are separate countries... Did you know that there are regions in Alberta that don’t produce oil? Yet those regions still fund the large equalization payments that move east. Makes it hard to put a trillion $ account together.

3202 2018-12-19 19:00:01 There is no shortage of oil anywhere. With cartels like OPEC setting supply and mandated gov't production cuts how is that even an argument?  I've never suggested we go without oil.
3203 2018-12-19 18:59:52 Is this the oil drilling/Exxon connection that we heard about early on? I wonder how much Trump is/was expected to make from that deal.
3204 2018-12-19 18:59:48 @catericasola spot the giant bottle of olive oil
3205 2018-12-19 18:59:45 Given that you guys supply the US with 80% of their oil, I think part of the new agreement should be higher oil prices for the US if they're putting tarrifs on Canada
3206 2018-12-19 18:59:39 Pipelines to where? Is there refining capacity for WCS at the destination? 
Those are important questions to research, if you think pipelines will fix the price issue for #ableg oil. 
#cdnpoli
3207 2018-12-19 18:59:38 I guess they will be buying their oil from the U.S. (:
3208 2018-12-19 18:59:33 "I'm a progressive who is for more oil pipelines, selling weapons to human rights abusing regimes, and lower taxes for corporations" Save ya'll a bunch of time.
3209 2018-12-19 18:59:17 Help how long is too long to wait to get your oil changed?
3210 2018-12-19 18:59:14 I still asked you when God said the oil that you need in your lamps was that because you have not been praying and you're not prayed up and you need others to pray for you that uses their oil that's inside them and praying for the other grones God knows all things father learning
3211 2018-12-19 18:59:12 I doubt they'll even bother going that far. Turkey gets their Northern slice...government/iran/Russia recapture oil fields...
3212 2018-12-19 18:59:08 My everyday diet is 3 + 5 (olive oil) + [1 or 2 or 4]. I rarely eat number 6.

3218 2018-12-19 18:58:39 Tar and oil are two different things. Perhaps you should stop using the talking points from the Tides Foundation and better educate your self. It would help in furthering this discussion. That being said, let's venture into the realm of reality in building infrastructure.
3219 2018-12-19 18:58:37 nobody:

me: SMOKING GAS GOT MY TANK ON 93 SUPREME SMOKING GAS DRINKING OIL NO KEROSENE
3220 2018-12-19 18:58:37 We don't have any business in being in Syria. Let Assad deal with his own country. We already invaded so many place and for what? Gas? Oil? Power?
3221 2018-12-19 18:58:30 This is where the big money is, isn't it? Is this the oil drilling/Exxon connection we heard about early on?
3222 2018-12-19 18:58:23 one of my fish oil pills fell on the floor and got run over by my computer chair and now it's all slippery there

3225 2018-12-19 18:57:51 Stop putting your thump up there azz use the pinky to check oil
3226 2018-12-19 18:57:48 Well you are not thinking about the rest of canada when Trudeau was going to invest in pipeline. But know they are going to give money . You dont want it. The rest of Canada is starting to go other Avenues with wind and tidal energy. Oil is dying out just like coal did.
3227 2018-12-19 18:57:42 I completely disagree with Trudeau about immigration, oil development, military development and use and all his fiscal policy.
3228 2018-12-19 18:57:37 step pops getting me two new tires and a oil change, happy early birthday to meeee 
3229 2018-12-19 18:57:27 “Yea you drinking caster oil after the 24th” 
3230 2018-12-19 18:57:19 *That price line of $60 per barrel with regards to funding the #Budget2019 for me doesn't go well.
What if Venezuela just drop the crude oil price to $40 per barrel or lesser ?? We fall back into recession?? 
*Secondly I saw 2.3million barrel per day ,is that achievable??
3231 2018-12-19 18:57:17 Its not from oil and gas though, it was from over 3000 companies that are directly involved in the industry as I've already said that includes the company that sells the shit roll used on oil rigs, tell me you understand that?
3232 2018-12-19 18:57:14 Duh. Because they are BIG OIL. 
THEY will be out of business in 10 years as we accelerate the acceleration of sustainable futures

3234 2018-12-19 18:57:11 I am about ready to start a tweet army for shit like this and the bs about the differential affecting every barrel of oil produced in Canada. WHAT WILL IT TAKE, LORD.
3235 2018-12-19 18:57:06 I don’t always smoke medicinal but I always take my sweet CBD oil . It helps w anxiety . 
3236 2018-12-19 18:57:06 It's the reason for all the social reforms, too. MBS wants to make Saudi a tourism-friendly country since he knows that oil isn't the future.
3237 2018-12-19 18:56:58 Respect to the article & agreed.  There is no discipline in the E&P sector. The implied capital tied up in perpetually increasing tight oil DUC's is a slap in the face to returning capital to investors.  What industry holds at least years worth of inventory?
3238 2018-12-19 18:56:57 I got an oil change!!
3239 2018-12-19 18:56:48 Gettin the oil checked after 45 is a every 5 year deal ..sigh ..I'm 65 . No longer miss that cheeseburger from 2012.
3240 2018-12-19 18:56:44 if the common denominator is the dry food she may be intolerant of whatever grain or oil is in the kibble.

cats are obligate carnivores.
if you can afford wet food or raw human food just give her that.
3241 2018-12-19 18:56:41 Can't see it. Assad has too many cards here...far more likely to let Turkey have that Northern slice while SAA move into oil fields to the South...Never interrupt your enemy if he's in the course of doing you a favour...
3242 2018-12-19 18:56:35 that allegory from Skyfall about the rats and the oil drum except it's Glenn Greenwald and Bill Kristol and also you just toss the oil drum into a volcano
3243 2018-12-19 18:56:25 I prefer the oil
3244 2018-12-19 18:56:22 Immigration has a larger carbon foot print than the gas and oil industry. Since Canada banned pipelines, immigration should also be banned.
3245 2018-12-19 18:56:17 Aww sorry to hear that. Is it painful? I’m 5m PP & still have a hard time doing certain ab workouts  I know my bod needs more time to adjust but shea &  oil did wonders for me.  Keep it going, I love how soft it keeps my skin
3246 2018-12-19 18:56:03 I second tea tree oil!! It works so much better for me than anything with salicylic acid in it lmao

3248 2018-12-19 18:56:02 Where does jiffy lube get off charging 45 dollars for their cheapest oil change tf
3249 2018-12-19 18:55:58 Yep, I only drink distilled water and don't use fluoride whatsoever. Cilantro oil is a heavy metal detoxifier that helped me to focus better.
3250 2018-12-19 18:55:55 @DOIDepSec it is dead wrong to have a man in the pocket big oil and gas to be interior secretary your just a puppet of big oil who will make his choices based on profit and not the peoples and animals lives this country is doomed with people like you in power
3251 2018-12-19 18:55:32 Imagine that what be a disaster for all central banks .. this low oil  price is a blessing in disguise... 5 minutes till Algos take stops ;)
3252 2018-12-19 18:55:27 Also bring mini deodorant, oil blotting sheets, and a mini body spray. You will be there all day, so you'll want to freshen up a bit for photos
3253 2018-12-19 18:55:14 I don't have oil 
3254 2018-12-19 18:55:13 Kill 200,000 high paying jobs in the oil patch will help reduce income inequality in Canada.  Thanks for being so caring Liberals!
3255 2018-12-19 18:55:00 No the £35bn is what 3000+ companies that are directly involved in the oil and gas sector make for the UK economy, that includes firms in England that make components for the oil industry, the likes of Ineos, transportation of goods, everyone and company involved.
3256 2018-12-19 18:54:57 I was going to get my oil changed but it’s raining so
3257 2018-12-19 18:54:55 My parents are so amazing.... They both have the week off so they have been watching my boys... My dad did my breaks and oil on my car and made steak when i got there from a long day of work...uhg i love them. #blessed
3258 2018-12-19 18:54:46 How wonderful is #Unastubbs with @VictoriaCoren @BBCRadio4 ?
3259 2018-12-19 18:54:46 I actually wouldn't be surprised if @StatCan_eng was involved.  The Canadian @liberal_party recently decided to allow Stats Canada to demand personal banking info from Canadian banks.
There is a link between RBC, Oil and Gas, and @JustinTrudeau
3260 2018-12-19 18:54:41 People that don't want to stand watch over their pasta put oil in the water to keep the noodles from sticking together. This is wrong. Oily pasta keeps the sauce from sticking to the pasta properly.
3261 2018-12-19 18:54:26 my oil is literally oozing out of me, i'm so horny for a hot piece of hummer ass
3262 2018-12-19 18:54:19 ينفع استخدم Bio oil للوجه ؟؟
3263 2018-12-19 18:54:17 Acknowledge there are multiple factors to blame, among them ranchers’ access to public lands secured for wild horses’ use via legislation years ago. Oil and other industries play their own role in this matter too.
3264 2018-12-19 18:54:11 Today, very few rich folks benefit from the barrels of crude oil sold daily. If NNPC is sold, people will be able to buy shares and get money (dividends). Today everyone owns a phone unlike before when it was limited to a few rich folks. ignorance is Nigeria’s greatest problem.
3265 2018-12-19 18:54:07 And you'll get slapped back to the oil rigs
3266 2018-12-19 18:54:00 So here's the deal.

Trump says he "withdrew" combatants from #Syria and pleases voters
Trump keeps "US advisors" to overlook the stealing of Syrian oil and keeps the arms coming for the SDF and pleases the Pentagon and the hawks

Cont.
3267 2018-12-19 18:53:59 even with new oil extraction techniques, we could only maintain our oil supplies until 2175-2200 at the latest, if energy usage stayed the same. which it won't
3268 2018-12-19 18:53:38 Excellent. Were you using oil pastels?
3269 2018-12-19 18:53:33 Fake info, or are you not smart enough to realize that a good portion of all of those things are spin off economic activity? 

Even using a diversified national  capital velocity model would print the numbers you’re showing at me at nearly half the economy with oil as a base.
3270 2018-12-19 18:53:22 When the oil runs out, we'll all be very poor.
3271 2018-12-19 18:53:16 Yes, segregated, unequal Latin American cities are ten a penny, but I've personally never felt it so strongly as in Caracas. Possibly the oil turns the extremes up a notch, as it does with everything else.

Good luck with it anyway. Tis a tough job covering Venezuela I'm sure.
3272 2018-12-19 18:53:11 @RalphGarman and @eddiepence there are ways to make stretching your ears hurt less. I found this out after I got to my last size up but olive oil helps
3273 2018-12-19 18:53:08 How about investing in oil that can evaporate? President talking like a #wee smoker.
3274 2018-12-19 18:53:08 That is *exactly* what he is saying. And Notley's "remove the handcuffs" means overrule the court's decision and give us free reign to ruin the environment and waterways. They're not even masking it. Oil at whatever cost!
3275 2018-12-19 18:53:02 Bush and Chaney made us self dependent of oil , not Obama. Obama stopped putting oil in the national reserve . B/C pored money in horizontal drilling and frac’ing technology. Flooded the market. Wells went from 25bbl a day to 250bbl a day.  Dick got rich.
3276 2018-12-19 18:52:53 If he doesn't care about a man being dismembered because his pal MBS provides oil, he really won't care about women being water-boarded.

3278 2018-12-19 18:52:36 Want silk-like skin, fast? After a shower, while your skin's still damp, apply olive oil all over your body and pat dry with a damp towel.

3281 2018-12-19 18:52:25 The important question of if they would prefer to be fully " renewable" soon instead of oil dependant seems to have been left out...
3282 2018-12-19 18:52:25 Montreal has stopped issuing permits for wood fired bakery businesses - the Montreal Bagel is famous -  due to air quality -  many supplement heat there with wood stoves -  had an oil burner forced air - oil  hot water  in the 70s when living there
3283 2018-12-19 18:52:17 Of all the oil reserves we have NOW already dug up we can't use them all it would send the world past the point of no return with climate change so right now, there is no sane reason for any oil drilling to be taking place. 

Capitalism is going to kill us all.

3289 2018-12-19 18:51:25 True to form, your organization convinced whistler to come out against the oil sector and when they pushed backed and removed their business it was and will be the workers in whistler that will pay the price. You will just move onto the next town or city and use them as pawns.

3294 2018-12-19 18:50:43 For Earth's Most Popular Politician ™ Those numbers seem bad. Oh, I know! Facts are rigged and Corporate Shills that get money from oil companies.
3295 2018-12-19 18:50:39 I had no idea castor oil is good for them. My friends has one passed down from her mother that’s about 50 years old. 100 is pretty cool.
3296 2018-12-19 18:50:32 Where did the money come from to purchase the oil painting? Hmmm...
3297 2018-12-19 18:50:27 Con todo esto de que el Bitcoin subió +800$ en 3 días, nadie se dio cuenta que el OIL bajo hasta 45$, el oro rompio los 1250$ y la T10 del metro de Bcn a 10.20€. Que bolas lo del metro. En fin.
3298 2018-12-19 18:50:27 Say what you want about Bernie, but he is strongly associated with a list of very specific reforms and legislative goals. His supporters aren't going to be interested in someone that speaks only in platitudes, while taking oil company executive money in through the back door.

3304 2018-12-19 18:50:19 Saudi Arabia's finance minister said on Wednesday he was not concerned about current oil prices impacting spending plans in 2019, and the government still aims to close its budget deficit by 2023 although the target is not set in stone.
3305 2018-12-19 18:50:16 3/ China has been saying "You take the USD's, we'll take the [copper, cobalt, rare earths, oil, gold, ports, etc]" because they understand those items are finite in physical form while US deficits will not be given $100-200T in entitlements that 2008 proved we WILL print.

3308 2018-12-19 18:49:56 Either will work. The subject is not the logistics of moving the oil but the actual taking of natural resources unchecked (and in the case of the US complicit).

If anyone had any belief that the corn vs oil, corn would win
3313 2018-12-19 18:49:20 That’s different from taxes gained from the oil. These only come from profits or licenses.

3315 2018-12-19 18:49:16 EPA’s small refinery exemptions have undercut demand for biodiesel by more than 300 million gallons. Rather than ensuring the #RFS program works to grow advanced biofuel use, as Congress intended, @EPA is handing out favors to the biggest, most profitable oil refiners.

3323 2018-12-19 18:49:02 I wouldn’t let it get to you. Half these TSLAQ shorts are oil and auto industry people. Doing their best to survive the inevitable.
3324 2018-12-19 18:48:55 What’s a bad thing? Moscow Letter of intent? Pulling troops out? Tipping off Russia about an assault on Assad? Giving Russia access to oil routes? Pulling out of a major terror hub and creating a power vacuum in the Middle East? 

Take your pick...

3331 2018-12-19 18:48:10 If AB separates, like all you ABexiters want, then that's something you'll need to sort out for yourselves.  I'm sure you can strike a deal with The Canadas and the United States. But when you run out of oil, then what? Who will help you then? Who will want you then? The US???
3332 2018-12-19 18:48:10 balms make my beard rugged looking, I just brush it and use beard oil or coconut oil for healthy shine
3333 2018-12-19 18:48:06 No. GOP has gone over to Russia, white supremacy, far rt deregulation & oil/business oligarchs of the world side. They will never live up to their side of any bargain. They mean to rule the world.
3334 2018-12-19 18:48:06 #Fed will hike and leave everything open /data dependent. They won't change dot plot but will sound cautionary on low inflation (on lower oil). So I say mildly dovish but not as dovish as the market has priced in
3335 2018-12-19 18:48:05 @TheShowThor @TheShow1053 P1 podcast is only advertisement for cbd oil fyi. Did Dario mess up lol
3336 2018-12-19 18:47:55 When #WTI is below breakeven but you still got to pay water disposal fees for the 6bbl of water you’re producing for every bbl of oil.. might as well make a lake in WT to water ski on. :)
3337 2018-12-19 18:47:54 My assistant gave me a bottle of off-brand olive oil, a sample pack of baby wipes, and the gift card she used to buy these items – not sure how I will ever thank her for this gift.

Won't allow energy east pipeline, but they're ok w blood oil from Saudis & other rabidly anti-human rights regimes.

3350 2018-12-19 18:46:34 Would you believe US only imports 11% of its oil from Saudi, 40% of US oil comes from Canada.
3351 2018-12-19 18:46:31 I'm very grateful to my little red Hyundai - all cars should run like it has! A little oil change every once in a while goes a long way, apparently! Happy Holidays to you and yours, too!

3361 2018-12-19 18:45:46 Which would mean higher rates equal higher oil prices .. don’t really see that
3362 2018-12-19 18:45:30 Yes, IF your plan is to continue to accelerate global warming in order to mollify a handful of selfish troglodytes in the oil patch. Because that is the only thing your “plan” is accomplishing. Congrats on that.
3363 2018-12-19 18:45:25 Yes, harsh chemo almost killed me! Rick Simpson Oil and oxygenated water were what finally shrunk my 3rd cancer. Chemo didn't do anything but make me deathly Ill for a solid year. You must supplement alternative treatments to your chemo. You don't get CAT scans w/o an Oncologist.
3364 2018-12-19 18:45:24 Is bigger than ur pet hate politicians. The EU is a quite different type of union from the UK (duh),  tho whether we're in it would be up to the people. As for 'theres nae oil and its aw runnin oot onyway'; Norway, not to mention the McCrone report. Define financially stable ...
3365 2018-12-19 18:45:23 Thanks! I will make sure the daughter knows the oil trick! 
3366 2018-12-19 18:45:21 Rotary engines became obsolete in the 1920s. The "round" engines of WW2 are called "radial". These engines use gasoline. Jet engines use diesel. Germany was forced to develop jet engines because they had very little oil. They made their diesel the way we make "bio diesel" now.

We are surplus in water, wood, electricity, beef, fish and shellfish, pork, cereals and dozens of other resources.
Any suggestion that Scotland is a dependent nation deserves to be ridiculed.

Kkkkkkkk
3376 2018-12-19 18:44:35 Use lots of oil, so it doesn't stick to the pan when you scrape it into the garbage
3377 2018-12-19 18:44:32 No way I’m using olive oil to cook eggs. The taste of olive oil is to strong.
3378 2018-12-19 18:44:29 For sure, especially around this time of year when allergens get worse. Since CBD oil is concentrated in labs, pollen wouldn't contaminate the container as long as it's kept secure and inside. Hope that helps! If you are taking other medications, be sure to ask your physician :)
3379 2018-12-19 18:44:26 Scrapping the arms deal saves Yemeni lives, of which Scheer doesn't care about. It was Harper's deal to begin with. Not importing oil doesn't have anything to do with weapons. AB doesn't want SA oil in Canada and they've been adamant about it. They want that damned pipeline.
3380 2018-12-19 18:44:22 Oil had the double top today . Bought $HOD  at 8.20 when RSI was over 80+ on the 5 mins chart and sold it at 8.50  when RSI started to turn up around. Patiently waiting for the Fed  announcement
3381 2018-12-19 18:44:11 President Obama defeated ISIS with 26,000 air-strikes crippling their financial network, not Donald Trump. Syria is a vacuum for terrorists. We must support the people of the Middle East in their fight for freedom against totalitarian dictators and oppose nation building for oil
3382 2018-12-19 18:44:10 Saudi Arabia planning to replace Oil revenues in future with guess what ? Creating and attracting equal revenues by promoting Hajj pilgrimage- difficult to believe, but it’s in official national plans - current investments earmarked annually to seed  project
3383 2018-12-19 18:43:54 We need Scientific voices willing to stand up and target the oil industry paid opinions, straight out, gloves off the liers are going down.

3390 2018-12-19 18:43:15 I say again no Albertan HAS to use this or any EI money if they feel dirty doing so. And also since building the pipeline is so easy (would not even fix the low oil prices for the province but who cares) why wasn't it already built? Andy was in a government for 10 yrs and nadda.
3391 2018-12-19 18:43:14 I used to work for dealership that had and oil change specific Department... Those Lube technicians are mostly making 9 to $12 an hour at most. Now the technicians that work back in the actual shop, they make a higher labor rate, but get paid by the job.

3394 2018-12-19 18:42:35 The mayor did the right thing & should not be apologizing for his actions. Oil & gas has to pay for their destruction of our environment.
3395 2018-12-19 18:42:31 The government should at least called a halt to any further dairy expansion.  Clearly, it's gone too far already and that excludes the impact of methane.  They shuttered the oil and gas industry without too much thought.  Why is dairy so sacred?
3396 2018-12-19 18:42:28 Companies that build oil infrastructure have a lot of money bets here. What steps need to be made to address this?
3397 2018-12-19 18:42:27 Double standards and USA  work hand in glove. I have a disc of a former CIA spy agent who revealed that the US constructed an embassy that is bigger than the Vatican in Iraq.They used WMD as an excuse to have access to oil.Westgate embassy has a lot of hints on us as country.

3399 2018-12-19 18:42:22 Oh I agree. It’s a trend in goaltending that I see and do not understand. In fact, I think it is slightly out of step from where the NHL is headed (more room, offence, etc), and will (like all things) need to evolve w the league. 
3400 2018-12-19 18:42:21 Oh I had someone trap me in the yoga studio changing room talking about NLP the other week, the snakiest of snake oil sibling of CBT
3401 2018-12-19 18:42:15 Whisk together egg, milk, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a bowl. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cookies into the batter one at a time, and carefully place into the hot frying oil.
3402 2018-12-19 18:42:06 @calorireland ordered my gas this morning thinking I'd be fine for delivery by Christmas.  Used get my oil turned around in a day or so.  Anything you can do to ensure we get delivery?  Cheers
3403 2018-12-19 18:42:05 y’all i finally got my cars oil changed and my phone screen fixed, I feel so accomplished.
3404 2018-12-19 18:41:55 Hi Albertan here. Lemme give some (brief) local context. We of course are not jumping this bandwagon (at least not yet) but I can see why extremists are starting to push this idea. We have always felt that our oil is of great importance to the country.
3405 2018-12-19 18:41:54 Will SAA enter the oil- and gasfields too? Or only border area?
3406 2018-12-19 18:41:51 Frank truth they just told you.
3407 2018-12-19 18:41:50 need to go get me a oil change but I don’t feel like it
3408 2018-12-19 18:41:43 Red Stick Spice Co - love their custom spice blends named after BR neighborhoods and Meyers lemon olive oil - great gift boxes too
3409 2018-12-19 18:41:37 Cool. Well, I’m enjoying the digital thus far, though still mostly mucking around with the messy oil paints.
3410 2018-12-19 18:41:36 Thanks all. My point was disaggregating broker forecasts show oil cash flow downgrade given Brent fall but a gas flow upgrade given Dutch gas move. Gas upgrade greater than oil downgrade. Stock cheap I think. Hoping resources to reserve move soon.
3411 2018-12-19 18:41:33 If I have rats, I call an exterminator. He does the job and goes home, he doesnt move into my guest bedroom for life.
3412 2018-12-19 18:41:27 Now wait until the GOP allows them to be killed by trophy hunters or oil drilling.
3413 2018-12-19 18:41:20 "OIL CITY" Ya gotta love the smell of diesel in the morning! Crude goop has to be seriously cooked at boiling temperatures to make high octane products. Yum... think of this place as a fine petroleum bistro. #Music #Show by STAGGER BACK, RAVENER, THE DIRTY DANS and STU MERCER.
3414 2018-12-19 18:40:49 I totally get ya there. I’ve been in business for a little while, so I’ve dealt with people like him. I just cannot understand how people didn’t see CON all over the guy. It’s like con=olive oil and he bathed in it. Wayyyy too slick for me.
3415 2018-12-19 18:40:47 Am I at my lowest or highest if I’m using a toilet seat cover as an oil blotting paper? A life hack if I’ve ever seen one.
3416 2018-12-19 18:40:43 You must cut out sugar! And no vitamin supplements, sugar and extra vitamins feed cancer. I beat my 3rd cancer with Rick Simpson Oil and oxygenated water. Harsh chemo didn't stop the growth. RSO is expensive, but the oxygenated water is cheap. And prayers are free!
3417 2018-12-19 18:40:38 @Bill_Morneau you said AB's problem with low oil prices & high price differential is not bad enough to receive help. 100k+ workers have lost their job in AB, that's not bad enough?
3418 2018-12-19 18:40:34 Okay Castor Oil

3419 2018-12-19 18:40:27 When I worked for Chevron back in the early eighties I always wondered why they drilled wells when they knew there was no oil.

3422 2018-12-19 18:40:19 What track record?  Cancelling pipelines and putting bills in place to impede new pipelines and Barr tankers for Alberta Oil???. That a legacy!

In case you didn't think of i,  don't renew the lease on your office past this coming fall.
3423 2018-12-19 18:40:19 If there's so much refining space then why ship dilbit by pipeline? Nobody wants that moving through their land.

The US screws everyone. AB is in a squeeze due to them & oil glut. Pipelines are best mode of transport but they have to be made better with more checks.
3424 2018-12-19 18:40:16 I love Cutter’s Way. A very clever rendering of the intractable issue of conspiracy theories about big oil. John Heard was outstanding.
3425 2018-12-19 18:40:13 [#goodtoknow 3]

The enrichment of the Earth's atmosphere with greenhouse gases is based in particular on the use of fossil fuels (brown coal, hard coal, natural gas, oil, peat), the global cutting down of forests as well as agriculture and animal husbandry.
3426 2018-12-19 18:40:11 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
3427 2018-12-19 18:40:11 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

3430 2018-12-19 18:40:03 The same world as Obama who is taking credit for the US becoming energy independent with oil.
3431 2018-12-19 18:39:55 Yes ! I’ve been using vinosource whipped moisturizer and the hydrating serum and they’re wonderful !!!! Also the green tea detox oil for night time. I want more but am not yet able to afford branching out to their whole line !!! Lol
3432 2018-12-19 18:39:54 Yeah we can pull out of Syria, and leave all that oil go Putin! Nicely played  Putin, your puppet Donald, is working out very well for you! What are you going to do when he’s in prison?
3433 2018-12-19 18:39:46 Birthright  Day #3 Today we were joined by our 8 Israeli participants we then went Jeeping at the Jordan River, went to Mt Bental Syria border in the Golan Heights followed by an olive oil factory. Tonight is our last night in the North.
3434 2018-12-19 18:39:25 Can't touch hash mate, it'd cost me my job. I'm waiting for a definitive answer from my HR if I'm ok to try CBD oil. I've seen yes n no answers online so I'm not taking a chance.
3435 2018-12-19 18:39:25 *yells across hallway* Hey @Barron_Energy, after the recent price declines in oil that are eerily similar to those of 2014, how do the financials of the oil&gas companies you track look? #OOTT
3436 2018-12-19 18:39:19 All the people that moved there were killing it in oil boom, maybe still so?
3437 2018-12-19 18:39:16 Snake oil salesmen! Lies lies lies

3439 2018-12-19 18:39:09 You did read the article didn't you, the £35bn is overall when you take into consideration the 3000+ companies that are directly involved, that could be from the oil companies themselves to the company that sells the shit roll they use on the rigs you zoomer.
3440 2018-12-19 18:39:05 @AMAG_Media thanks for not doing the oil service today when the light came on during its 2 day visit to your workshops!!
Very poor service!
I hope there aren’t any problems on my 3,500km journey next week!
3441 2018-12-19 18:39:05 The letter of intent I wish to see is from Putin to trump for lifting the Magnitsky act sanctions, rumored to be $500 million + as a reward for arctic oil drilling profits.
3442 2018-12-19 18:38:57 $ygr nice day up 10% one of the oil names I picked up in this carnage. Some nice insider buying. Great small co not many talk about
3443 2018-12-19 18:38:56 Amen Jack a healthy Oil Industry helps all Canadians
3444 2018-12-19 18:38:56 If making brownies, take the oil that the recipe calls for and simmer the “seasonings” in it before mixing and baking. Seasonings should be ground fine first. Try 1 tsp. Eat 1/2 brownie 1st time. Adjust from there. (Or so I’ve heard)
3445 2018-12-19 18:38:53 I am against America waging war on Afghanistan, Iraq, and the rest of the middle east. We are only at war with those countries to steal their oil. That's why Russia oppose our actions. America is bad. America is the one waging war on the middle east to steal oil.
3446 2018-12-19 18:38:37 Whale Oil Beef Hooked. 

Aleafia Health (Cannabis is equal to murder Fantino) is buying out Emblem Cannabis, the company that employed/s (?) the man responsible for Oxycodone in Canada. 

This is why we don't support the "legal" industry.

3447 2018-12-19 18:38:31 Are Google and Facebook the new oil monopolies?

3453 2018-12-19 18:38:03 But we'd never have had oil in those days like petrol so wouldn't have had chance to learn that association :/
3454 2018-12-19 18:37:57 And yet, USA is right now profiting from free oil as payment for destroying a nation & killing 150,000 of its people, for made-up WMDs & non-existent terror attacks. But apparently, Saddam was evil for killing Iraqis...
3455 2018-12-19 18:37:54 The US used the YPG to push for regime change under Obama in order to secure access to an oil pipeline. The US under Trump is now bowing to Russian / Turkish influence and will depart. It was never about ISIL.
3456 2018-12-19 18:37:52 said coworker that is annoying came over to complain about the food at the restaurant we're going to tomorrow because it's Too Fancy and also olive oil cake
3457 2018-12-19 18:37:49 DOD, pres takes his ordrs frm puty & he told trump get of Syria. Oil 4 puty. Repoobs HELLOOO!!!
3458 2018-12-19 18:37:41 We could make it really hard for BC to get it's products to the rest of Canada, while working with the US to grow our economy. Not to mention not having to sell gas and oil to Canada, once Albert was done Canada would be begging for a pipeline across borders.
3459 2018-12-19 18:37:38 @Asad_Umar Crude Oil prices are $57, a 2 year low. Are you looking to drop oil prices in Pakistan?
3460 2018-12-19 18:37:37 LOL. But yah, I dislike the conflation of success of the oil industry with success of Alberta. Presumably, other parts of the world manage to prosper without one. A disappointing lack of imagination is on display here.
3461 2018-12-19 18:37:28 Scheer was incorrect as usual. Guess where Quebec gets its oil? 44% from Western Canada thanks to the reversal of line 9. Crude now going to Montreal refinery. Use to be 1% in Harper days.  Other  37% from USA . However,  CPC Peter Mackay Irving  Oil get 38% from the Middle East
3462 2018-12-19 18:37:12 Blackstone - bayrock group. 
Tillerson- Exxon 
Rosneft oil 
Putin
....etc etc

I mean it's almost like Twitter is tweeting too much and not reading enough. 

Writings been on the wall for at least a few years. 

Carry on now.
3463 2018-12-19 18:37:04 Gotta be a lot of oil money going to the politicians to sell out their people.

3465 2018-12-19 18:36:35 @NicolaSturgeon honest question,if you dont respect the EU referendum result why would you accept result and how would you feel if you won your referendum of an independent Scotland only for it to be disregarded similarly , ie $113 barrels of oil and £250 million start up costs
3466 2018-12-19 18:36:33 I am a 3 time cancer survivor. The last one was lung cancer. I used Rick Simpson Oil after a year of harsh chemo. They put me on Opdivo for the final year. My Oncologist doesn't believe it helped. 3 months after starting RSO my cancer reduced by 75%. 3 months cancer free now!
3467 2018-12-19 18:36:29 This isn’t really one I can delve into in a blog but they absolutely are. We discuss some targeting of Oil and Gas in our publicly available threat adversary posts.
3468 2018-12-19 18:36:25 Said last night there had to be another angle and now we all have it. Thanks for sharing the shot Jason
3469 2018-12-19 18:36:24 The real debate is do you put the salt BEFORE or AFTER the pasta goes in. This is a strong debate in my family. (No oil btw)
3470 2018-12-19 18:36:22 My mom got me an essential oil diffuser shaped like a whale :)
3471 2018-12-19 18:35:56 To right. And tankers will be still rolling over the festive season.

#ukog don't stop . Cash flow from oil sales is King!
3472 2018-12-19 18:35:50 Who/What have you been wasting your oil on?

3474 2018-12-19 18:35:43 I cannot find the part to take my oil cap thing off.
3475 2018-12-19 18:35:37 it smells interesting i guess haha there's something similar thats made from tea tree oil and IT SMELLS AMAZING (to me lol some ppl hate it)

oh wow what if u wore a cap too + the mask lmao INSTANT CELEBRITY FEELS. WOW I STAN :')))

yES ;A; i only dare to use vaseline now alskjdf
3476 2018-12-19 18:35:36 I would presume more linchpin than all out reason. There was definitely far too many trades reporterd Long all year via CoT. But also shady overnight book moves during Septemeber that no one questioned put the final air into 2018 oil bubble. It's a shame,I was short 1mth too soon
3477 2018-12-19 18:35:11 oil, same as it ever was
3478 2018-12-19 18:34:58 Yes , WD40 great stuff and always has been , that and 3 in 1 oil .

3481 2018-12-19 18:34:45 Making a living in the oil and gas sector depends on the market price. It always has. 

There remains one industry in Canada where pricing is stable, and family producers live in relative financial stability: Dairy.

3488 2018-12-19 18:33:51 Getting an oil change on a conference call was not my best idea, the dudes at the lobby really think I’m talking to them about finance charges w/ headphones on? Y’all dumb

3490 2018-12-19 18:33:40 Oil and gas producer goes forward trying to increase capacity to produce - and deliver - despite the price of the product has dropped. 

You can only sustain a profit this way if the market price for your product is higher than the cost to produce.
3491 2018-12-19 18:33:39 Edgy opinion: Curt Schilling, Barry Bonds, and Roger Clemens all belong in the Hall of Fame. Character doesn't matter unless you want to go back and remove Ty Cobb, Charles Comiskey, and a litany of other people in the Hall with abhorrent beliefs.

Gross.
3494 2018-12-19 18:33:26 Too bad the redtape still has the oil pipelines & related entangled! Canada (& Alberta) suffers at the hands of Trudeau liberalism!

3499 2018-12-19 18:32:41 Also the mental gymnastics to try and workaround the fact that ISIS had 2/3 of their territory taken by the SDF including their oil refineries yet somehow give Russia the vast majority of the credit

3505 2018-12-19 18:32:15 have you no shame sir ? You keep auditioning to be the PM of oil and gas . have you heard anything about the climate catastrophe looming ? Is oil and gas more important than people . dont oil and gas industry have CEO's to speak on their behalf ? We deserve better !
3506 2018-12-19 18:32:14 Interesting. I'll have to do some research on hardship waivers. I haven't dealt with one, but it sounds like it will have an impact on Crude Oil and $USO
3507 2018-12-19 18:32:14 @Shehzad_Ind don't mislead us...first of all this govt got the benefit of tax collected from 400% increase in excise as the crude oil rates gone down when they came to power...if tax collection has gone up..is there any allocation in the budget??
3508 2018-12-19 18:32:09 I’m not a big fan of the smell but I love motor oil smell
3509 2018-12-19 18:32:04 This really does break my Star-Spangled heart. Is this really cool, America? Are we fine ceding our power for a tax break and cheaper oil? What has happened to us, America?
3510 2018-12-19 18:32:00 i might consider getting a boyfriend just so he can fix my car and tell me when to get an oil change
3511 2018-12-19 18:31:49 The Saudi U.S. relationship has been troubling for decades, but Trump has made it painfully obvious that money/ oil has perverted our basic moral compass.
3512 2018-12-19 18:31:44 This is why it’s important to buy large quantities of survival food and hoard gold, guns and toilet paper. 

But what do we do when they stop beta testing the chemtrails and begin dropping black oil virus infected bees on top of flyover America?

3514 2018-12-19 18:31:34 In your dreams only as number proof the opposite .. Saudi Arabia‘s economy didn’t collapse even when oil prices reached ~34$ .. the deficit is lower than last year while achieving a higher GDP ..
3515 2018-12-19 18:31:33 @CDCgov 
HOW ARE ALBINO MEN & WOMEN? WHAT DOES PLATINUM, SILVER & COPPER AS EG. GOLD BULLION DUST DO TO EFFECT HEALTH WHEN IT BECOMES SEDIMENT IN OLIVE OIL BOTTLES? WHEN USED TO TREAT SEVERE SKIN BURNS FROM EXPOSURE TO FLAMES OR CURE LEPROSY WHEN RUBBED ON SKIN. VALUE IN WINE?

3517 2018-12-19 18:31:27 Yeah, America decided to ban tankers in North BC coast, killing Northern Gateway, and America through its French Province, Quebec, is not accepting oil from Alberta. And America through its Canadian judicial branch its blocking TMX. Though, America is printing money, our money.
3518 2018-12-19 18:31:20 The last Republican administration was so much better.  At least then,  US foreign policy was sold to DOMESTIC oil and gas interests and not foreign ones.  So classy, what great times during the Bush years.
3519 2018-12-19 18:31:18 These guys all make up the support network for the oil industry!
3520 2018-12-19 18:31:16 Here's another thing I'm sure will spark some debate. My ma never puts oil in the water to cook pasta, only salt.
3521 2018-12-19 18:31:03 No. Customers provide the fuel for the visionary. He is stressed already from short sellers and corrupt press fueled by Big Oil. WHY add to it with relatively SMALL insignificant concerns like this? More critical than ever we support and show love for the mission

3527 2018-12-19 18:30:35 Here's a comment from someone who made my oil.

It's so strong and good, slows me down opens my lungs, softens my mood, helps me make better food choices!
3528 2018-12-19 18:30:34 Two Orange Snowmen off to an oil rig in the North Sea, two off to Manitoba and one to GUATEMALA!!!
3529 2018-12-19 18:30:31 Oil prices actually 56 Usd some months back it was 75 Usd.
3530 2018-12-19 18:30:01 Buy Beard Oil stocks now guys! You heard it here first!
3531 2018-12-19 18:29:59 Yeah....you may be right...but the non-oil sector, an estimated 60%, is dependent on the performance of the oil sector...so where oil goes, the economy goes largely. You need an exceptional growth in non-oil sector to reverse that trend
3532 2018-12-19 18:29:56 When you look at the facts the complaints from AB are motivated by corporate greed not reality. The taps were never turned off. The oil flows 24/7. They just want more of it to flow so shareholders get more profit. Not about jobs. Not about Canada letting AB down. Wake up Canada
3533 2018-12-19 18:29:48 With oil price dropping to below $50 over the last week expect worse if that situation persist
3534 2018-12-19 18:29:47 Snake oil salesman
3535 2018-12-19 18:29:35 Actually, the USA is the world's largest exporter of oil in the world right now.  Just, fyi in the best way possible. 
3536 2018-12-19 18:29:28 If "data is the new oil", are privacy violations the new climate change?
3537 2018-12-19 18:28:55 "it's a tough gig... But hey this is all tough"... you've watched too many movies.. You want to try working on a trawler or oil rig or be in a foxhole somewhere getting shot at - get real - you sit on your arses, talk, get a good wage and collect expenses ffs
3538 2018-12-19 18:28:54 my raynaud's makes it hard af to walk so i'm getting more plasters & healing oil from this etsy seller that makes it for that condition thank god
3539 2018-12-19 18:28:47 Keep in mind that Emblem has barely any production capacity on their own. Most of it will come from $APHA, while they focus on oil and other derivatives which they will export to Germany and their own market. How much is that worth?
3540 2018-12-19 18:28:39 Mum use to say u hv to stop this so your wife won't be scared of touching your stuff.
But I invest it positively into keeping files n d rest.
3541 2018-12-19 18:28:38 When the value of a commodity/stock is falling there is a sense that you should sell now before it gets worse (for oil companies its pump and sell). Some may assume that prices will rise and they can cash in later and hold on to their reserves. But the future is uncertain.
3542 2018-12-19 18:28:37 Canadians NEED to call their MLA's and demand action!  Our leaders are NOT working in the National interest of Canadians.  
They are working to support Banks (@RBC) and Oil and Gas Sector needs!

NO Confidence Vote needed in the @OurCommons
3543 2018-12-19 18:28:29 Once we break the deal the Saudis won't allow us access to their oil 
3544 2018-12-19 18:28:24 @VelshiRuhle Ali of course Congress can regulate it it’s about wanting to and finding the people necessary to guide them in the right direction it’s easy as 123. It’s about the will to do it. Wealthy have to be regulated. Be at big banks big tech big oil big gas. Wake up citizens
3545 2018-12-19 18:28:11 With bitter kola and plan oil
Don't forget..
3546 2018-12-19 18:28:11 I’m getting my car’s oil changed, and the mechanic told me to “pull behind the Nissan”. 
Considering how little I know about cars, I’ve never been more horrified
3547 2018-12-19 18:28:00 tell me why we are still buying oil from other countries to the tune of #Billions? we have the dam stuff here already...like selling our beans for beans only to buy em back for #MegaBucks...lol, please, tell #US why? you're so smart....
3548 2018-12-19 18:27:50 This nigga knocked over my damn oil burner on the carpet i just can’t like how didn’t u see it
3549 2018-12-19 18:27:49 More refined products are not as explosive, corrosive, or environmentally dangerous as dilbit. If AB came halfway, maybe BC would agree.

So why aren't the mega-rich oil & gas companies not helping their own workers, and not looking at further refining their product?
3550 2018-12-19 18:27:46 Syria should be prepared for the possible offensive against SDF if they reject handing over Raqqa + Omar oil fields.
3551 2018-12-19 18:27:40 Seems the strategy worked to raise our oil offset not weeks ago.
3552 2018-12-19 18:27:35 Don't worry paul ryan will come back as a lobbyist for the Koch's and lobby for oil barrens and corporations that want to have complete control over  our environment, for short term profits, he will go down as one of the worst house speakers ever, expose him
3553 2018-12-19 18:27:34 The global coal market isn’t really global. It’s not like oil at all
3554 2018-12-19 18:27:18 This doesn’t matter. Fundamentals, revenues, profits, etc. of individual producers do not matter at all. They will all rise or fall with oil prices. There’s no point in analyzing any one company. The only exception is those with heavy debt might go bankrupt while others survive.
3555 2018-12-19 18:27:14 @MarkRober from one engineer to another, can you provide advise on how you identify and select your projects?  Honestly your YouTube channel has inspired me to do something fun and brain jogging outside of my everyday instrument and control engineering in the oil and gas biz.
3556 2018-12-19 18:27:11 I really wanna shoot D'Angelo's "How does it feel" wit about 4 dudes. I would need a few ladies on set to oil down the men tho. Shiiiid, I ain't doing that. That's  where my directing STOPS!!! 

FOH!!!
3557 2018-12-19 18:27:04 @frankiemacd Are You In The Pocket Of Big Oil.
3558 2018-12-19 18:27:02 Now that the ISIS collaboration was fruitful in getting all the oil out through Turkey there’s nothing left to take.
3559 2018-12-19 18:27:00 Getting my oil topped off without my dad having to remind me was peak adulting
3560 2018-12-19 18:27:00 Someone just made +14.19% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 47.634 → 47.296 (20x leverage)  ~ OOOULALA $WTICO $USD
3561 2018-12-19 18:26:53 Scheer claims that Quebec uses mostly Saudi oil is INCORRECT. 44% of  comes form Western Canada, thanks to the reversal of lin e9.  And 37% from the USA.  However In NB Irving oil owned by Peter Mackay family gets 38% of their crude from the  Middle East.
3562 2018-12-19 18:26:39 I ran away from a war with an army convoy, thank goodness we weren't killed. They nearly killed us and now everyone is short of cooking oil and petrol, while I'm entertaining your mental illness. I'd love to be kinder, but if you want to be a fool, you're fair game. Live. Learn.
3563 2018-12-19 18:26:31 Dripping in Palm oil...
3564 2018-12-19 18:26:29 Lots of olive oil or MCT oil drizzled on salads (with cucumbers, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, pumpkin seeds, can also add chicken), good fat transport mechanism. The Costco jars of mixed nuts are great snacks too.
3565 2018-12-19 18:26:21 Don't know what Y&R is thinking! I DO know 2 things... 1) U shouldn't have been let go! 2) They are losing fans quicker than an old Chevy loses oil! What happened to the show's HISTORY? If the writers can't write u a story, THEY are the ones who need to be let go!
3566 2018-12-19 18:26:15 @LidlUK - I’ve noticed that your Newgate chicken gravy granules contains palm oil... Could you tell me if it’s from a sustainable source...?
3567 2018-12-19 18:26:11 Just because they're men. Second because of the oil work. Man hating feminists are the worst.
3568 2018-12-19 18:26:08 Oil looks good for short $DWT
3569 2018-12-19 18:26:07 Maybe you should tell her how George Washington did not use his 1st Amendment defeat the Brit's he used the 2nd Amendment.. Or Maybe how Wilson cut off the JAPS oil so Japan would attack us. Or how he wilson was told not put all the ships in one port.
3570 2018-12-19 18:26:03 Getting an oil change and decided to drink half my pre workout bottle bc i was thirsty n boy lemme tell ya not a good idea I feel like I wanna rip a couch cushion in half but nope we’re jus here.... in jiffy lube... thinkin bout ripping things in half 
3571 2018-12-19 18:25:51 No joke, I knew people who thought that they were being smart and saving so much money by trying to get the most calories per dollar by eating nothing but rice, beans, and vegetable oil. It didn't look like it went well for any of them. Meat doesn't cost that much...
3572 2018-12-19 18:25:50 time to nationalize oil? #IthinkSo #NoLogic
3573 2018-12-19 18:25:49 Grand. As the Vikings have been drawing down from their oil fund recently (that is what it is there for) I can only assume that expenditure is not matching income.
3574 2018-12-19 18:25:45 先輩達深夜3:00でも平気で研究室いたりするし、研究室のこと先輩のリスポーン地点って呼んでる
3575 2018-12-19 18:25:42 ラモスのスイッチ入って攻撃参加する動き好き
3576 2018-12-19 18:25:38 Pathetic... The offensive should be launched against these traitors immediately if they reject handing over Raqqa and Omar oil fields to the Syrian government.
3577 2018-12-19 18:25:34 Why would America have to wait for the Russians to call them out in order to start attacking ISIS oil infrastructure?

ISIS oil trade was thriving at the time the Russians finally got involved. Why would America allow this??

I already know why Turkey would.  Why America?
3578 2018-12-19 18:25:28 Wake up and make your money. 
Went to go ship our Prime Apparel orders 
Get oil change
Hit the gym!
3579 2018-12-19 18:25:26 We get oil from bad people too! Right!
3580 2018-12-19 18:25:20 Basically yes, plumbers also work with gas and oil lines and in this class I'm learning the whole spectrum
3581 2018-12-19 18:25:17 Lol. Commodities. And oil isn’t?  Beef? SB?
3582 2018-12-19 18:25:07 Oil AND lotion in these streetsss

3584 2018-12-19 18:24:59 Yeah, that makes sense! They evoke so many art feels in me, especially as I just visited the Barnes art museum in Philadelphia, and much of the work there (including in the temporary exhibit - "Berthe Morisot, woman impressionist") is oil paintings of such diverse variety :)
3585 2018-12-19 18:24:42 真夜中のこの時間帯の大学って何か出そうだし不気味で怖いなぁと思ってたけど普通に研究室に先輩いてさらに怖くなった
3586 2018-12-19 18:24:40 An unfortunate reality. Sadly. Perhaps that has something to do with their lineage. They were, after all, marketed to people that wanted ‘the great British sports car’ without the oil leaks and unreliability
3587 2018-12-19 18:24:38 Trump shown his power, as #Rothschild and his gang of thugs wanted to drill the pristine oil reserves.
3588 2018-12-19 18:24:29 How did you get ban pipelines from anything I’ve said? I’m saying don’t subsidize Chinese oil sales with taxpayer money.
3589 2018-12-19 18:24:16 I'm literally burning my midnight oil watching youtube videos and I have no regrets :v
3590 2018-12-19 18:24:02 Idiot know-nothings are busy trying to denounce this as "the end system" and a failure.  Big oil propaganda....?
3591 2018-12-19 18:23:58 Pm: boscia cleansing oil if I wear makeup, Peter Thomas Roth acne cleanser. Fresh black tea kombucha essence. Drunk elephant tlc serum with b-hydra. Auto correct eye cream and protini moisturizer

3593 2018-12-19 18:23:51  here I go again with my big oil’ heart.
3594 2018-12-19 18:23:50 both the hailers and boos have disgrace Nigeria in the eyes of the world, we have perfectly and fantastically show our immaturity. Meanwhile I respect the president for his statesmanship
3595 2018-12-19 18:23:50 Well, Nicola sturgeon, the non existent oil in the Clyde, wanting independence only to want to join a larger union, erm starting off as a fledgling independent country. Name one from the past three decades that's financially stable. Nicola sturgeon.
3596 2018-12-19 18:23:46 Let’s build a grain pipeline coast to coast, since rail lines are full of oil. Maybe let’s double it so we can get Quebec’s milk out west faster too.  But let’s build it to the highest code. So we can convert it to canola oil if need be.
3597 2018-12-19 18:23:44 It's 2018, almost 2019.

How is sourcing responsible products such a difficult thing? We coscientiously decide to not buy blood diamonds, why are we buying conflict oil?
3598 2018-12-19 18:23:41 By the straw polls taken from Quebec, it appears as though the people of Quebec have no issues with Canadian oil - actually preferring it. Makes you wonder why the so-called “leaders” seem so opposed...? #followthemoney
3599 2018-12-19 18:23:39 I make my own, an' they all smell like assault rifle oil.
3600 2018-12-19 18:23:36 Charles Lister is now in panic mode with the US leaving Syria he'll see his funded cut to next to nothing. Right after the MEI lost funding from the Saudli regime. They will now lose funding from NATO/ banks/ oil firms/ arms dealers/ Qatar and the Corp media attention. You lost.
3601 2018-12-19 18:23:35 also snake oil
3602 2018-12-19 18:23:35 it works because green text and olive oil are green
3603 2018-12-19 18:23:11 Support Alberta Oil.
3604 2018-12-19 18:23:07 Ratt you whiners why did your government do nothing when oil was at highest ever  .you were content to get the monies screw development right ?
3605 2018-12-19 18:23:06 Been dodging a oil change for 2weeks
3606 2018-12-19 18:23:03 nooooo, it's delish, you can do little rabbit chops, rubbed with olive oil, garlic and sage or thyme and quickly griddled on a bbq, or rabbit in red wine with chocolate, or stifado a classic Greek dish, it's totally adaptable
3607 2018-12-19 18:22:45 Lmao that’s all I use that almost seems like it’s trying to work .. tea tree oil, but if your skin is sensitive, try diluting it with jojoba oil & witch hazel.
3608 2018-12-19 18:22:35 I sure as fuck know more about oil that you.
3609 2018-12-19 18:22:25 I certainly hope that you investigate medical cannabis OIL as a treatment for patient pain issues it works better then any opiod ever could
3610 2018-12-19 18:22:18 If what we are trying to achieve is protecting oil, then that would be worth the lives of thousands of troops and billions of dollars. Energy security is very important, and we've sacrificed troops and money in the past to achieve it.
3611 2018-12-19 18:22:09 Not sure what supernatural force is controlling me today but I started an oil painting for the first time in 70 years
3612 2018-12-19 18:22:07 oil of every pearls uninsides is sO GOOD DUDE!!!!! I’d go so hard if I ever saw sophie live. you should listen to the new @thelegofgrandma album, she produced a couple tracks on there and it’s awesome
3613 2018-12-19 18:22:02 Nah Black Seed Oil really might be the goat. It’s disgusting but it works.
3614 2018-12-19 18:21:58 Hot oil over my hand  it kills 
3615 2018-12-19 18:21:56 Seems Energy East was about bypassing Montreal Quebec refinery, which now  is doing great after the reversal of line 9.  To build a new one directly to NB Irving Oil, I believe owned by former CPC cabinet Minister Peter Mackay & family.  ...
3616 2018-12-19 18:21:56 Senators: Please ban us (and our colleagues) from trading stocks: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ! ESPECIALLY "OIL" STOCKS, HUH !! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !
3617 2018-12-19 18:21:55 What would that be? Big oil has screwed us for years coupled with 50 years of poorly managed resources by conservatives and now depressed market prices. This is all Justins fault. Is that your message?
3618 2018-12-19 18:21:53 Disgusting thought.  I’d rather look at an oil rendition of my ex.
3619 2018-12-19 18:21:53 Paul - Spot on and one of the few other people that I have seen that understand "why". Lithium/minerals potential. Same historical playbook followed in the middle-east with Oil. China chose Africa for their resource pursuit.
3620 2018-12-19 18:21:51 My silver oud perfume oil aged so well. I smell rich and luxurious. It was definitely worth waiting for.
3621 2018-12-19 18:21:44 My son lives in Dubai... told me yesterday that a recession has started... I asked why and he answered "oil prices"...
3622 2018-12-19 18:21:39 But Jason Kenney supports them. I assume somehow the low oil price is linked to gay kids in his mind.
3623 2018-12-19 18:21:32 Vajay more powerful than pastor's anointing oil for visa
3624 2018-12-19 18:21:27 He works for Putin so much, that he no longer wants to use his oil, or he’ll blow up Russian soldiers in Syria. Yea, he’s real buddies with Vlad! 
3625 2018-12-19 18:21:27 How do CVS and Walgreens both don’t have body oil? All this damn lotion, and not one thing of baby oil smh
3626 2018-12-19 18:21:26 The Alberta oil lobby has spent the last few weeks whipping up oil crisis hysteria and blaming it on the Feds. Liberals are greasing the squeaky wheel.
3627 2018-12-19 18:21:24 Your argument is intellectually incoherent. Either oil wealth is responsible or it is not. If it is then ALL oil wealth should be forfeit, not only the folks you don't like. 

That fortune is oil wealth plain and simple and should be viewed as part of the potential compensation
3628 2018-12-19 18:21:20 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
3629 2018-12-19 18:21:18 Glen said “I got you an oil change and 2 new tires now go wash this motherfucker”  I’m weak my car is filtyyyyy.
3630 2018-12-19 18:21:18 Or that somehow being part of a foreign country would make it easier to get oil to tidewater given our VAST ALBERTA COASTLINE.

3633 2018-12-19 18:21:08 In regards to nail care. Do you still use nail oil pens you made yourself? Is it still jojoba oil and vitamin e or do you put anything else?
3634 2018-12-19 18:21:08 #ImMrMeseeks #LookAtMe Russia loves Germany entering into contracts that make them completely depending on Russia's oil and Russia loves Canada refusing to drill. Russia does not love Trump enabling America to produce as much oil as possible
3635 2018-12-19 18:21:02 Tunisia is the world's second largest producer of olive oil, after Spain.
3636 2018-12-19 18:20:59 No coffee gives me upset stomach Diarrhea very badly just one cup.
It's not caffeine at all Tea has a lot doesn't bother me. 
The problem is the oil in the beans goes through me like shit through a tin goose. LOL
3637 2018-12-19 18:20:53 going to be a blockbuster season for beard oil sales this year
3638 2018-12-19 18:20:48 Something happening in Dundee behind the scenes, oil rigs at the docs, v&a, new train station, millions on waterfront, potentially tallest building in Scotland to be built, tones of new houses 
3639 2018-12-19 18:20:47 Don’t make me laugh...that report was spawned in 2007...you haven’t a clue about the oil industry!
3640 2018-12-19 18:20:47 You realize the federal government subsidized medical care, education, social services, electricity and oil amungst a few items in your life that you aren't paying 100% for?

If you're bit in favour of government handouts, be prepared to pay more for.... Everything.
3641 2018-12-19 18:20:43 Russian involvement in the conflict cost Turkey a lot of cheap ISIS oil.
3642 2018-12-19 18:20:42 U.S is only there because they’re in control of Syria’s oil fields illegally. The U.S was never invited by Syria. They need to leave.
3643 2018-12-19 18:20:35 I can’t deny that, but, what happens next is three more bad years in Alberta, then transfer payments have to start coming back the other way, and they can’t, because there is nothing there. Phasing out oil is the answer, doing it overnight, is not. That’s all I am saying
3644 2018-12-19 18:20:33 Tab hi oil churra kar le kar ja rahay hain
3645 2018-12-19 18:20:28 Placebo or not, it makes me feel better and the oil clears my nostrils anyway LOL
3646 2018-12-19 18:20:23 As I told you before; Syria will restore control over the oil fields and the city of Raqqa.
3647 2018-12-19 18:20:05 got my oil changed and a new headlight my car is a new woman
3648 2018-12-19 18:19:58 Boil ground raw pepper in water for a while, add the grated okra and stir 
Add locust beans, meat, palm oil and everything else you want to add
3649 2018-12-19 18:19:58 Can't wait until the global agriculture system collapses because of climate change and we all starve to death while y'all are still trying to prop up the oil industry so your bosses can keep getting more rich

3651 2018-12-19 18:19:35 I love to flex on ppl that I can change the oil in a car even tho it’s not a difficult task at all. Someone could be like “looks like my backseat is a little dirty” and I’ll be like “well get me a filter and some oil and I can fix that right up for you”

3655 2018-12-19 18:19:05 Didn't they remove a company as well - oil?

3658 2018-12-19 18:18:51 A certain moderation is needed in today's hot house political climate where raw emotionalism is trying to displace political reason as the basis for our public domain. 
We need more oil upon the water than gasoline on the fire.
3659 2018-12-19 18:18:31 This same Ph that I live in? 

Have you heard of Choba? Aluu? Ozuoba? Rumuola? Wimpy? Ogbogoro? Rumuosi?

How about the pickpockets & cultists hovering around Rumuokoro? 

But you see these places I called have nothing on the rascals at Mile 1/2/3 & Oil Mill.

3661 2018-12-19 18:18:29 Do you really think that trump was fighting ISIS? Why in the hell trump would care about Syria? He only cares about oil and israel.
3662 2018-12-19 18:18:26 Ur cat is the main ingredient tho dont u think we will use her as oil
3663 2018-12-19 18:18:25 Or that they'll be able to teleport the oil there rather than pipe it or truck it through Canadian territory, where the tariffs will flow like rain

3666 2018-12-19 18:18:03 Recent survey says 70% of people in Quebec prefer buying oil from western Canada instead of USA or Saudi Arabia. Then why aren’t there Pipeline Rallies happening in QC? @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ #EnergyEast #cdnpoli
3667 2018-12-19 18:18:02 Oil as the underlying factor. It seems oil and defense do localized recessions and housing does big ones.
3668 2018-12-19 18:17:59 Hemp oil usually don’t come in many different types, except peppermint. But essential oils there’s all kinds and I use them all for different things
3669 2018-12-19 18:17:55 Of course it stands to reason that SDF would benefit from direct Russian involvement.

ISIS was finally getting bombed... their installations, their oil convoys, etc.

That was not happening prior to Sept 30, 2015. And it showed.
3670 2018-12-19 18:17:54 It was! Lol :) I should have sautéed the dehydrated chopped onions a bit more in the olive oil/butter but I was too impatient for it to be done.

3672 2018-12-19 18:17:40 "Grass Roots" fertilized by the Tides Foundation and other mystery money is laughable. Telling companies where to buy their oil is also unacceptable.  Quebec gladly accepts billions in transfer payments from the west why not the oil?
3673 2018-12-19 18:17:33 But the oil companies want to sell you something and make money. If you have an #EV and solar they can’t make a profit. Selling you hydrogen they can and burn oil to make it.
3674 2018-12-19 18:17:33 46?! Wow you look good. My wife too. She’s 66 and has great Italian genes and oil of olay...

3676 2018-12-19 18:17:27 Typical  propagandizing for Liberals.
You claim 'Some provinces have easier time raising revenue than other'.  
@Justintrudeau renewed the Que. favouring formula a YEAR early!  He knew that with his deliberate destruction of oil/gas industry, Alberta would be a have-not ths yr.!
3677 2018-12-19 18:17:26 By that logic we should remove everyone involved in segregation, not to mention Ty Cobb and a litany of other players with abhorant beliefs. Bonds and Clemens and Schilling all belong there. The character thing is silly.
3678 2018-12-19 18:17:22 And obscures it in service of defending his SWF as obviously the only form state ownership (“socialism”?) can take, i.e. owning Amazon and distributing profits like Alaska distributes oil checks or something
3679 2018-12-19 18:17:21 Lol I have all that. But what beard oil you use? I use a balm mainly
3680 2018-12-19 18:17:19 The earth's population is projected to hit 9.0 billion by 2040. Oil consumption is expected to rise between 27 and 35% by then. As you say, someone is going to supply it. Why not Canada? We are more exo-friendly than most oil producing nations.
3681 2018-12-19 18:17:12 I don't care if we won't have Lucas Oil stuff, but I want enough tracks to make my "Rainbow Oil Championship", you know? At least 12 tracks, it would be beautiful!

3685 2018-12-19 18:16:36 Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company with 20 billion in profits last year, got a small refinery exemption for 2017, sources tell us.
3686 2018-12-19 18:16:36 Do you disagree that Alberta, all of the oil producing Provinces and Territories, and the Canadian Governments (successive governments over a long period of time), should have worked together to create a version of the Norway Oil Fund?
3687 2018-12-19 18:16:30 Ok so the soft body oil from Victoria secret is so amazing. I want to find a black owned company that offers a soft body oil that’s similar because this is a necessity.

3691 2018-12-19 18:16:12 Just come home to the news my Mum is stockpiling olive oil ‘because of brexit.’ We may have a no deal but our house is fully stocked of kalamarta olives.
3692 2018-12-19 18:16:05 You think global consumption of oil is going to go down over the next 10 years? 

Please send whatever drugs you are on to us out west. We could use a laugh.

3714 2018-12-19 18:14:28 2. The market is signalling that it's time to phase out oil. Demand for oil is *rising*, not diminishing.

I love green energy and all, but it's not paying the bills. At least not yet.
3715 2018-12-19 18:14:25 So uproar for calling someone stupid woman,rape clause, universal credit,fishing rights,oil, selling out Scotland, constant cover  up's the list is endless,I would say that was rather polite
3716 2018-12-19 18:14:24 I know, but I was actually surprised at this one. Mother-in-law was looking for a palm oil free one and I was like 'Iceland, they did that advert that wasn't an advert'. Apparently by 2019 all Iceland own brand products will be palm oil free...
3717 2018-12-19 18:14:22 Treating unemployed oil workers like children to be lectured is an example of Nenshi's go-to style.

3720 2018-12-19 18:13:44 #oiltrains w/ oil & bitumen compartmentalized into upgraded, modern containers are preferable to pipelines that, when they leak, spew oil for ages until the exact location is found & it’s shut down. And I say that as one who lives 1-1/2 blocks from a rail line carrying these.
3721 2018-12-19 18:13:43 Fossil fuel mafia has made billions out of oil sands, why aren’t they helping workers that help them rack money faster than they can hide

3723 2018-12-19 18:13:30 Two more thoughts on oil:

1. If now is the time to phase out oil, what's the country's plan to pay for the massive social benefit packages being introduced in Ottawa? Tax the rich? The rich already pay about 90% of the country's income taxes.
3724 2018-12-19 18:13:24 2/2 only mention of cause was price of oil going down, but no one questioned why we don’t see the same results in other oil producing countries.
3725 2018-12-19 18:13:23 Yes, mainly by coalition air strikes and the rapid advance from the Syrian Democratic Forces to take ISIS centers of commerce and oil production.
3726 2018-12-19 18:13:22 Anyone else annoyed at the diagram showing oil leaving the refinery to be used as transportation fuels? It's not that hard to get the terminology right...
3727 2018-12-19 18:13:19 As much as I enjoy having a vehicle and all the oil powered conveniences, I hesitate to think that this is the optimal way for efficiency. Do you know of any books that cover this topic?

3730 2018-12-19 18:13:04 How about they pay for all of their costs?  I think we’d be more than happy to get rid of the oil industry if we had other viable options here...
3731 2018-12-19 18:12:57 That’s funny right there. Might want to oil your caps-lock key. Tweets aren’t proof.

3733 2018-12-19 18:12:49 Putin just wants an oil pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea...and he looks like he's going to have it soon.
3734 2018-12-19 18:12:47 I hope step two is fighting those individuals who funded or supplied weapons to ISIS. Easy to find out where all that stolen oil went. Putin knew who was buying it. Guess the Russian intel is better than our own CIA or Brittons MI6.
3735 2018-12-19 18:12:46 I never said "Washington was completely oblivious" what I'm stating is, that it wasn't Washington who set it up and benefitted from it, it was Turkey. Laughably naive is asserting the U.S bought oil from ISIS to come and fight the U.S because that makes a whole lot of sense.
3736 2018-12-19 18:12:36 I’m getting an oil change so y’all can stop with the sub tweets

3775 2018-12-19 18:08:40 Not what I'm arguing at all, what I'm arguing is that Turkey has had the proximity of this situation to their benefit. What im saying is that Erdoğan wasn't a fall guy for Washington buying oil from ISIS, it was him doing it by himself.

3787 2018-12-19 18:07:39 lol women dont believe in oil changes

3790 2018-12-19 18:07:32 Roast it with olive oil, garlic and red chili flakes or purée for non-carb mashed potatoes. Guess it’s polenta for Holiday dinner.
3791 2018-12-19 18:07:29 How is it hypocrisy when he’s had to buy to sell? Ain’t got all that oil money to piss up the wall
3792 2018-12-19 18:07:27 US crooked foreign policy people were looking the other way while Turks lined their pockets with dirty ISIS oil money. Of course, Washington had its own stake in this dirty business.

Russia blew the whistle and bombed the shit out of the oil routes. They deserve credit for it...
3793 2018-12-19 18:07:25 Just rubbed my eye with my housecoat that’s covered in olbas oil  I will be drowning in my tears if you are looking for me
3794 2018-12-19 18:07:21 What LesdaChef said about Extra Virgin olive oil this week was hurtful. I just remembered.

3796 2018-12-19 18:07:11 Topped off a pretty mediocre almost-bad-day by staining my favourite white top with red oil...
3797 2018-12-19 18:07:10 Serious question?  Who is Big Oil for you?  Exxon or Aramco?  Private or nationalized?
3798 2018-12-19 18:06:57 It's a trickle down affect. Glad you're happy looking out for yourself. If Alberta oil industry succeeds so does the rest of Canada.
3799 2018-12-19 18:06:19 Can any #Berts see us appointing Dickov when the oil runs out ?  ..... precisely
3800 2018-12-19 18:06:18 "Saudi Arabia Is Going Bankrupt" Taleb Exclaims After Seeing Kingdom's Latest Budget
 
For Saudi Arabia to be able to meet its projected budget, it will need oil prices to rise higher. Much higher.

3802 2018-12-19 18:06:08 You can't actually believe that Erdogan's son Bilal was laundering all that ISIS oil money without Washington's knowledge.... do you actually believe that??
3803 2018-12-19 18:06:03 It’s not just Palm Oil, Soya, mung bean etc. Non of us use this planet for food production without leaving a very heavy footprint, mass production of anything is bad. The loss of decent local food & seasonal shopping especially for fruit and veg carries a very heavy price.
3804 2018-12-19 18:06:02 Brought my car to get an oil change & Tire rotation & I can’t help but Admire the beauty in my Jeep. I wouldnt trade it for anything 
3805 2018-12-19 18:05:45 Where can I go get a quick oil change from where I don’t gotta make a damn appt? I ain’t trynna drive to woodmans that’s far b lol
3806 2018-12-19 18:05:21 Yeah, also, freaking SAFETY HAZARD? Oil is leaking! That has to be a fire code violation
3807 2018-12-19 18:05:12 Have you tried gamma ray and neck oil?
3808 2018-12-19 18:05:12 Also like dissolves like. So for deep cleansing and exfoliation, it's much better to use oil but not just any oil. Argan oil is better like I said from our previous reply, it's non comedogenic, dries quickly and maintains moisture well enough.
3809 2018-12-19 18:05:11 UD ACW Somerville Ma. interior companies reporting a oil burner issue now..
3810 2018-12-19 18:05:07 Oil money isn't blood money.

Especially when it fuels the equalization process for the Have-Not provinces.

3816 2018-12-19 18:04:07 It took you so long to come up with this..
Guess you went to get your research properly..

I can categorically state that the Pentecostal hub has never mocked anything that had to do with 'brisk trade' especially oils. Oil has been the symbol of anointing and Power from the bible
3817 2018-12-19 18:04:04 All the most quoted AGW deniers are not climate scientists.  Most of them get money from think tanks that are funded by Big Oil & Gas.  Why can't any of you name your top books, videos, scientists, organizations you trust?

3824 2018-12-19 18:03:38 You’re not wrong but I’ll tell you what smells even better, Castrol R 2 stroke oil. Brings back memories.
3825 2018-12-19 18:03:34 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.

3827 2018-12-19 18:03:27 Fuck gas money, can u put sum on my oil change or my tire rotation? Cars just don’t run off of gas
3828 2018-12-19 18:03:25 I never said Russia was interested in occupying Northern Syria. I said ISIS caliphate was at its very largest as of Sept 30, 2015... and only shrunk from thereafter. That's a fact.

Russian bombing campaign helped destroy ISIS oil trade, speeding the terrorist caliphate's demise.
3829 2018-12-19 18:03:22 Really strange then that the BCC & many oil companies support the carbon tax. I'm betting that one day Scheer will have to reveal the dark US money that props up him & the CPC.
3830 2018-12-19 18:03:03 My car is running so smooth now that my lazy ass got an oil change.
3831 2018-12-19 18:02:59 Never saw a press conference of him being questioned on the scams that came into light after 2012. And what economics are we talking here? The fact that inflation in country was directly related to international oil prices? To keep the poor as it is so they don't ask for more?

3833 2018-12-19 18:02:54 Calamity has not struck the entire country. When we see Agri production has gone up. Prices across are stable iro rice, cereal pulses.etc..oil seeds too. Then the issue is cost of production. If we can support the farmer here , the latter will not ask waiver

this is nice
3835 2018-12-19 18:02:40 It's good you can come on here and say that shes stupid.... Although I'd wager a pound to penny that shes significantly more intelligent than YOU.
3836 2018-12-19 18:02:38 Oily face isn't a problem. What's important is that you get your hands on an organic oil that's non comedogenic(unable to clog pores). So with argan oil,your pores aren't getting clogged and it maintains the levels of natural oils in the skin so you don't break out(acne,pimples)
3837 2018-12-19 18:02:37 Going in for an oil change and tire rotation today! Can’t wait to spend way too much time there, get taken advantage of and scammed in to paying for extra unnecessary services, and ultimately have my Father be severely disappointed in me!!!!

3851 2018-12-19 18:01:14 The answer is not buying a pipeline, giving oil companies billions and pretending to be a climate leader at election time. Start there and we can talk.
3852 2018-12-19 18:01:12 Have you tried steaming? Fill a bowl up with water from the kettle put a few drops of something like vicks or olbas oil in it, sit over it with a towel on your head to keep the steam in! Really helps me to clear up a cold 
3853 2018-12-19 18:01:10 If I was a parent for a child in that class, I would chocked having someone come in and lie to them? What does this accomplish. Poor kids being told not to believe in their best interest, must be a con thing. Mind you big oil has been manipulating AB forever.
3854 2018-12-19 18:01:03 Crud oil price has been deeply fallen in international market from 73 USD to 45 USD but only 9 rupees reduced here instead of Rs 25 . Corperates looting to innocent people's ignorance by the cooperation of Modi Goverment . It deserves strong agitation against this looting !

3864 2018-12-19 18:00:13 I see the beauty in the rain.. I can see the joy in the pain.. Silver lining I was brought up, sometimes I’m feeling spoiled in my brain.. true colors like oil in the rain..
3865 2018-12-19 18:00:04 I wonder if this will stop the USA from still pumping away free oil from Iraq in return for destroying their country & murdering 150,000 people for no reason? Apparently Saddam was evil because he killed Iraqis...
3866 2018-12-19 17:59:58 Most vegan foods contain palm oil? News to me. Seems like it’s a very common ingredient in all sorts of food, sure, don’t know what it has to do with whether raising billions of animals to suffer and die each year is a good idea or not.

Israel gets to keep Golan Heights & the massive oil found there #GenieEnergy 

Russia & Turkey control the rest?  #Pipeline 

Saudi’s get nuclear 

Democratic countries get the refugees which will be weaponized by Putin pushing populism
3870 2018-12-19 17:59:33 .also triple digit prices on barrels of oil
3871 2018-12-19 17:59:31 According to the shop that rotated my tires and changed my oil i need shocks and struts. Also, it is expensive :(
3872 2018-12-19 17:59:24 Government has killed the oil industry in Alberta  a major oil producer in Canada.  revenues were huge for Canadian economy that relies on natural resources.
3873 2018-12-19 17:59:23 Not at all but I can never chew or put it in my mouth even bacon or mushrooms fried in the same oil. I once cracked an egg with a chick inside, I never touched it ever again. I was like before 10 years old until now...

3877 2018-12-19 17:58:59 That’s why etfs beat 90% of active funds. What a snake oil salesman you are!
3878 2018-12-19 17:58:58 Some of the #NoDeal #Brexit plans published have reminded me of the apocalyptic novel Last Light where the PM has to implement plans to deal with the shutdown of global oil supplies... How very assuring
3879 2018-12-19 17:58:56 Did you notice the variance if there are negative economic impacts from the setback? The new rules officially puts oil and gas industry profits above the health of our children. Furthermore, it has no basis in science, completely arbitrary. #epicfail
3880 2018-12-19 17:58:53 Giant multinational oil companies aren’t globalists. They’re for the little people.
3881 2018-12-19 17:58:53 Of course #OIL going down on the news...But never went up on the force majeure
3882 2018-12-19 17:58:50 Baby Oil maybe?

3885 2018-12-19 17:58:34 so I made some Shea butter and coconut oil mix infused w THC and it’s probably the best topical ever
3886 2018-12-19 17:58:11 In your post a few days ago, you mentioned that pumping continues despite this trend. Is oil miscalculating or is it a calculated risk in light of a decade-long (at least) transition? 

Larger corps seem to be also jumping onto green deal as well. Cake and eat it, too?
3887 2018-12-19 17:57:55 Crude oil just made an intraday double top and is now dropping fast

3890 2018-12-19 17:57:23 Whatever happened to your campaign to take over oil fields to pay for the defense of these Countries? I'm not complaining. I was just wondering if it or something else can be done to bring down the cost?
3891 2018-12-19 17:57:13 bro we do not buy WTI , it is price of American oil, We buy Brent Crude Oil which is around 58 dollars, kindly search it,,

3893 2018-12-19 17:57:03 Scotty if I may I think he gets it but and have said it any times he is simply trying to institute his old man's dream of the HATED N.E.P. of the "80's re: no oil & gas
3894 2018-12-19 17:57:01 No, they are waking up to the right thing. Anne, this whole thing was a big giant racist/capitalist project to screw black people and protect profits of newspapers, oil companies, cotton companies, and paper companies. GTFO of here with your racist crap. We've had enough.
3895 2018-12-19 17:56:58 Just following the rest off aim shares south probably. Oil dropped not helped either,if aim turns after the year could be a decent run on this and many others. Problem is too many decent ones to pick from. Yet many buy high risk drillers or placing dumps mental imo. Pick wisely
3896 2018-12-19 17:56:53 As of Sept 30, 2015  ISIS caliphate was as large as it would ever be.

The Russian bombing campaign started at this date. The ensuing months saw ISIS caliphate crumble into full retreat mode.  Less than a year later most of the oil convoys were toast.

Coincidence?? Nah... 
3897 2018-12-19 17:56:45 Yes and No. No for oil but Yes to confront Iran.
3898 2018-12-19 17:56:40 Heath uses oil every night, swears by it.
3899 2018-12-19 17:56:40 Glad to hear Blippar has finally gone bust. They were a scammy bunch of snake oil salesmen in 2011 and a scammy bunch of snake oil salesmen in 2018 too. They will not be missed.
3900 2018-12-19 17:56:40 Bram! This fool said she prolly do oil changes on the said and i was DONEt
3901 2018-12-19 17:56:36 I already have all but 3 nodes at 100% complete. My point is that I'm tired of spending so much oil when I'm used to the revamp.
3902 2018-12-19 17:56:31 And the ill Informed freeloading idiots in the country will still love him.... Because he's promised everything for free, albeit at the expense of future generations.
3903 2018-12-19 17:56:21 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.

3914 2018-12-19 17:55:43 I’ve done that to myself with that stuff too. It’s got tea tree oil in it, I think, so with even mildly sensitive skin you’ve gotta watch how long it’s left on for.
3915 2018-12-19 17:55:42 So I applied some nag champa perfume oil in the office today and someone walked past me and complained of a bad smell. Fuck.
3916 2018-12-19 17:55:41 Maybe CBD oil? Has the calming effects without actually getting "high." Smoking something too strong or too much of it will make you trip.
3917 2018-12-19 17:55:38 I need a man who will take my car to get an oil change and clean it out for me, I don't think I'm asking for too much honestly.
3918 2018-12-19 17:55:35 Get tea tree oil!!
3919 2018-12-19 17:55:29 Trust is the oil of the future
3920 2018-12-19 17:55:10 Hi Robin. All suppliers that provide us with these ingredients are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive area throughout Asia, Africa, and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.
3921 2018-12-19 17:55:01 read the article. "While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas,"
3922 2018-12-19 17:54:56 You forgot to mention the billions and billions of subsidies to oil companies over the last few decades needs to be paid back first (yes, you can take the equalization payments off the bill--you still owe!)
3923 2018-12-19 17:54:55 In a free market, Irving Oil our east buys crude from the market, not a mandated supplier. You’re talking about a nationalized energy sector like Mexico. Otherwise, governments have little to nothing to do with these business decisions.
3924 2018-12-19 17:54:50 For those wondering why Gas is Cheap right now, the price of Oil on the Stock Market is below $50 a barrel right now.
3925 2018-12-19 17:54:27 Oil and Gas companies are only diversifying their assets.  They know fossil fuel is going out, and wind is coming in.

To bad Canada doesn't get it and start phasing out fossil fuels.  I guess saving humanity isn't important
3926 2018-12-19 17:54:22 Some people are buying cooking oil as show off. $10 2l cooking oil is like R60 in SA. They are also bread as show off. $1.50 is like R6 in SA.

It's not only uniforms, everything in Zim is miserable.
3927 2018-12-19 17:54:18 Yup - Shell invested in one of my thermal energy clients. Many oil & gas companies are now starting renewable arms - or separate renewable companies all together. It just makes sense. 

We just only hear Trump's strange coal statements and not much of the actual work being done.
3928 2018-12-19 17:54:15 Yes he wants to phase them out because oil is a dying industry that doesn’t mean he hates pipelines
3929 2018-12-19 17:54:14 Its all about evidence. Palm oil is a subject of scrutiny. If it really doesn't hurt the environment or human health, solid unbiased evidence should come into the light.
3930 2018-12-19 17:54:13 EL-A-YAH WHICH IS THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL OF OUR PEOPLE(OLIVE OIL)
EL AND YAH ARE 2 OF GOD'S SACRED NAMES/CHRIST-CHRISTOS IN THE GREEK MEANS THE ANOINTED ONE.
GOD HAS GIVEN US INSTRUCTIONS TO ANOINT OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES FOR HEALING AND PROTECTION.
GBY!
3931 2018-12-19 17:54:11 The lot of you have your head up your behinds. Funny that you hate the resource but don’t mind it absolutely funds your social programs. I don’t support oil or pipelines, but that isn’t cause to make stuff up, be dishonest or somehow look down on Albertans.
3932 2018-12-19 17:54:03 So crypto is basically the 21st century snake oil.
3933 2018-12-19 17:54:03 How sure are you that we are not using oil . A project that has a payback period of 40 yrs automatically targets oil. Just thinking 
3934 2018-12-19 17:54:00 I see youtube is going all out advertising to me that I should like big oil and wanting private infra funds. Thats some bad targeting.
3935 2018-12-19 17:53:56 They really did...mate. PRT has been negative for the last 3 years and there have been varipus packages given by the Treasury in order to maintain investment. 

The SNP SGC report has Oil revenue as essentially zero going forward.
3936 2018-12-19 17:53:46 (KJV) Exodus 30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 

GOD BLESS YOU IN JESUS NAME!
3937 2018-12-19 17:53:44 Oil price extending gains - more than 3.3% higher above $48 a barrel ahead of the crucial Fed rate announcement in just over an hour.
3938 2018-12-19 17:53:26 It wasn't Washington who was allowing ISIS oil manufacturing into Turkey, it was Turkey, the same people who will now swoop into Northern Syria because you want the only thing keeping them out and stopping ethnic cleansing to leave
3939 2018-12-19 17:53:15 WTI Crude should remain at US$ 50 per barrel; otherwise shale oil production of USA will start falling
3940 2018-12-19 17:53:12 Up your game, cook your grilled cheese on a thin layer of peanut oil, fry the bread a bit while melting the cheese. 
Not too much oil though, it can get soggy, which is not the goal!
3941 2018-12-19 17:53:01 Not selling them just paying homage to the Master from Oil Trough, Tx
3942 2018-12-19 17:53:01 Argon oil
3943 2018-12-19 17:52:57 Your nigga can’t change your oil BUT I ain’t shit. #Freewill
3944 2018-12-19 17:52:55 Your "foundation" has been a personal checkbook. How does it feel to FINALLY be held accountable for your criminal activities? You're nothing but a cheap, two-bit snake oil salesman.
3945 2018-12-19 17:52:54 Don't forget! We still are giving service discounts with a Toy Donation to Toy's for Tots! Regular oil change 14.95 with donation. Synthetic and diesels are more. See service for details! #Toys
3946 2018-12-19 17:52:46 Restore our parks and save our national treasures. Don't let this #LunaticInChief sell off any land for oil drilling or fracking.
3947 2018-12-19 17:52:41 (KJV) Mark 6:13 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.

GOD BLESS YOU IN JESUS NAME!
3948 2018-12-19 17:52:40 Sounds like that snake oil salesmen, Obama
3949 2018-12-19 17:52:39 Please don't "Rob" our parks by opening them up to your oil and gas buddies.
3950 2018-12-19 17:52:36 Either way. Papa always said ‘the market giveth and the market taketh away’ and I’m happy to see their ship run aground in the form of falling oil prices and a weakening strangle hold on output
3951 2018-12-19 17:52:25 Desalinization equipment will be like oil drilling equipment today. So, no problem. Several small countries today do not have enough fresh drinking water but because of desalinization plants they are able to thrive.
3952 2018-12-19 17:52:21 So BC is bad so a pipeline wouldn't hurt? It would be catastrophic for a dilbit spill in coastal BC waters. Dilbit floats for a short time, then sinks.

I read about the AB oil&gas companies making huge quarterly earnings. Why aren't they building a refinery & helping workers?
3953 2018-12-19 17:52:20 got my co workers asking me all types of questions man  like bro leave me be before i fuck around and put ya head in hot ass oil and let that bitch sizzle till your brain starts boiling like hot dogs . SCRAM 
3954 2018-12-19 17:52:14 Don't buy Oreo they use Palm oil
3955 2018-12-19 17:52:12 @RahulGandhi crud oil price has-been fallen into  45 USD from 73 USD in International market !  But only 9 rupees reduced instead Rs 25 .Corperates looting to innocent people on the cooperation of Modi government . It deserving a strong national agitation against this looting !
3956 2018-12-19 17:52:10  Have you ever made cake mix cookies? They’re quick and easy. 1 box of cake mix (whatever flavor you like), 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of oil, your favorite mix-ins or sprinkles. Mix all together, roll into little balls, put on cookie sheet, bake at 350 for 7-10 min. Makes 24 cookies.
3957 2018-12-19 17:52:09 Mine: wheat and groundnut oil
3958 2018-12-19 17:52:08 Thieves oil. Apply it every day. Swear by it
3959 2018-12-19 17:52:07 my mom just came to work, dropped off her credit card and told me to go get my oil changed and my breaks fixed. thankkk youuuu mommy

3961 2018-12-19 17:51:43 Yeah I remember Bolton going to Armenia saying they should cut all oil and gas imports with Iran and now Armenia is calling for both the expansion of Gas pipeline and more to be built. Also Azerbaijan is expanding its economic and energy ties.
3962 2018-12-19 17:51:37 (KJV) Psalms 23:5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

READ THIS 2 OR 3 TIMES!
GOD BLESS YOU IN JESUS NAME!
3963 2018-12-19 17:51:36 I just made an appointment to have the oil changed and tires rotated on my car for the 29th. I wanted it done before the new year because I already have several meetings scheduled in January and I’m working on adding some play time and balance in the new year.
3964 2018-12-19 17:51:35 Libs: “Can’t take oil money? How ‘bout a cop? That’s cool with the coveted black woman vote, right?”

3967 2018-12-19 17:51:29 Question: is it a film version of the leftist fever dream about starting a war over oil and Halliburton and Black Water and [gutteral scream]BUSH IS A WAR CRIMINAL? Or is it fairly bipartisan
3968 2018-12-19 17:51:14 Of course the hot oil splashes onto my face
3969 2018-12-19 17:51:08 X cukup power tu kot. Sy tenyeh ngan olive oil 
3970 2018-12-19 17:51:04 As well as the subsidies that the oil industry received over the years. And the health transfers. And their share of the federal debt.
3971 2018-12-19 17:51:03 $1.6B is 20 days of lost oil revenues due to the price differential.  That's it.
3972 2018-12-19 17:51:03 Much of the North America imports are Saudi oil sourced through US distributors. Still Saudi oil.
3973 2018-12-19 17:51:02 They are selling us snake oil, with the best salesman on the market. Trying to tell us they will be "fearless" but too afraid to commit to generational talents that won't be Cano's age for a decade. It's the same mets, same wilpons, different person (@GMBVW ) pushing BS.
3974 2018-12-19 17:51:01 Rough? Yes. They need help? I agree. But oil won’t save them and it is time to phase it out. Just wish Alberta will be smart enough to balance its economy. Tar sands aren’t the future.
3975 2018-12-19 17:51:00 Huge respect to @elonmusk on the words to #SEC
@business don't downgrade one of the biggest genious of this century. Give respect to whom more than deserve it.
Also believe prices are high due to pressure of Oil industry
3976 2018-12-19 17:50:54 if Alberta can’t get their oil to tide water in Canada, what makes people think they could more easily as independent country?The routes are exactly the same. If anything, RoC is likely to be even less open to having pipelines with fewer benefits.
3977 2018-12-19 17:50:43 You missed the word “yet.” But then, I have no doubt that had he let it die, you’d be shouting, “Trudeau doesn’t support our oil!” No winning with CPC supporters.
3978 2018-12-19 17:50:42 We want jobs. The old adage give a man a fish. People are upset that Alberta has paid billions upon billions in equalization to have those provinces block jobs and import oil. Makes no sense.
3979 2018-12-19 17:50:37 Hahaha! I have to reorder oil from amazon 

Also I couldn’t find the walking dead death scene you talked about so I failed 
3980 2018-12-19 17:50:34 And the world would be mighty foolish to think Putin is going to put a stop to a larger regional war that would imperil Middle East oil shipments to the world. Russia would see the greatest benefit from that. In fact, it's probably what they want!
3981 2018-12-19 17:50:32 There is no "both sides". There's the one side that has scientific data, and the other side that has conspiracy theories perpetrated by the oil industry.

Sometimes a person really is just plain wrong.
3982 2018-12-19 17:50:29  Take a small bowl pour some Olive oil in it, hold it high and ask Father to bless it for Healing and Protection in Jesus name. Take your finger and anoint yourself in Jesus Yeshua's precious name.  Anoint your house, car etc.. anything you want protected.
GBY IN JESUS NAME!
3983 2018-12-19 17:50:28 I should have let the chopped onions marinate a little longer in the olive oil and butter but I got too impatient. Lol
3984 2018-12-19 17:50:24 OK- but does the WWF have that much power in Canada or where ever? I've heard of the WWF but I didn't think they influenced the oil industry.
3985 2018-12-19 17:50:21 Here’s your trophy  , wow
3986 2018-12-19 17:50:21 The *once oil rich land*, there fixed it for you...
3987 2018-12-19 17:50:16 So what? Pull our troops out and let the cats s%$t in the sandbox. We don't need their oil or drugs. Better yet send Marco.
3988 2018-12-19 17:50:00  THE OLIVE OIL IS NOT THE HEALING POWER-GOD IS.
ANOINTING WITH OLIVE OIL IS THE OBEDIENCE TO FOLLOWING GOD'S INSTRUCTIONS.
WHEN YOU FOLLOW GOD'S INSTRUCTIONS-HE IS PLEASED WITH YOU!
GOD BLESS YOU IN JESUS NAME!
3989 2018-12-19 17:49:55 Like Saudi without the oil.
3990 2018-12-19 17:49:48 And what, return to the petro-dollar? And the bases, soldiers, federal employees and buildings, FN ppl, lands, treaties, etc. Do they not see the dumpster fire of England’s brexit negotiations? And over Oil. Not even culture. Unless it’s the flourishing culture of greed..
3991 2018-12-19 17:49:44 I grilled me a nice chicken breast last night seasoned to perfection and cut up some cucumbers with olive oil, Bragg’s, and cayenne pepper  with three spoonfuls of rice. Lunch is exciting on a daily for me fr y’all I be so happy 
3992 2018-12-19 17:49:40 I’m waiting on an oil change and this nice elderly woman asked me to help her open her Gatorade bottle then gave me the best hug 
3993 2018-12-19 17:49:40 Jesus...just stop. You still have to get your oil thru Canada/US with new approvals of pipelines etc...land locked and forced to set up new borders rules/regs and taxes to deal with Canada on 3 sides and the US south. New Gov policies, healthcare etc etc....
3994 2018-12-19 17:49:37 Ya I love alikay naturals!! Their shampoo really makes my scalp feel clean and I love the fact that you can see the oil separating when it sits
3995 2018-12-19 17:49:27 The good news is that a better grade of gasoline, two quarts of oil and topped up power steering fluid seems to have helped the check engine light issue for now
3996 2018-12-19 17:49:26 if I go one more day without an oil change I'm gonna spray my load all over the fucking parking lot
3997 2018-12-19 17:49:24 Drizzle thine ass in olive oil and garlic sauce and maybe we will have a deal
3998 2018-12-19 17:49:24 Metal as a sector looks weak as global demand is expected to go down. Sino-US dilemma on #tradewar is still not over. Metal stocks have already risen in past & are expected to shed few %ages from CMP.
In #India , #inflation & #Crude prices are the key.
#GSAT7A #news #Oil #stocks
3999 2018-12-19 17:49:19 Girl it’s literally like a sugar cookie vs snickerdoodle thing. The only difference is instead of cream of tartar, I added a teaspoon of Greek yogurt and cinnamon sugar to the batter and i coated the pan with coconut oil so it made it a little lighter and airy!
4000 2018-12-19 17:49:14 #PalmOil is a versatile and popular ingredient, used in everything from shampoo to chocolate to toothpaste. If it’s grown sustainably, palm oil production can benefit local communities, and help to protect valuable species and forests. Let's push for GOOD palm oil!
4001 2018-12-19 17:49:08 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
4002 2018-12-19 17:48:43 Never fails finally caught up on bills then my stupid car needs gas, breaks and an oil change like the greedy whore that she is 
4003 2018-12-19 17:48:43 The way I ex the kitchen whenever my mum is about to take the cover off the pot with palm oil. I'm not ready to die from asphyxiation thanks
4004 2018-12-19 17:48:36 Since almost all the "French" in #Louisiana were Acadians from New Brunswick / Nova Scotia, it makes just as much sense to give it back to Canada. As a Canadian province, it could smoke weed, pump oil & support local music all it wanted, would have better education & healthcare.
4005 2018-12-19 17:48:23 The Russians were right to call out Washington... when Putin showed the footage of miles-long oil truck convoys going from Raqqa across the border into Turkey, he asked them "do you guys really not see this"... Obama was allowing it.

Everything totally changed in October 2015.
4006 2018-12-19 17:48:23 International recognition of “national waters” would assign the vast majority of oil fields to Scottish Waters. As for the 1m who voted Leave, they have as much say as the 48% who voted Yes. I think the response is, “You lost. Get over it” 2/
4007 2018-12-19 17:48:21 2. Also that alleged welfare state you're moaning about, well it has been managing its finances, under Liberal rule, quite well over the last 6 - 8 years and is in surplus currently.

And I remind you again, AB was in deficit under Conservative rule, with $100/barrel oil.
4008 2018-12-19 17:48:17 Wish my dad was good for something and taught me how to change my own oil 
4009 2018-12-19 17:48:14 That u a call the oil rich land? That being said, I am grateful u drawing distinction and ready to put your money where your mouth is
4010 2018-12-19 17:48:11 In essence yes.  If all has been & will forever be copacetic for USD rsv status as structured, why wld we ever consider exporting oil for USD's that USD rsv apologists say we can issue ad infinitum, instead of printing USDs for oil like we always had done...unless something chgd?
4011 2018-12-19 17:47:53 Fish oil, eh? 
4012 2018-12-19 17:47:51 Question, is there a tail risk here, the Saudi peg goes will oil imploding, and that sets off a chain with China and causes the next serious leg down?
4013 2018-12-19 17:47:50 Oil companies have their interests and they see the writings on the wall
4014 2018-12-19 17:47:46 Infact that also would not be fair as previous four years faced heavy pressure due to crude oil reaching all time high, while the existing govt wasted the huge advantage in poor implementation of DeMo and GST
4015 2018-12-19 17:47:39 Don't see much Unusual today in Oil&Gas maybe $PTEN @HalftimeReport @petenajarian @jonnajarian
4016 2018-12-19 17:47:26 Smuggling of liquefied gas (#Belarusian oil company)  from Belarus to a number of EU countries is increasing .
WHO WILL STOP
4017 2018-12-19 17:47:07 'Beans and beans' of barrels of oil, and dollars to line pockets of the 1%.
4018 2018-12-19 17:47:01 잠이..안와.,
4019 2018-12-19 17:46:33 1. You are right.

There is no reason for it except successive provincial governments refusing to do the necessary but unpopular thing: Bring back a provincial sales tax.

AB was running deficits, under Conservative rule, with $100/barrel oil.

If AB couldn't make it work then...
4020 2018-12-19 17:46:31 It is way more environmentally friendly to flow Alberta Oil East that it is to bring it in from Saudi Arabia for a high number or Reasons but Climate Barbie and Potato Head Trudeau can’t seem to figure that out !!
4021 2018-12-19 17:46:22 So this guy's answer to the brutally incompetent legacy of PC party history is to nationalize the oil industry? Have we learned nothing from the @RachelNotley era? Or Venezuela?
4022 2018-12-19 17:46:21 I'm long the dollar going into this meeting. Oil is cheap
4023 2018-12-19 17:46:18 there’s this oil i found at marshalls, its by pearl essence and it’s argan & vitamin E oil in a pink little dropper bottle, it’s AMAZING!!! i really like it. you should try some! it’s only like $6
4024 2018-12-19 17:46:14 Did you notice the variance if there are negative economic impacts from the setback? The new rules officially puts oil and gas industry profits above the health of our children. Furthermore, it has no basis in science, completely arbitrary. #epicfail
4025 2018-12-19 17:46:11 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet lower wages.
4026 2018-12-19 17:46:03 You're going to hear a lot about Trump's twisted love affair with coal, oil and dirty energy methods.

But don't get it twisted. The US clean energy sector is booming with innovation and solutions. 

(..Even by oil companies).
4027 2018-12-19 17:46:03 yes i use the oil reducing one and i have rly sensitive skin it’s fine for me at least
4028 2018-12-19 17:45:56 Hope oil
4029 2018-12-19 17:45:51 It gets murky too because many oil companies, like Chevron, are investing a lot in green energy. So I think looking at policy stances may be a better indicator than say... family trust stock investments (chevron was the highest one I believe).

But overall, transparency.
4030 2018-12-19 17:45:45 Did you notice the variance if there are negative economic impacts from the setback? The new rules officially puts oil and gas industry profits above the health of our children. Furthermore, it has no basis in science, completely arbitrary. #epicfail
4031 2018-12-19 17:45:40 Gupti aunty aap ka bacha bahar aah Gaya maro math aunty aap koun sa oil use krte ho
4032 2018-12-19 17:45:40 Trump’s snake oil, together with the prospect of collecting more riches than he’d ever imagined possible, was just more than he could resist.
4033 2018-12-19 17:45:37 The BMC  vegetable market 'Reserved Plot', has been illegally leased out to a car dealer. It's in the lane next to Indian oil petrol pump that leads to link road.
4034 2018-12-19 17:45:35 Alberta was a “have” province for ages. Oil allowed them the eliminate provincial sales tax. Newfoundland was a “have not” province. Tens of thousands lost their way of life. So now Alberta is falling to “have not” while Newfoundland is “have”. Things change. Adapt. Survive.
4035 2018-12-19 17:45:16 “That makes me the new leader!”

“You said that when Megu-Chon switched her long-distance carrier.”

“Yes, but—“

“And during her last oil change. And any time she uses ‘the’ in a sentence.”

“I’M STILL CALLING DIBS!”
4036 2018-12-19 17:45:07 Bulls currently holding a 3:1 edge over decliners - very strong readign there. $VIX down 7.5%. Ticks have been largely positive today and oil bouncing. All good signs, but the proof will be in the pudding when the FOMC statement comes out at 2pm.

4041 2018-12-19 17:44:49 Yes, there's big potential in Indian market. We know how much this oil rise pinch us everytime, if you want I can take care of your plans to expand.
4042 2018-12-19 17:44:47 Good points. I hope the majority of Albertans do wake up and see through the lies posted to them by the oil and gas industry and their puppets in the official opposition.

4044 2018-12-19 17:44:44 The last thing a customer expects is to take a car for service @BaronsBMWUK @BMWGroup and 2 weeks later have the oil dash light flashing and car not starting very well.
4045 2018-12-19 17:44:39 Good luck lol. No one could replace the jobs created by oil, gas, and coal in the next 16 years.

4047 2018-12-19 17:44:26 You’re an idiot. Russia will collapse. They are in a recession and oil is below $50.  Let them spend money in Syria they don’t have. Russia can’t go to international markets for bonds. Nobody trusts Russia.

Bad news for those working in the oil industry.

4061 2018-12-19 17:43:04 Let me do this hot oil treatment
4062 2018-12-19 17:42:51 Right, but they're "comfortable" now? I think they'd be more comfortable with oil >70 
4063 2018-12-19 17:42:42 “Whip cream and oil, spank you cause you spoil” 
4064 2018-12-19 17:42:36 ... and also a safe investment, since you will live to boost the profit. Renewable energy will be in great demand, forever. Gas, oil and coal will not.
4065 2018-12-19 17:42:34 As the poor saw the remaining middle class get these privileges with the so called Democrats, they decided it was time for the poor to start getting a piece of the pie

Hence, in comes Chavez, with the promise there was oil $$$ to share for everyone

The rest is history
4066 2018-12-19 17:42:32 OK, I can dig that too.  But then the argument is not about oil, but funding?
4067 2018-12-19 17:42:31 *Adds Olive Oil and a pinch of salt to balance the bitterness of your tweets*
4068 2018-12-19 17:42:31 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.
4069 2018-12-19 17:42:17 Buying gold is stupid.  Wait until countries start selling their gold. Prices will drop. Russia is in a recession and oil prices are below $50. Russia will collapse.
4070 2018-12-19 17:42:16 Oil revenue doesn't underpin the UK economy as the last 5 uears the UK taxpayer has bailed the north sea out.

4072 2018-12-19 17:41:54 What I want to try is bulletproof coffee. Coffee, butter, and MCT oil.
4073 2018-12-19 17:41:50 I know that certain muds have healing properties. I'd also suggest Aloe Vera and Tea Tree Oil gel for cooling off and healing both the skin and scars.
4074 2018-12-19 17:41:49 If men do agree that it's a different and fantastic feeling when a girl rides in circular motion, why don't they implement the same when they are on top? It works both ways. Can't just dip like you checking for oil all the time. Move those hips too. #TrustAfterDark.

4077 2018-12-19 17:41:22 okie so i just mixed like one and half tablespoon of aloevera gel with 25 drops of tea tree oil and 5 drops of rosemary oil and half a teaspoon almond oil, thats it!
4078 2018-12-19 17:41:20 The only reason the original USA highway system was put in was because Eisenhower saw the German roads in WW2, said we need this for defense, and wrote it up as a defense expense. (After non-competitive oil ripped out the rail infrastructure.)
4079 2018-12-19 17:41:17 Brilliant speech! If those who invest in the gas, oil and coal industries would understand the message, they’d shift focus towards renewable energy NOW instead of waiting for the inevitable decline in profit...

4081 2018-12-19 17:41:08 I found that sketchers with the memory form helped me a lot, but from what you described maybe not for you.  I also enjoy cbd oil, which i should go find mine lol to try and help me sleep better
4082 2018-12-19 17:41:08 Got my tires patched for free cuz the shop gave me a high quality oil change when I asked for a cheap one lol 90$ job turned into 60$
4083 2018-12-19 17:40:59 ごめん論外
4084 2018-12-19 17:40:54 Of course it can many examples of 4 Million population nations globally. Our incredible oil/gas reserves and strategic trading relationships with US would position Alberta as an extremely wealthy and successful independent country.
4085 2018-12-19 17:40:53 What I found interesting was how the need for Oil would rise.  If Alberta isn’t filling that gap someone else will.
4086 2018-12-19 17:40:47 I was thinking of a warm bubble bath with a glass of Cabernet, oil sounds more practical though.
4087 2018-12-19 17:40:38 Adulting! Teach them how to budget and grocery shop and change a tire and check oil and all the things I WASNT prepared for growing up.

4097 2018-12-19 17:40:06 I get what your saying but the undeveloped countries will still be in oil while we are onto the next energy cause it’s realively cheap compared to what it produces. Canada still ships asbestos daily and it’s been bane for use since 1976. Oil will live well past our lives.
4098 2018-12-19 17:40:05 ไม่ได้หรอก
4099 2018-12-19 17:40:05 Tip: When you're next at the supermarket get some #coconut flour, coconut oil and Almond flour - these are great to have in your cupboard to make #Keto friendly breads and cakes!
4100 2018-12-19 17:40:03 Trump and the oil ministers of USA are still alive.
4101 2018-12-19 17:39:58 ไปด้วยกันดิ
4102 2018-12-19 17:39:34 It’s like Olive oil and Cooking oil! Which one is better?
4103 2018-12-19 17:39:30 Never buy products containing palm oil, even if it's "the good kind".
Put it back on the shelf, walk away.
4104 2018-12-19 17:39:26 Yes but that is not what alberta wanted. So the money is pointless, they will still push for the pipeline to be built or oil to be transported via trains.
4105 2018-12-19 17:39:22 I swea me and my ex like oil and water  we don’t mix well together but sometimes we can do-exist
4106 2018-12-19 17:39:18 got a lovely housewarming present from my mum today. bread, wine, salt, olive oil and honey. she said they were traditional gifts so I did a bit of research...
4107 2018-12-19 17:39:14 Unite?  Why so they can collapse again?  Russia is in a recession, oil is below $50 so Russia will collapse again. Let the Russians spend money they don’t have in Syria.  I can’t wait to watch Russia collapse again.
4108 2018-12-19 17:39:12 coconut oil, hair elastics, mouthwash and toothbrush/toothpaste, clean a tee and shorts to go home in!
4109 2018-12-19 17:38:48 Sure they do. But we’re a country - one day when oil is depleted and Alberta is hurting I’m sure the concept of ‘Canada’ will be more appealing.
4110 2018-12-19 17:38:41 Oil and Gas.
4111 2018-12-19 17:38:36 I’m so tired!! I had to pick up my husband in the midst of his car getting repaired this morning, take a placement test, now I’m home to relax a little before my next test and I have to be to the next town over at 4. I also need an oil change. AHHHHHHHH
4112 2018-12-19 17:38:34 Maybe we should buy our own oil, after all?
4113 2018-12-19 17:38:34 lol you started by saying "big labor" and implying that gay rights people are the same as oil lobbyists
pointing out the flaw in that argument isn't the same as supporting all lobbyists

Cut spending
Israel doesn't need it's subsidy
Big oil doesn't
Big agriculture
Factory Farming
Cut military spending by 60
Stop giving trillions of money to the Pentagon
There's tons of wasteful spending to cut back on
4121 2018-12-19 17:37:32 Easy green  for #frugal people - Coconut  oil can eliminate the need for baby oil, shave gel, body lotion. It kills bacteria, viruses & fungus. In the kitchen, use it instead of butter & shortening.Reduce #plasticwaste, #toxicchemicals. Be healthier and more #sustainable.

4130 2018-12-19 17:36:46 I have one of my idiot friend eats a ton of rice with some chicken curry fried or cooked on seed oil..leaving his LDL his VLDL is 57 . Should I blame that chicken? First time I saw something this high VLDL.
4131 2018-12-19 17:36:43 He never had a wall to kiss in the first place. It was his best dog and pony show.  He gave his base the lowest common denominator to fall for and they bought it. Trump is the snake oil salesman.
4132 2018-12-19 17:36:42 How is weed oil supposed to help a dog that can’t see, hear, or walk properly??
4133 2018-12-19 17:36:38 Premium synthetic would make sense because it is a light oil and shell uses it at their local refinery but rightly so heavy syn blend is less than wti. Either way upgrading oil reduces its volume only slightly and wouldn’t fix the bottleneck for exports.
4134 2018-12-19 17:36:36 Don't confuse oil shale with nat gas shale. Sure there's overlap, but fracking was initially a nat gas concept developed when $10 gas was forecast to be a new median price level.
4135 2018-12-19 17:36:34 I thought Beto was #1, since tons of people in Texas work at oil and gas companies
4136 2018-12-19 17:36:34 It’s always fun to bring your car to the dealership to get an oil change and walk out knowing you need almost $1000 bucks in repairs

4141 2018-12-19 17:36:04 I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to be in a bad mood about though :( That's awful. I've heard peppermint oil helps with migraines, maybe that will help? Take it easy, rest well friend <3
4142 2018-12-19 17:36:04 Technically could increase oil production but that would be self defeating as price of oil would likely fall. Fiscal policy is unlikely. Therefore, either revisit budget or as you suggest privatise...

4148 2018-12-19 17:35:14 The funniest thing about #Brexit has been watching centrists collectively lose their shit without any voice of power in parliament. UK Centrist project was brought to the cliff by big oil then shoved off when #brexit vote was called.

4151 2018-12-19 17:35:09 Just curious , when that refinery in east coast had layoffs due to their excuse of RIN prices there was a big uproar, how come no one cares now about #ethanol layoffs ?

4167 2018-12-19 17:32:43 There are many Albertans who have educated themselves about both the oil industry and the equalization system who aren't pissed and who think this faux outrage is ridiculous.

4173 2018-12-19 17:32:10 You have done no such thing. You have Iranians to thank for the feat. All you have done is stop the US/ Israeli cash & weapons flow to #ISIS for oil and gas thefts from Iraq and Syria which, was the Obama/Saudi/Qatari/UAE/Turkey operation in the first place.
4174 2018-12-19 17:32:06 Oh really?
What they did in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan...they invade them just for oil they killed millions of people for no reason just for false claims after slowly said sorry...? Who support US governments their public...what was that state sponsored terrorism...note it dear
4175 2018-12-19 17:32:05 Since she feels this way the only fair thing to do would be to stop shipping fuel, natural gas, and oil products to Victory and help these nut cases get off oil and eliminate their carbon footprint
4176 2018-12-19 17:32:04 So basically, Trump the neoliberal realizes that with Turkey having assumed the role of giving direct military support to the jihadist crypto-al Qaeda non-moderate rebels, the US gov can realize it’s true goal across the mid-east: “genocidal theocratic fascism makes the oil flow”

4179 2018-12-19 17:31:41 Every. Single. Time. I get my car worked on there’s an old guy in the waiting area prepared to explain to me how something works. Today, it’s my oil change. #mansplaining101
4180 2018-12-19 17:31:36 The price of oil was not a consideration in my yes vote Scotland has so much more than oil to make it thrive we are the only nation in the UK with a trade surplus and already pay far more to Westminster than we get back .

4182 2018-12-19 17:31:26 SAUDI FINANCE MINISTER SAYS "COMFORTABLE" WITH OIL PRICES UP TO NOW AND "RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE" EVEN IN WORST CASE SCENARIO: RTRS. #OOTT
4183 2018-12-19 17:31:21 Dropped my car off at 7:45 for oil change. It’s 12:30 and they’re not done yet. Tf kinda establishment is this?
4184 2018-12-19 17:31:20 5 under 88 working repeatedly near Oil & Energy.
4185 2018-12-19 17:31:19 Mereka awalnya jualan ganja sintetis (gorila, ganesha, k2, spice, dsb dsb) di Line & IG. Operasinya dari dalam Lapas, pabriknya di Klp.Gading. Berkali² mrk kena, tp selalu bisa 86 krn mrk dibackup duit mafia sabu. Sekarang mrk jualan ekstrak gorilla tapi pakai nama CBD Oil.
4186 2018-12-19 17:30:53 If your elected what plan do you have to help Nfld concerning muskrat falls project. Here is a renewable long term low co2 emission project but Nfld is in a financial crisis. Do we help out big oil or do we help out less co2 environmental impact means of producing energy.
4187 2018-12-19 17:30:51 Maybe the oil will pay for these projects retrospectively.
4188 2018-12-19 17:30:51 Oil #futures recoup some overnight losses triggered by demand concerns: #WTI at $47.66/bbl (+3.07%), #Brent at $57.60/bbl (+2.38%) #OOTT #oilandgas
4189 2018-12-19 17:30:47 What the US is pulling out of a proxy war with Russia? And using ISIS as a reason is a lie! SMH We rather spend money destroying other nations using good people while protecting our interests (oil) when money could be spent here and not dependent on other nations resources.
4190 2018-12-19 17:30:44 I want tea tree oil
4191 2018-12-19 17:30:44 This oil change needs to hurry the hell up 
4192 2018-12-19 17:30:41 Yep. And we do that we led lights made of oil and solarpanels that are destryoing the enviroment with the production. Maybe if we stop our complete technological revolution we might have a shot. Annything else is hypocrit and the only reason someone cares(like total) is money
4193 2018-12-19 17:30:40 To wrap up: @DruhFarrell (and others), I urge you not to get swept up in the 'our oil is best' rhetoric without looking at the reasoning behind our import and export trends. The overly simplified version of pipelines being the only answer *from a consumptive side* is malarkey.
4194 2018-12-19 17:30:38 ah you’re one of those NPC brain geniuses. You know absolutely nothing about this conflict apparently, much less Erdogan’s motivations. Taking out a secular, nationalist (the idea that they’d be happy in a federal Syria is a joke), oil owning Kurdish state is a major motivation
4195 2018-12-19 17:30:28 well this is a total awesome option… I remember not that long ago a kid in school  wanted to make his family oil medicines ...I remember his new garden kept him out of trouble .., its going to be an exciting journey . I agree , #PaveTheWay ;o) #BlessedAndHighlyFavored

4197 2018-12-19 17:30:24 So now that the price of a barrel of oil is going down does that mean the price of gas is going down especially in California? I hope so @cnni @WSJ
4198 2018-12-19 17:30:19 i've never cared

4205 2018-12-19 17:29:18 FFS. Kenney has spent the past month going on and on about how Quebec should stop using “foreign dictator oil” when the reality is that the vast majority of it comes from Alberta or the US. Unless you’re going to label the US as a dictatorship, it’s BS. Catch up.
4206 2018-12-19 17:29:17 Yes we are Herb but for oil the big picture matters more. Canada has the least environmental impact on it's oil extraction and refinement. If we don't do it another country will and with more environmental impact. So yes it's bad but the lesser evil of the choices.
4207 2018-12-19 17:29:12 Yet the tight oil DUC's just keep rising.  These are an indirect hedge. Won't be produced until prices increase and continues to lower the ceiling on WTI prices.  Rising level of capital not returned to shareholders sunk into DUCs

4211 2018-12-19 17:28:59 Especially the shale sector which is the biggest bearer of junk debt and most smaller players have break evens at higher than current price of oil... talk about getting in a pincer grip...
4212 2018-12-19 17:28:54 Better question: how is Norway paying for hydroelectric plants and subsidies for electric cars? 
By being one of the largest oil exporters.
4213 2018-12-19 17:28:51 Yeah, and in the case of Standard Oil consumers ended up paying MORE for oil products because Standard had become incredibly efficient at keeping costs low to keep out competition.  They were punished for running their business well!
4214 2018-12-19 17:28:47 @SuperbikeFactor recieved my bike only got 3 months mot on it and no oil in the engine at all seems odd as when I bought the bike I was told it came with a year's mot and serviced??? Please feel free to enlighten me as I'm really not impressed told one thing and sold another
4215 2018-12-19 17:28:46 Just as Alberta has become a 'company' province, so too is Canada becoming a 'company' country, both in the thrall of oil & gas companies.
4216 2018-12-19 17:28:31 glad so many people have offered to help you & Reggie! Add us to the list! Should you need CBD treats, powder supplement for pups, or oil - just drop me a line. nick@aliascann.com    I'd be happy to help 
4217 2018-12-19 17:28:30 Dig out! ...as our Royal Navy saying goes. Ask our PM for another Scottish referendum. What are you waiting for.....the oil price to go up?  Seriously, just call another ref Nicola!  Be brave for once.
4218 2018-12-19 17:28:20 My step mom keeps trying to sell me CBD oil but I got a skronger pack then that
4219 2018-12-19 17:28:18 Is there any decreases in oil prices?

4221 2018-12-19 17:28:06 Compañero,tu propuesta me parece fantástica, pero no funciona con el capitalismo. Hay q hacer cumplir las leyes antimonopolicas constitucionales con un nuevo Poder Judicial. Los medios son empresas capitalistas como la Standard Oil o Microsoft. La ley de Medios es Constitucional
4222 2018-12-19 17:27:59 Everyone spits out the Russian crap but we're the #1 energy exporter n Russia's economy is ran on oil. The fact that the whole Russia conspiracy still holds water with a portion of people really shows how stupid Americans are. People should worry more about China.
4223 2018-12-19 17:27:57 I'm from the East not West coast
4224 2018-12-19 17:27:50 Look into Fort Mac/fires. Muslims have built a huge mosque complex there. More than what meets the eye. Do you think it coincidence that they have moved into the rich oil fields of Alberta?  And the Saudi’s money is backing this?  TRUDEAU has some man oops boysplaining to do.
4225 2018-12-19 17:27:47 They would have to recall all the DVDs to put in random oil spills and Tonys arm everywhere
4226 2018-12-19 17:27:37 100$ for an oil change I’m sick
4227 2018-12-19 17:27:01 And what oil price did they use for GPT?
4228 2018-12-19 17:26:58 you would know about that
4229 2018-12-19 17:26:54 Exacto!
4230 2018-12-19 17:26:46 The proverbial dog, who already being penciled down for roasting simply decided to wanna go have a good bath in a bowl of palm oil. Don’t @ me it’s a bad choice. I go too drag you and your idols. Oshiradarada.
4231 2018-12-19 17:26:46 But we need hedge fund managers, property developers, unspecified INCREDIBLY WEALTHY "wheeler dealers" <AHEM>, footballers, Saudi princes, oil magnates...  !!!
4232 2018-12-19 17:26:44 Its all about the greed for oil, minerals (litium esp),  opium and looking like the saviors of the world. Until that stops?  Its all just smoke and mirrors
4233 2018-12-19 17:26:41 You have a plan to kill Canada's oil and gas industry with absolutely no true scientific or practical support for it.  You cloak it in "doing better for Canadians" when all it amounts to is you, Butts, and the rest of the Soros/Tides clan fulfilling your misguided wish.
4234 2018-12-19 17:26:33 Well if you’ve ever wondered what 450 degree oil felt like on your face...near your eye...I can now tell you from personal experience that it’s not good.

4241 2018-12-19 17:25:45 Who will remind to you that cried oil was sold between $28-$29/b in 2015 and the production was drastically reduced by the destructive activities of the Niger Delta Avengers, you're from the that region you should know.
4242 2018-12-19 17:25:41 Based on the wealth transfer its Quebec, again, that prospers from oil and gas. So I guess they’re responsible for the up and downstream pollution of fresh water aquifers. O&G has made huge strides in using recycled and produced water. Perfect? No. Better? Yes.

4247 2018-12-19 17:25:02 Oil and gas industry needs their suppliers in Quebec and Ontario to do the same.
4248 2018-12-19 17:24:55 You do not have the cleanest oil on the planet. You got that lie from someone in the industry.
4249 2018-12-19 17:24:54 How can one say this when Muslims are in our congress and buying up property on our land with money they receive from selling us oil? JS

4254 2018-12-19 17:24:08 Remember when Iceland paid LadBible to tell you their advert was 'banned' and you all cared about palm oil for two days
4255 2018-12-19 17:24:06 Long term oil is extremely speculative as so many manufacturers have vowed electric models within next 5 years.  Volvo, VW, etc..
4256 2018-12-19 17:24:05 Every other language with English is very much mixing equal parts of oil and water to produce an emulsion.

It's just... English is like a waterfall of problems for everyone else to learn second hand, and vice/versa.
4257 2018-12-19 17:24:04 there’s nothing a little 
@glossier + essential oil 
can’t fix
4258 2018-12-19 17:24:03 Footprint is MUCH smaller. Remember, drilling, shipping and refining oil uses LOTS of electric. Refining 1 gallon = same elec as an EV uses to go 25 miles. So right there an EV is already cleaner.
4259 2018-12-19 17:23:54 
You know how Norway finances their "green" initiatives, right? With massive OIL REVENUES.  It's like a contract killer donating to the local police to keep the area safer...
4260 2018-12-19 17:23:52 Imagine what will happen if Saudi cuts the oil off. Quebec’s gonna shit their pants
4261 2018-12-19 17:23:50 Rachel, I support everything you just tweeted. But forgive me if I’m a bit sceptical of a person who built a political career demonizing oil.  I hope your able to convince your NDP colleagues across Canada that our country is stronger/better with the strong energy sector.
4262 2018-12-19 17:23:50 and god so loved the world that she gave us jojoba oil
4263 2018-12-19 17:23:42 We can hope Assad will get Arab areas where the oil actually is.
4264 2018-12-19 17:23:39 That's what I'm saying! As crazy as the Natural Gas/Crude Oil ratio recently
4265 2018-12-19 17:23:28 It isn't time for that. KRG has to act like a grown up. If Turkey declares war, all Peshmerga need to be sent over. This will give more legitimacy and backing to Rojava. Let Turkey stop the oil. So what? Kurds need to unite. This is time. Not another Mahabad
4266 2018-12-19 17:23:25 Coconut oil

4268 2018-12-19 17:23:09 It's worth getting into that lucrative industry. Māori women are all over social media saying "our anti oil campaign plans was all over fb we weren't hiding anything you coulda just asked us" lol lol lol
4269 2018-12-19 17:23:04 “ISIL finances are drying up [...] Some revenue from oil fields in northeastern Syria continues to flow to the group.”

...ah. 

Big throbbing Dinosaur veins.
4270 2018-12-19 17:23:04 CBD oil, low to no carbs, no sugar and walking. As soon as I cheated and has sweet cakes and potatoes and rice. Pressure jacked right back up.
4271 2018-12-19 17:22:53 My cars begging for an oil change yet here I am blacking out on a Tuesday night

This Poll clearly shows you are all #OutofTouch with the Electorate of Quebec.
Under your Circumstances there is no #appetite in Alberta for hobbling our access to Tidewater, or the importing of Oil, or Quebec Dairy Products.
4273 2018-12-19 17:22:47 @phynofino “OIL” it’s more than a song man  am blessed thank you. 
4274 2018-12-19 17:22:40 Comey is nothing but a snake oil salesman peddling his narcissism wherever he goes
4275 2018-12-19 17:22:32 Sad u don't understand those r separate countries. As a little geography lesson, Norway has regions that have no oil production, but benefit greatly from those profits; AND won't have to bail out oil producing regions when the depleting  (assuming you knew that) resource ends.
4276 2018-12-19 17:22:26 my fav part of getting ready for a night out is when I oil up my legs & put on perfume
4277 2018-12-19 17:22:24 Tanginang kasoy oil to. Ang hapdi pala nakakaiyak! 
4278 2018-12-19 17:22:17 Funding electric is easy. Add a tax to big gas guzzling trucks being sold by the millions and use the funds to directly subsidize EV, charging and renewable energy! Politicians don't have guts or are in big oil's pockets. They play the public like a fiddle!
4279 2018-12-19 17:22:16 Have to admit it is entertaining to see a NDP government fight tooth and nail to support big oil.
4280 2018-12-19 17:22:15 I also found many testimonials of the skin being healed by using Evening Primrose Oil which is over the counter and very inexpensive. It can sometimes be found as the oil but usually it is in gelatin capsules and you just poke or cut a hole and use liberally!
4281 2018-12-19 17:22:14 Are you really burning oil
4282 2018-12-19 17:22:09 Oil you say? 
4283 2018-12-19 17:21:54 Coconut oil has a smoke point of 350F. Ghee has a smoke point of 485F!
4284 2018-12-19 17:21:53 America has fought all wars in the last 100 years knowing that when the war was over, we would walk away with the best of what the enemy had (Oil, natural resources, scientists, cheap labor) what does Syria have to offer, they don't even have dog shit ? No more wars for Israel !
4285 2018-12-19 17:21:53 And defeat oil bulls. You need oil to remain below 40$. Like you said lower oil is good for the world
4286 2018-12-19 17:21:53 oil y/y % against 10yr yield is same chart!
4287 2018-12-19 17:21:50 Not really. Have performed in Syria nothing at all. Conceited and by the area driven to avoid, everybody sees them only one mini-troop are. It not always functions like in Iraq. The only thing they have done, okkupy some Oil Fields....
4288 2018-12-19 17:21:46 My dad is really expecting me to check my own oil. I can barley put gas by myself..
4289 2018-12-19 17:21:41 Over at Sam Williams Career and College Academy, the teacher who was apprehended for dipping her students head in boiling oil is threatening the school once again. This time with mysterious objects from her trunk. Police have been notified and we will continue reporting. #JJNN
4290 2018-12-19 17:21:29 Jamaican castor oil
4291 2018-12-19 17:21:27 So if the majority of the equalization payments r coming from our oil. & we r struggling to even get the oil because of low oil prices & lack of pipelines, then shouldn’t the equalization payments go down?? Or just stop? The other provinces want our money but not pipelines??
4292 2018-12-19 17:21:23 Coconut oil is excellent. Related: the Body Shop's coconut body butter is lovely and inexpensive.

Ooh, I should add castor oil to my routine.
4293 2018-12-19 17:21:17 I’m not even a bit interested in oil and gasoline .The world  is switching to renewable energy. It’s time to phase out fossil fuels for good no matter what!
4294 2018-12-19 17:21:15 It’s Damn near 50 today in Chi-town!! Bust out the tanning oil and a lawn chair!!!!!!
4295 2018-12-19 17:21:10 War Oil- "Why don't damned oil companies fly their own flags on their property- maybe a flag with a gas pump on it" - Marine General Smedley Butler 1937
4296 2018-12-19 17:21:08 He sold all these people snake oil man!
4297 2018-12-19 17:21:03 Get him some CBD oil if you can.
4298 2018-12-19 17:20:59 I don't want them spent on wars big oil or the poor.. I couldn't give a shit less about other peoples suffering it is no skin of my ass.
4299 2018-12-19 17:20:54 How could it affect foreign investment any worse than whats happening now?Irving oil would be the only boardroom affected, the rest of the boardrooms would be cheering. It would spur foreign investment through the roof. The message would be we look after Canadian interests first.
4300 2018-12-19 17:20:52 because I didn’t take care of them, properly, because I had forgotten to pack my oil in, so my scalp wasn’t itchy, but now I have scabs :-(
4301 2018-12-19 17:20:49 All this is by DESIGN!

With the advent of renewable energy sources the writing is on the wall:

“Find something else (instead of oil) to make a ‘diminishing natural resource.”

Potable water will fit the bill nicely!
4302 2018-12-19 17:20:45 
4303 2018-12-19 17:20:44 Plausible for #POTUS45 to #Occupy #Canada given Meng Wanzhou is in Canadian custody because the US want her and Canada has oil. If China threatens Canada, then America to the rescue! Occupied protection & Canadian oil. #conspiracy #drama
4304 2018-12-19 17:20:36 Oil prices always fluctuate but somehow oil revenue  that underpins the UK economy as stated by several UK  chancellor's but would  be a burden for an independent Scotland is very hard to believe
4305 2018-12-19 17:20:31 The CIA started a fight they couldn’t ever win in Syria!!! Russia will start WW3 before they give up the naval port in northern Syria. Trying to over throw the Russian puppet Assad was doomed to fail or start WW3. Follow the oil money/trade and it’s all clear.
4306 2018-12-19 17:20:24 Need that CBD oil mate sending me to cloud 9
4307 2018-12-19 17:20:19 *HUGSSSSSS* Yeah, the whole situation is so infuriating! It sounded awful for you, that night O_O I hope you didn't have to pay too much for the oil change DX

4310 2018-12-19 17:20:15 Love Tatcha, the Camellia cleansing oil is the gateway
4311 2018-12-19 17:20:08 Buy bonds, buy stocks, buy oil, buy gold. Sell vol, dollars.
4312 2018-12-19 17:20:08 I have organic coconut oil I’m always lined up and vitamin e in my purse but I still get itchy  I just rub through it but lord knows I’m dying to scratch and scratch
4313 2018-12-19 17:20:05 How does anyone screw up "striking oil" so badly that tens of thousands of jobs are lost, the oil sells at a 70% discount and now tge industry needs to be subsidized to survive?  #Incompetence
4314 2018-12-19 17:20:04 oh the poor oil barons!
4315 2018-12-19 17:19:43 #crude #oil helping

4317 2018-12-19 17:19:33 Amarjeet Sohi & Jim Carr announced  $1.6 B federal aid package for Canada's oil and gas industry. The money is spread over a variety existing programs to help companies find new markets, invest in clean technology & train staff

on heels of additional $1.6 B in royalty credits
4318 2018-12-19 17:19:31 Since drake and meek cool...

I’m gonna need a @Drake & @RickRoss joint EP. 

4-6 tracks of nothing but that slick talk. 

See: Made Men, Oil Money Gang, Paris Morton Music
4319 2018-12-19 17:19:28 Europe did not get where they are by ignoring resources they had in abundance - coal in Newcastle, oil in Scotland etc. The nutters would have us believe there is no alternative to oil. The Saudis & their Yank mates have not stopped driving 6L SUVs while natives want to save 
4320 2018-12-19 17:19:24 By big oil do you mean BC Coal ?
4321 2018-12-19 17:19:23 D,

Russia needs higher oil so they’re going to create chaos somewhere in region now that they’re unhindered posted up in Syria. Go on offensive somewhere. Bump and run maybe.
4322 2018-12-19 17:19:12 あのまま前半0-0で終わりたかったですよね、後半立ち上がりにガツガツ行って取り合えず1点返して欲しいですね
4323 2018-12-19 17:19:10 ไม่งงๆค่ะ
4324 2018-12-19 17:19:07 “Me and Victoria concluded that Grease is gonna end the world”
“The musical?”
“the oil?”
“The country?”
4325 2018-12-19 17:18:56 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
4326 2018-12-19 17:18:55 Oil lobbyists have the politicians by the balls so nobody is talking about it.
4327 2018-12-19 17:18:48 if you want to give the bath everyday (and use soap each time) you can avoid drying out the skin! some are fine and can do that, but my daughter has bad skin.. so i know you can put baby oil on them about 2 hours before a bath and it helps a ton to not let their skin dry out!! 
4328 2018-12-19 17:18:46 My cuticles  are getting so dry im  hating how my nails end up  even after i clean them and put cuticle oil. 
4329 2018-12-19 17:18:42 Oil prices rose after one of its biggest falls for years, but remained under pressure from oversupply and concern that a slowing global economy would depress demand for fuel.
4330 2018-12-19 17:18:39 I will never understand why the slogan for castor oil isn't "Castor Oil kuzonyiwa Macala"
4331 2018-12-19 17:18:25 It means that against children, the Allied forces are shooting missiles and machine guns. Allied forces are killing children.
If the Allied forces continues the war until they killed all the kids, they are right ? Can the US justify the aid of killing children for oil ?
4332 2018-12-19 17:18:22 He’s trying as hard as he can to force this to be a “Tesla cars only” tunnel.
4333 2018-12-19 17:18:21 Exactly. Like so many other foreign policies of Trump are. His increased sanctions on Iran, Cuba and Venezuela all drive these countries into the arms of Russia. And Russia wants control over the oil/gas/pipelines. Even in N. Korea: Putin wants a pipeline there. Trump helps him
4334 2018-12-19 17:18:19 一瞬でもボールウォッチャーになってしまうとやられる、レベル高い
4335 2018-12-19 17:18:19 my friends,  dont wait to order cbd oil or creams, or even coffee.. order now to get oils before the new year 
message me
4336 2018-12-19 17:18:14 I know. I could've had a lovely evening in the Airbnb, celebrated your birthday with you, used this day I have taken off for work to do Christmas shopping before it gets unbearable in the hight streets, Halfords could have changed my oil rather than the expensive garage . But no
4337 2018-12-19 17:18:09 Oil cooler, new heat plate and MOT
4338 2018-12-19 17:18:08 My bf is coming to my office to get my car to get a oil change 
4339 2018-12-19 17:18:06 As long as SOMEONE OUT THERE likes sprouts, too!

I really don't understand the lack-of-love
Olive oil might just be OK over unsalted butter*

*THIS is my most favourite cooking/baking ingredient
4340 2018-12-19 17:18:05 #TrustFundTrudeau already did a gender impact study and concluded that trucks exude “toxic masculinity” and need to be phased out along with the entire oil and gas industry.
4341 2018-12-19 17:17:59 Of course not,  Our country has a wealth of resources.  We all win (jobs, taxes) when we support Canadian rather than import. For every dollar spent on foreign oil, that’s a dollar going to support someone else’s economy, not Canada’s!
4342 2018-12-19 17:17:59 CBD oil users!...drop your favorite in the comments or DM
4343 2018-12-19 17:17:52 I just want to know when govt is telling increase in tax collections, windfall gain from oil and economy is blooming why it need Rbi coffers to be opened up
4344 2018-12-19 17:17:42 Something that I found to work ladies: sweet almond oil under your eyes at night. Keep those dark circles outta sight
4345 2018-12-19 17:17:42 THERE IS HOPE!!!  no seriously, they seem soooo different. It’s like water and oil. I just hope Lataina wasn’t messing with him when he was with Ari because then that brings her value down, BUT Ari def mad either way
4346 2018-12-19 17:17:39 Thank you for your CBD oil order Donna White
4347 2018-12-19 17:17:36 Following a significant drop earlier in the week, oil prices rebounded, although concerns of oversupply and a slowing economy still dominated the headlines
4348 2018-12-19 17:17:13 in the 21st century racism still exists between all races and every race is racist towards one another, the issue is like oil and water.
4349 2018-12-19 17:17:10 Russia is in recession and oil is under $50. Russia will collapse again.
4350 2018-12-19 17:17:06 To say that Shannan was more capable of murdering those girls than he was is sick. They forgive him do they? Well they have the opportunity to love him...she raised this monster he grew up. He dumped their bodies to rot in oil #cindywatts this is on its own UNFORGIVABLE!!!!
4351 2018-12-19 17:17:06 ‘‘Tis amazing, this time next year, it will be different again. Thank you too, us girlies got to stick together.
4352 2018-12-19 17:16:51 Oh I use conditioner and tea tree oil for that
4353 2018-12-19 17:16:50 aku gatau klo toner tapi aku pake oil nya iya panas
4354 2018-12-19 17:16:39 MCN'S are the snake oil sellers of YouTube
4355 2018-12-19 17:16:39 I hope they did rise.I was pretty gutted by the 15% fall...I  haven't even bothered to see if they bounced back lol
4356 2018-12-19 17:16:37 Not certain running oil tankers into Hudson Bay is on anyone's 'To Do' list. Certainly not any oil companies, Churchill, or Nunavut.
4357 2018-12-19 17:16:34 Check your Engine oil this morning.
4358 2018-12-19 17:16:26 Trump moving #Kurds down the path of oil for blood...
4359 2018-12-19 17:16:16 Does your house of comedy discuss how to make money aside how to share money at the exclusion of NASS workers? 

Your state is a riverine state, with oil resources, but has one of the lowest IGR in Nigeria, only depending on federal allocation.
4360 2018-12-19 17:16:07 Lowest quality oil?? Destroy natural environment?? WTF we have some of the cleanest oil on the planet & make a very limited foot print in getting the oil! Now look at Quebec who gets a lot of their oil from Saudi!! Dirtiest crappy oil there is.
4361 2018-12-19 17:15:56 You forgot record deficit, lower market returns in last 2 yrs than last 2 of Obama & now GOP likes ACA as long as not called Obamacare & oh ya under Obama, US became oil independent. Trump policies r hurting US oil producers. Sorry Facts don’t lie. Sad
4362 2018-12-19 17:15:48  I amazes me how the CBD Oil can make such a difference on an autistic child.
4363 2018-12-19 17:15:44 Yeah. I’m a very “it needs to be useful” person. Like if someone needs a new kettle. Sick. Motor oil? No problem. Infinite amounts of Nutella? Heck yeah! But like, a cute card and an ornament. Nope!
4364 2018-12-19 17:15:29 Im sure a 5 litre container of annointing oil can help you squash this unheard demon. Simple common sense.....how does that green amount to a disputed 50%. Jesu arikuuya uchamama
4365 2018-12-19 17:15:28 Just the malt, spaghetti and the g/nut oil is above that price 
4366 2018-12-19 17:15:25 Wrong. @JustinTrudeau gives a very big damn. He damn well wants to destroy the Canadian oil industry. Who knows what motivates this treasonous behaviour. $80million/day lost to Canadian economy (for now).
4367 2018-12-19 17:15:17 ...Looks to the jurisdiction thereof.” Many people that oil prices are doing. Big Win, and VOTE for his partisans have long
4368 2018-12-19 17:15:16 Also the fact that it isn’t oil free is  the real test is gonna have to come in the summer tbh
4369 2018-12-19 17:15:04 Quebec politicians only after billion $$ money from Alberta oil!!
4370 2018-12-19 17:15:02 The fact the previous government passed a law specifically aimed at making it harder to protest against oil/gas exploration cuts against claims they had no real interest in the sorts of things the spying scandal was about.
4371 2018-12-19 17:14:57 thank you so much!! i literally just panfried it with grapeseed oil!! i read it’s more alkalizing for the body & great for the digestive system! u have to be patient lol took me about 12 minutes or, so panfried each side of the tofu! added fresh garlic & soy sauce at the end! 
4372 2018-12-19 17:14:51 isn't there a glut of oil?
4373 2018-12-19 17:14:50 I read a novel back in the 80s The plot was American invasion of Canada for our water which is far more realistic than one for our oil We already give them all the oil they want
4374 2018-12-19 17:14:46 Wow thank you :’) does this count even if my oil is synthetic?
4375 2018-12-19 17:14:45 To win Su's used tampon, Keitaro must eat 21 dimes covered in olive oil
4376 2018-12-19 17:14:43 Russia wont allow them to take oil fields. If turkey attacks from the north, SAA will attack from the south, by that time ISIS will retake most of north DeZ anyway so they will have perfect excuse.
4377 2018-12-19 17:14:30 What type oil for my Peugeot 406
4378 2018-12-19 17:14:27 Nothing to do with that let's call a spade a spade... It's all about the oil
4379 2018-12-19 17:14:10 If I keep water in a cup, I know the level of the water, if I throw a cloth I know the shape it takes and form if it's touched 
4380 2018-12-19 17:14:05 You know what's a "reliable source of revenue?" The property tax.  Much less volatile than the sales tax, which is the other major source of state/local revenue available to improve public education. Or oil/gas taxes, #txlege #txed
4381 2018-12-19 17:14:04 WTI oil near unchanged after the recent plunge, at $46.41/barrel.
4382 2018-12-19 17:13:59 I get free oil changes at the Honda dealership; therefore, the prime minister of Japan pays my grocery bill.
4383 2018-12-19 17:13:52 You ever cover your hands in oil just to flex on materials that absorb water
4384 2018-12-19 17:13:47 Oh Nutella is TERRIBLE. Mostly palm oil and sugar. I normally keep it very far away from me but my roommate buys it//I eat theirs.
4385 2018-12-19 17:13:37 My fear is that our elections are now corrupt.  So, our votes don’t matter.  The deep state will just cheat to stay in power.  Secession will be our only tool at that point.  We have all the food, water, power and oil.  

All they will have are the criminals, lazy, and stupid.
4386 2018-12-19 17:13:27 Castor oil and a silky head scarf
4387 2018-12-19 17:13:26 Hllary/Trump/Obama, etc they are all puppets, they didn't make the call; Trump reinstated the false flag White Helmet funding. They pulled out because the curtain was pulled back on the show, they can't fake or spin it any more pretending to help people, so oil can flow
4388 2018-12-19 17:13:22 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: spicy crust with moist coconut oil and pineapple.
4389 2018-12-19 17:13:18 I love vitamin E oil in my hair 
4390 2018-12-19 17:13:18 Yes.  And if oil priced in CNY & USD, then a key driver to USD oil price suddenly becomes CNY/USD x-rate.  IOW, if the US wants IP, ISM, Fixed assets, payrolls & GDP to rise, once CNY oil contract began physically settling, it needs USD down, bigly.
4391 2018-12-19 17:13:15 Jonathan is a  air traffic controller that likes Sesame oil on their feta pizza with white wine
4392 2018-12-19 17:13:11 @HalftimeReport lower oil prices a great boost to everyone including business - other than oil profits why would that be anything but a true gift to everyone
4393 2018-12-19 17:13:11 No, they can get loans from a bank and this does not buy rail cars to haul oil nor build pipelines...it’s idiotic but will likely fool most of the media and some Canadians...
4394 2018-12-19 17:13:07 Fina start oil pulling again
4395 2018-12-19 17:13:06 Istg we need to buy them supplements, fish oil or smthg. Otherwise they think fansupport fountain song is Grammys or smthg. Smh 
4396 2018-12-19 17:13:05 God be my witness freaking KRG deserves to be toppled if it doesn't urgently approach YPG and stands by them. You deserve to go to hell if you abandon Rojava. Let PKk be stupid. You have to be the grown up. Help Rojava. Help it. Give the oil to Iraq. Don't send it to Turkey.
4397 2018-12-19 17:12:56 I literally fried plantain without fire because I overheated the oil.  Just some friendly advice, break your phone when you want to fry something. 
4398 2018-12-19 17:12:49 Do you know that you no longer need gas & groundnut oil to fry dodo again? No, you don't. Just log on to Twitter and place your plantain on top of your phone screen.

BE ATTENTIVE, OR UR DODO CAN GET BURNT.
4399 2018-12-19 17:12:48 Oil revenue maybe very optimistic due to a glut and sliding oil prices. What components is others?
4400 2018-12-19 17:12:47 Can fish oil alleviate the effects of head trauma? TCU professor Jonathan Oliver investigates the neurological protections of omega-3 fatty acids. #LeadOnTCU
4401 2018-12-19 17:12:26 The Liberal win will not be a win for Canada. Look at this country now. Quebec doesn’t want Alberta’s dirty oil, BC also not interested so the west needs to fight back to save its economy. There is no unity here, we are a very fractured country.
4402 2018-12-19 17:12:24 CBD oil, Canadian Gov. approved, 3 drops under tongue morning and night. Pain from arthritis helped. That's all I needed. After 5xbypass,I added pot, a sativa  to give me energy & combat pain. Never took OxyContin though prescribed.
4403 2018-12-19 17:12:19 Salad with baby spinach, olive oil, quality sea-salt and tomato sauce. Serve with small portion of grilled deboned beef rib in miso sauce.
4404 2018-12-19 17:12:17 The situation in #AbuleEgba is the fruit of corruption over the decades, having oil pipelines running through residential or commercial centres. Who allowed the Planning Permission of this Oil Pipeline go through AbuleEgba? @azzy_TVCNews @tvcnewsng
4405 2018-12-19 17:12:12 these people are changing the oil in my car and idk if i should get out .
4406 2018-12-19 17:12:12 I really like Philosophy’s microdermabrasion peel two step followed by Hope in a Jar for a moisturizer when I feel like doing a whole routine but for day to day stuff I cleanse and moisturize with coconut oil.
4407 2018-12-19 17:12:11 SHARARA OIL FIELD REOPENED AFTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN FEZZAN RAGE MOVEMENT AND THE PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL
4408 2018-12-19 17:12:10 So now we look at the import of refined petroleum. With approx 7.4 million MTQ in same period, perhaps we've found our reliance on foreign oil?! Alas, that's a negative. 88% of that refined product is once again imported from the US.
4409 2018-12-19 17:12:01 So promoting data..with no profit..is ok..let me guess data supports no Oil Sands industry..right..pls correct me if the data suggest otherwise.
4410 2018-12-19 17:11:59 ไปเถอะ
4411 2018-12-19 17:11:59 an oil pen was the most adult purchase i made this year
4412 2018-12-19 17:11:43 Update: oil pulling is fucking disgusting but yeah, day 3
4413 2018-12-19 17:11:41 I had it happen with a bottom tooth a couple years ago - problem started when we drove up a mountain, ruined my weekend.  I tried clove oil etc thinking it was a tooth, got down the mountain and took a sudafed and felt basically fine in 2 hours.
4414 2018-12-19 17:11:36 レポートやるとか言って支部漁ってた ゴミ…
4415 2018-12-19 17:11:22 Stop pipeline over the wetlands! You are poisoning our waters for money! Boycott fossil fuels and this pipeline! Stick that pipeline up your own backyard! Nobody wants this but big oil and rich assholes greedy for more money! @BayouBridge sucks more than oil!
4416 2018-12-19 17:11:15 Just got some fucking oil on my suede fucking shoes 
4417 2018-12-19 17:11:14 Vajpayee tried to be ..tried selling businesses ..tried oil deregulation...fiscal prudence ..lost..politicians said do hell with it..khud ka dekho
4418 2018-12-19 17:11:10 Time to rethink why we need to be in that region at all.  We've got our own oil now, thanks to Fracking.  Nothing else good comes out of it.  Our greatest Ally does *nothing* for us.  So, there's no reason to be embroiled.
4419 2018-12-19 17:11:04 The bestest interview we could have heard and the potential and the National Significance is all in there. The reasons I have always believed. #ukog
And thank you Mandy for always supporting me with some of the not so nice people on this journey.
4420 2018-12-19 17:11:03 Eat salad. And third macaroon of day. They are packed with palm oil and sugar. Not good.
4421 2018-12-19 17:10:58 I know. I’m trying to do my bit but it’s not easy. Along with the Palm Oil - but it’s in practically everything!
4422 2018-12-19 17:10:57 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia and Russia produce enough oil and there is no excuse. It's easy to finish Iran's crude oil until April. It only wants political will. It just wants to put an end to this blood-thirsty regime once and for all.

#GoAwayBernie scumbag snake oil salesmen
4427 2018-12-19 17:10:50 @francoislegault @JustinTrudeau  Sales of SUVs and big homes are Skyrocketing in #Quebec. Gas and Deisel consumption in QC ranks 2nd in Canada at 355 million barrels per day, (ON is 1st). Only total ignorance would think Import oil is cleaner #AlbertaStrong #SaskStrong @CTVNews
4428 2018-12-19 17:10:48 And with sweet oil

you anointed yourself
4429 2018-12-19 17:10:47 I love it too...just ruined coconut oil for me as I get ALL sexy every time I eat a bounty lol. Xx
4430 2018-12-19 17:10:41 Further to 
1)

Every province can conduct its own environmental review of any project.
At this time Horgan says he will proceed with NEB but he's watching closely.

Christy Clark said they would go with the NEB review but, ummm, she's not the Premier she's an oil salesperson lol
4431 2018-12-19 17:10:33 @realDonaldTrump and they will not sit down until this change. The global financial system must be disconnected from this regime, and until April, Iran's oil exports should reach zero, this delay should no longer be continued, as it is no longer tolerable.
4432 2018-12-19 17:10:32 Says the guy who's leaders profit from the unmonitored pumping of fresh aquifer drinking water for fracking and oil sands extraction. That is the biggest criminal assault on Western Provinces, and on all of Canada. But ignorance is bliss.
4433 2018-12-19 17:10:31 You have been the "keeper of the drain".Please document what you are claiming as it appears to be more flim added to your flam. The market for your brand of snake oil is done.
4434 2018-12-19 17:10:30 Russia is in a recession and oil is below $50. How is Russia winning?
4435 2018-12-19 17:10:24 I don't know who needs to hear this but.... GET A OIL CHANGE.
4436 2018-12-19 17:10:24 @realDonaldTrump is  just doing what your Russian masters want @LindseyGrahamSC. They get Syria and their oil pipeline which is what the whole things about at this point.
4437 2018-12-19 17:10:20 Frankly speaking Bengali cuisine is very different from  South and we need oil. But in blore too I over dosed on puliogere vangibaat

4441 2018-12-19 17:09:54 Mr Say-anything-to-get-elected strikes again. He would have us believe that it is Trudeau's fault that oil prices plunged, that the oil pipeline was denied, that the climate is changing because of the overconsumption of fossil fuels ! You need a reality check or a head shake
4442 2018-12-19 17:09:41 เราก็ผ่านมันมาหลายครั้งแล้วนะ หลายๆอย่าง เวลาและประสบการ์ณมันสอนเราตลอด
4443 2018-12-19 17:09:34 this is such a dumb east coast take/issue.  Houston is chock-full of liberals/leftists who happen to work in Oil.
4444 2018-12-19 17:09:16 In Q3'18, we had a growth rate of 1.8%, driven by non-oil sector. I don't think we necessarily need oil production to hit target to achieved a 3% (although I understand its importance).

I believe increases efforts in the non-oil sector space can still do wonders.
4445 2018-12-19 17:09:13 Yeah it's called the US being the number 1 producer of Oil as of September 12, 2018. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
4446 2018-12-19 17:09:12 I love going to get my oil changed and then being told I have stuff wrong with my Jeep. Gotta get my breaks replaced.

4449 2018-12-19 17:08:59 @realDonaldTrump Tramp has come to finish the work of terrorism, not to continue to help. To do this, all sanctions must be fully implemented and until April, Iran's oil exports will reach zero, no dollars, nine euros, nine liters, no currency should enter Iran

4451 2018-12-19 17:08:55 Hello. Our first commitment is to never purchase it from Indonesia, or any country where it could impact orangutans. Our supplier guarantees our palm oil comes from long established organic palm plantations and small scale farms, in Brazil. We hope this helps answer your concern
4452 2018-12-19 17:08:52 Thank you Netflix for showing me that I've been using crappy olive oil this whole time.
4453 2018-12-19 17:08:15 "Pipeline opponents have tried to force investments in their preferred energy sources by preventing investments in oil and gas. While they have generated headlines, they have not stopped those fuels from getting to market, nor did their actions lead to increases in renewables."
4454 2018-12-19 17:08:13 This is ridiculous how long u gotta wait to get a fucking oil change
4455 2018-12-19 17:08:09 1) oh they damned well do my Gussy ! -- ask Heyman or Weaver -- ask @BCGreens 
2) WRONG !! lol dumbass
3) LNG is a GAS - First nations have signed off on it - look at a map as to why
4) Wash St refineries get oil from Cali and Alaska
5) how stupid are you?

4458 2018-12-19 17:08:05 if oil's not priced solely in USD anymore, what do we care?  No longer solely our problem.  The US DoD budget is as big as it is to ensure foreign demand for USTs.  That hasn't worked for 5 yrs.  Either we need to fight everybody, or declare victory all over the world & come home
4459 2018-12-19 17:08:04 I took some more hemp oil, and I'm already feeling better. Maybe that's what I need to take from now on.

4465 2018-12-19 17:07:43 @Younglionking7 your name on here, “olive oil papa” is almost an anagram of Olivia Pope — coincidence? I think not!
4466 2018-12-19 17:07:38 Honestly, I think Canada could be the wind-farming capital of the Americas, as much open space you've got, especially in Alberta. Take advantage of advancing wind tech and you'll be able to export far more oil as well as quite a bit of clean energy.

4468 2018-12-19 17:07:16 Let Russia buy Sirian oil. I believe we sell them natural gas.. ? So does Germany. We agreed not to put missles near the Russian boarder. We broke this promise. Thanks NATO. Thanks EU. Can't blame Putin for building more nukes and getting ready for war. Looks like we are.

4472 2018-12-19 17:06:57 @BruceStJames @Pamela_Hughes remember the fees came when barrels of oil topped like $150/barrel. They implemented fees to make up for fuel price. Oil went down $47-55/barrel? People kept flying so they kept fees. They have tripled their money and want more... Criminal?
4473 2018-12-19 17:06:54 I got kids too. It sounds harder than it is. It’s actually way easier and faster to clean than regular pots and pans. Think of it like your grill. Takes 2 seconds to wipe out the food, then heat it up with oil takes 2 minutes. No scrubbing, no dishwasher.

4494 2018-12-19 17:05:00 Wow, something that isn't about oil. I'd say ground breaking, but would hate you to lose focus again.
4495 2018-12-19 17:04:51 How much for the Red and gold abaya?
4496 2018-12-19 17:04:45 Oil sure ain't over for Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iraq, the UAE, Iran, and Nigeria. And consumption of oil sure isn't over by top emitters like China, the US, and India. This problem is so much bigger than Canada, so let's get while the getting's good.

4500 2018-12-19 17:03:56 I think you mean bab the import of Saudi oil. "Canada" does not import it; private business does.
4501 2018-12-19 17:03:47 THREAD: For many of us #winter = flu/cold season!
If you or a loved one succumb to it, here is a prescription from yours witch truly:

- Tea tree oil vaporisations: as often as you wish. 3-4 drops in a cup of boiling hot water, inhale *deeply*  (do NOT drink) 9 times.
4502 2018-12-19 17:03:37 Turkey and FSA will not get anywhere near the oil fields, SDF will reach a deal with Damascus or SAA tanks will cross the Euphrates and secure the oilfields themselves. There won't be US troops to stop them, and SDF understands that.

4507 2018-12-19 17:03:00 Shameful depiction of how not to run a government. Budget proposal for 2019 presented in December, budget forecaet on unreal oil prices and oil production (per day)  forecast, and we claim these people mean the best for us. The future is bleak for a whole lot of Nigerians. So sad

4513 2018-12-19 17:02:41 @realDonaldTrump In any case, they were able to postpone a slight boycott of oil but never reached their main goal and failed, our disclosures and the efforts of the Trump government did not allow them to reach their goal; this was their last game to save the regime of Iran.

4515 2018-12-19 17:02:11 With the NDP repeating conservative lies about the oil industry I'm not sure there is a lot of difference. Both parties will lead us to the destruction of our species via climate change.

Did a rogue group of Pharisees appear, accost you on the street, and pour holy oil over your forehead & make you an “instrument” of god?

Arcane stories from ancient shepherds & fishermen are not a solid foundation for critical thinking
4518 2018-12-19 17:01:54 Moreover, data isn't zero-sum in the way oil is. And the consequences of misuse are...getting shown more relevant ads, or being urged to follow a person/business that you're statistically likely too...? Hard to tell if the analogy is more lazy, or stupid.
4519 2018-12-19 17:01:45 @realDonaldTrump and in order to support the Iranian regime, they arranged plans to dismiss Bin Salman, do not be surprised to blow themselves down, because the full boycott of oil is the last stage and the work The regime will end Iran
4520 2018-12-19 17:01:41 Due to tRump telling Saudi Arabia to overproduce, allowing Iran to still put oil out on the market, US shell production, & the overall economy slowing down ... some Xmas presents will be layoffs!

But the capitalist and Israeli systems could not stand this,
4527 2018-12-19 17:01:14  ... the trans mountain oil pipeline will be a big earner too!

Is that publicly traded like The USA, or government owned? Who is going to build it & hold accountability for malfunctions?

Many in the investment market  their pipeline stocks and the dividends paid out!
4528 2018-12-19 17:01:08 maybe he means diversify methods of getting oil to market. like. 
"wow, what a diverse selection of pipelines"
4529 2018-12-19 17:00:58 2019 12.06 million barrels per day USA production and no definite word on cuts from Opec.

4530 2018-12-19 17:00:55 But we have billions in oil money. Your lot in Westminster have been using it as their own personal slush fund for decades. Check out the McCrone report. Moral right?

In late 2018, the capitalist system used all its power to dismiss bin Salman and save the Iranian regime

4542 2018-12-19 16:59:55 Pro-SAA people are so short sighted. Turkey had no qualms with stealing Afrin's olive harvest. What the fuck do you think they're going to do with the oil? lmao
4543 2018-12-19 16:59:51 Anything with an olive oil base, breaks me TF out everytime
4544 2018-12-19 16:59:48 But you did predict a scenario where oil could drop below $50, and it did in fact happen, even though you were a lonely voice in the wilderness at the time, so, kudos to you once again.
4545 2018-12-19 16:59:46 Leduc is where Alberta oil was first found so perhaps it's fitting that Leduc should be the epicenter of new jobs and recovery.
4546 2018-12-19 16:59:40 I was in Houston Texas leading a meeting. My UK manager chose the date (not realizing significance). We were in the oil/gas industry. The meeting participants went to the bar. I watched election returns ALONE in the hotel lobby where a special TV viewing area was set up...

Ignoring it makes us culpable.

4551 2018-12-19 16:59:26 I like argan oil but never really tried coconut or olive oil. The mixture I have is Jamaican black castor, doo gro stimulating oil, and an oil from a Xavierite...idk what it's called but I like the smell.
4552 2018-12-19 16:59:23 잠이  안와
4553 2018-12-19 16:59:10 i think theres recipes that let you use just butter instead of oil but just use canola oil pr vegetable oil if you have it. olive oil is more for like savory dishes and stuff usually likeee pasta maybe. so yea
4554 2018-12-19 16:58:54 China won't have gas cars in 15 years - leading electric charge. 

reality is - oil prices probably won't ever come back. they'll be a need for it, sure, but it can be supplied from Saudia Arabia.

in 2020 the bunker fuel (bitumen) will be banned, jfyi

4559 2018-12-19 16:58:43 My people use it colloquially as a fairly gender neutral term and you definitely fit the bill. If a country is at war and you cut off their supply of oil (this is not in support of imperialist japan) WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK THEYRE GOING TO DO?!
4560 2018-12-19 16:58:30 Somethings that happen in these country leaves "We The People" totally mocked!!! I really cannot understand how millions of ltrs of oil worth billions of money can spill without ANYONE noticing it!! Worse still those charged are released on paltry bail terms! #UnjustJusticeKE!!

4563 2018-12-19 16:58:09 Yes - over there . They’ve been waging war against each other for decades. Let them sort out the mess . With us oil on the rise we don’t need theirs . It was always about the oil anyway...
4564 2018-12-19 16:58:07 My grandma likes tea tree oil. I'll have to jump on her wave.
4565 2018-12-19 16:57:58 Looking at imports of crude oil, as of Oct 2018 (12-month period), only 6% of imports were from Saudi Arabia. 5% from Russia and a smidge from the UK. Majority of import of crude was from the US (88% of imported amount - approx 2.6 million MTQ)
4566 2018-12-19 16:57:57 Is this for coating the pan? I think olive oil should be fine
4567 2018-12-19 16:57:57 His side of the bargain is making sure that the world doesn’t take coordinated, necessary action to eliminate oil and gas usage for at least another 4 years. Sanctions are small potatoes compared to that.
4568 2018-12-19 16:57:50 Parece que el chofer del ciudad de Gálvez se perdió en la Oil de Estación cluselllas.
Si saben algo avisen please que quiero llegar a mi casa
4569 2018-12-19 16:57:49 Its actually Butts that's running the country. Not only is the country run by an unelected person, think about this.Butts is one of the greenest if not the greenest person in Canada.  So in fact we are living under a green party and it sure feels like it.Butts wants to kill oil
4570 2018-12-19 16:57:37 Nope just laughing , and you are triggered over a lame joke ; wow you have issues
4571 2018-12-19 16:57:28 Yass. If you will use oil make sure to wash it. Baka maging irritant pag hinimod niya.
4572 2018-12-19 16:57:25 BC doesn't want one. Are you tone deaf? How can you force pipelines through a province that doesn't want them? What about narrow channels & islands, perfect places for oil spills? You want BC to face the risks while you reap the profits.
4573 2018-12-19 16:57:23 Oil painting sketch .......it's long lasting .....we love you sir ......so far motorcycle in indian market .....
4574 2018-12-19 16:57:21 My next check from Big Oil will be my first.
4575 2018-12-19 16:57:03 ME is #MEcfs or #MyalgicEncephalitis. CBD is Cannabidiol, the main active component of cannabis oil you can buy in health shops (as obvs THC is a controlled substance)
4576 2018-12-19 16:56:59 I love the spirit @clementAbel7 but oil is the key focus, condensate is used for alternate uses and alternate markets that don't fetch as much revenue
4577 2018-12-19 16:56:49 リーガの時よりマルセロ動き悪い感じする
4578 2018-12-19 16:56:47 Lol,
My sister make sure he’s not on Twitter
4579 2018-12-19 16:56:43 Something no one seems to be able to answer - if we had an eastern pipeline with Alberta oil, would gas prices in Atlantic Canada and elsewhere go down? #peipoli #pei
4580 2018-12-19 16:56:42 use canola oil or vegetable oil. im sure you can use olive oil but its gonna taste bad 
4581 2018-12-19 16:56:41 Let's not forget how Turkey facilitated the terrorists. Oil supply from Syria was flowingly freely by Isis until Russia bombed the convoys. Erdogan changed sides when he knew Russia & Iranian help turned around their game. He still can't be trusted
4582 2018-12-19 16:56:40 With all due respect Senator, UK and EU should go and shed their blood for oil pipelines in Syria. We the People are done or they could be Productive and use their taxes and buy oil and gas!.
4583 2018-12-19 16:56:35 Changed my oil and now i have nothing to do :(
4584 2018-12-19 16:56:28 Tough EPS comps in the first half of next year..
-tax cuts from 2018
-oil's 20% decline
-USD 18 month highs
4585 2018-12-19 16:56:27 Things I learned today: Do not wear peppermint essential oil in cold weather
4586 2018-12-19 16:56:26 but but, big oil is now green...... hardy har har
4587 2018-12-19 16:56:20 This just reminded me that I need to get my oil changed
4588 2018-12-19 16:56:18 There's no question that Geo-Politics is at the heart of the collapse in oil prices. Or, more accurately, uncertainty is the culprit.  Trade wars cause a reorganization in the global market place.  The abdication of US leadership only amplifies that uncertainty
4589 2018-12-19 16:56:17 Olive Oil? Is that what you call beer these days, Tony? xD
4590 2018-12-19 16:56:16 Pure water? Gas? Oil? Sand? Rare-earth magnets? Breathable air even? The ice-cap? 

How can you even ask this.
4591 2018-12-19 16:56:09 That oil had me sleeping like a baby last night 
4592 2018-12-19 16:55:55 WELL WHAT OIL DO YOU ISE I JSUALLY JUST USE MILK
4593 2018-12-19 16:55:50 I a big supporter of Big Oil, and big Pharma, too.  Where's my damn check.  I guess you only get a check if you support Big Government.
4594 2018-12-19 16:55:46 Cheap oil is great for me. Screw the fat cats.
4595 2018-12-19 16:55:44 2007 We Were The World's Leader In Solar  Germany Was 2nd And China 3rd. The GOP And Coal & Oil Companies Killed Our Solar Industry Development. Now China Is The World Leader And They Employ 13,000,000 In The Solar Industry. We Gave Away 13,000,000 Jobs To Prop Up Coal & Fracking
4596 2018-12-19 16:55:41 Must be those signs at the boarder
Not the countless hours Mayor Tory spent in discussions or the efforts of the previous Gov
Btw great job convincing OPEC to flood the globe in gas & oil so our costs at the pump stay low

4597 2018-12-19 16:55:40 I’m the type of person to workout once and immediately after, look in the mirror for results. That being said, pretty sure my teeth are whiter after oil pulling for my first time 
4598 2018-12-19 16:55:39 Its great stuff seals everything i once had a lesk on a plastic oil tank so i put dome ct1 on it thinking this will never work but it sealed kerosene until we replaced the tank
4599 2018-12-19 16:55:37 She broke her fast on sardines, fried crisp in pepper oil and served so hot they burned her fingers.
4600 2018-12-19 16:55:30 I hate doing adult things like getting my oil changed in my car. It just takes way too long and costs too much money 
4601 2018-12-19 16:55:27 Shouldn't there be restrictions that prevent the use of lands by oil, coal, or other industries that these lands would need to be protected from, and shouldn't these lands be placed under protections in general for (x) years? Also, why would the bill's fund be limited?
4602 2018-12-19 16:55:26 Baby oil. Then wash or just cut the fur it will grow back
4603 2018-12-19 16:55:23 Oil will most certainly not always be used for those things. Technology constantly improves and getting behind it, rather than pushing against it, is what Alberta needs to do.
4604 2018-12-19 16:55:13 Well needing an oil change go by time or how much you drive...it’s only been a month so it’s gotta be how much you drove lol
4605 2018-12-19 16:55:07 Obama doesn't make mistakes!He based all decisions on many meetings with advisors and burning the midnight oil many nights, anguishing and thoughtfully considering his options. Trump woke up this morning saying "We're out of there!".
4606 2018-12-19 16:55:03 Oh, I have no doubt it's in the name of justice. It's strange how it seems to centre around the oil shipping lines. I wonder if that's got anything to do with it...
4607 2018-12-19 16:55:01 That’s awful. Hopefully the horrible little oil gets what’s coming to him.
4608 2018-12-19 16:54:59 Ur choice! We could have our own tax system minus the carbon tax, our own immigration system not dictated by the UN, negotiate with the east & west to move their goods, trade with the US to use their pipelines at a better price than we’re selling oil now. Endless opportunities!
4609 2018-12-19 16:54:59 I have no idea why they are doing it in the first place...Something big with Iran will put pressure on oil stocks is my best guess
4610 2018-12-19 16:54:52 I done ran through too much coconut oil and conditioner to let one of you bald head bitches sweat me 
4611 2018-12-19 16:54:50 I take CBD oil to help manage my morning sickness. I have even taken edibles with a small amount of THC.

Anti-cannibis hawks, fall on your fainting couches.
4612 2018-12-19 16:54:48 My skin looks fantastic today. My homegirl put some vitamin E oil in my sugar scrub and I'm bout to cuff her
4613 2018-12-19 16:54:45 Military Industrial Complex- Been about 5 to 10 years ago we bumped head into each other...Told you then to retool for something besides weapons.  NOW you see why, the World is going the other way & seeking peace with self & others.  Don't be deluded. MIC+Oil= disaster... Sir
4614 2018-12-19 16:54:43 After this oil change ima go get this cut then take my ass back home
4615 2018-12-19 16:54:35 “And just like the olive , some of you may have felt like you go through the shaking, the beating and the pressing. You went through all of that for your oil to flow. NOW your greater is coming”
4616 2018-12-19 16:54:35 銀髪美少女ですからね……赤の差し色はよく映える
4617 2018-12-19 16:54:32 You think fossil fuels are subsidized heavily by the gov’t??? Where is your proof of this assertion? All operators in Alaska pay significant production royalties, oil taxes, property taxes, and Corp taxes. The only sector that is gov’t subsidized are the so-called renewables.
4618 2018-12-19 16:54:26 made a new skin cleanser/wash outta my favs (peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, vitamin e oil, & Castile soap) This cold air not about to have me dry faced 
4619 2018-12-19 16:54:19 Yes Levittown twin. Winter of 1993 ! was fucking crazy. I was the 1st one to break into to. climbed in the oil burner vent and came out in the womens bathroom. all electricity still work even the pay phone could make and receive calls.

4623 2018-12-19 16:54:05 ok and I did, I drink hella water to keep my skin moisturized and I'm always rubbing some type of oil or Cocoa butter on my stomach like I'm doing at this very moment lol
4624 2018-12-19 16:53:59 The former russian oil company. I'm supprised that no one hss come out with a difinative answer yet.
4625 2018-12-19 16:53:55 Please remind Big Oil to send my paycheck.  There are more than ten years delinquent
4626 2018-12-19 16:53:44 健康体だからこの時間帯に大学行ってるんだけど守衛さんにおはようございまーす！！！><  って言ったら止められました
4627 2018-12-19 16:53:42 Water is probably cheaper than a face oil
4628 2018-12-19 16:53:32 Drinking Malta is drinking carbon oil 
I refuse to die that way.
4629 2018-12-19 16:53:24 Distillate oil demand rose by 418Kb/d on the week to 4.89Mb/d, and is up 849Kb/d or 21% in just two weeks.
4630 2018-12-19 16:53:19 I mean.... if you really wanted to play with it you could run your fingers through her cornrows . Matter fact while you playing put some oil on ya fingers. I know many of us ladies who would greatly appreciate that! 
4631 2018-12-19 16:53:16 You can use olive oil in pancakes right
4632 2018-12-19 16:53:10 Both are good, the main difference is how efficiently your body will absorb the CBD oil. The gummies will need to pass through your stomach etc. before they reach the blood stream. When you place CBD oil under your tounge, it can reach the bloodstream directly. 
4633 2018-12-19 16:53:03 aku butuh loreal extraordinary oil, wish me luck♡
4634 2018-12-19 16:52:57 buy me some leave in conditioner or moisturizer if they have it & momo said she making some oil for our hair to keep the moisture in

4638 2018-12-19 16:52:43 Oil is a huge macro driver, particularly when moves are large within short time period..
4639 2018-12-19 16:52:43 Like them roasted, tossed in the oven with olive oil and salt and pepper.
4640 2018-12-19 16:52:40 Gosh my face is dry, I should add a second oil to my skin care routine. 
*hasnt drank water in a week*
*ate my last vegetable 12 years ago*
*sleeps about two hours a night*
*sipping coffee* 
yeah totally just need that second oil.
4641 2018-12-19 16:52:23 Recent fixes to our economy will make huge changes in the next coming years. Less reliance on oil and more non-oil income are expected to grow dramatically (already doubled many times). After all of that there is no income tax nd we still have very flexible money transfer policiy
4642 2018-12-19 16:52:21 I’ll drink anointing oil 
I’m covered
4643 2018-12-19 16:52:16 If you're doing this in any pan I imagine it's one you don't care about using silverware in bc I don't think I'd ever make scrambled eggs in the same pan fucking oil crayons have ever been in

4646 2018-12-19 16:51:51 Oil up 3% at $47.80
4647 2018-12-19 16:51:50 Capital economics provide some festive cheer..Thanks to the recent sharp drop in oil prices, the fall in inflation in November is likely to be the precursor to a larger fall in December. Inflation could even reach the 2% target, bringing some Christmas cheer to seasonal shoppers.
4648 2018-12-19 16:51:49 So the oil benchmark price is $60 and production is 2.3m barrels. These guys are jokers! When oil is currently trading below $60 and production is at 1.9m barrels. 

Anyways, they can always do roadshow and tap the Eurobond markets to finance the deficit and pile up our debt.
4649 2018-12-19 16:51:45 ExxonMobil, is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is the largest direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, and was formed on November 30, 1999 by the merger of Exxon and Mobil
4650 2018-12-19 16:51:41 I need an oil change man i feel like i just got one last month.
4651 2018-12-19 16:51:38 Doubt they will be building anything in that war torn place. Iraq got rebuilt? Only the oil fields...
4652 2018-12-19 16:51:37 CBD Oil Tip: More than Hemp Oil, CBD Oil & natural flavor in the bottle=diluted oil.

4657 2018-12-19 16:51:12 Just because you produce plenty of oil, doesn't mean you create pollution with it.
4658 2018-12-19 16:51:05 I don’t believe it.

Full withdrawal? Nah.

Israel & Oil Corporate America must have put small print somewhere.

This is a PR stunt for Christmas.
4659 2018-12-19 16:51:05 The classic rock radio station just went from Midnight Oil’s “Beds are Burning” —> LCD Soundsystem’s “Daft Punk is Playing at My House.” What is happening
4660 2018-12-19 16:50:59 If the residents of QC actually support Pipelines & Western Canadian Oil, why do their representatives not? Quebec - We would love you to stand up & voice your opinion as it would really help right now.  
We love the enviro & Canada just as much as you do - let's work together!

4663 2018-12-19 16:50:53 Thank you for educating us about taxes applicable on pol products mr. Producer sitting in turkey , NOW explain by when this decrease in crude oil be reflected in pol prices at the pump (not interested in your debate ... give precise answer or don’t bother replying)

4667 2018-12-19 16:50:30 Scheer is right!  Cancelling would affect Canadian jobs.  Oil is the way to go!
4668 2018-12-19 16:50:25 Yikes. That's a rough outlook. Kind of showcases my point to a T.

Alberta has kept provinces like Ontario and Quebec afloat for a long time thanks to their oil production. The rest of Canada literally owes them aid at this time.

4670 2018-12-19 16:50:16 China has spent the past 10 years saying by their actions "You take the USDs, we'll take the [copper, cobalt, lithium REE, gold, oil, etc.]."  US policymakers thought China was stupid - "Why would they want that stuff when they can have USD's?"  Turns out China wasn't stupid.

⑤ fry ④ in oil
4673 2018-12-19 16:50:06 I’m a student of geology
& this work is totally related to us
So he said it absolutely right
It’s very much possible that gas/oil can leak during drilling.
4674 2018-12-19 16:50:06 Crude yes, what about the refined products from Irving that comes into QC? What percentage of that is AB oil? Since the US imports from Saudi, what percentage of US oil that flows to QC is from Saudi? #askingforafriend
4675 2018-12-19 16:49:51 bro i can’t draw (KSKS IM ACTING LIKE I CAN) while eating. bet that somehow im gonna get sum oiL on my drawing
4676 2018-12-19 16:49:50 The 45th Agenda  is right....Senator Graham want our children to keep fighting  for his oil investments.
4677 2018-12-19 16:49:48 Brad Levine NDP a former Oil lobbyist WTF
4678 2018-12-19 16:49:48 Hope Jeter comes out of recovery soon, I have to get gas an oil change and go to work. 
4679 2018-12-19 16:49:40 They waxed me for a oil changebut fuck it  lol
4680 2018-12-19 16:49:37 Funny dems wanted Troops out of there last year
4681 2018-12-19 16:49:32 Like a Govt owned oil company or bank?

4683 2018-12-19 16:49:25 Yes, YES! With all that Oil wealth you have!!! You'll be just like Venezuela!!!

Oh wait.... #SocialismDoesntWork 

Could use with reading a bit of Hayek and Friedmann @NicolaSturgeon I'd serve you and Scotland well! #Freedom #Brexit #NoDealBrexit
4684 2018-12-19 16:49:24 For sure and in the mean time we also need to sell oil until there are replacements is all we are saying. Canadian oil is cleaner than any other in the world. Not a single producer in the world matches our standards. Not even close.
4685 2018-12-19 16:49:21 Garlic prevents infection

Also clove oil i heard is the best for pain
4686 2018-12-19 16:49:19 No I don’t agree about diet - I’m healthier than I’ve ever been. And cattle production is obviously devastating for the environment (I saw your Iceland palm oil tweet so clearly you care). I do what I do for the planet as well as animals.
4687 2018-12-19 16:49:19 Can I suggest @Everton? Quite a lot of Everton fans support @ManUtd also so . If not what about @ManCity? A lot more f city fans used to be united fans before the oil money so you might be OK there? Just a suggestion 
4688 2018-12-19 16:49:14 The old "lets hate quebec" speak goes over well with your uneducated rednecks. The use of oil in Quebec & equalization payments are not new issues. The fact is you had a chance to influence the Alberta/Quebec relationship when you were in cabinet, again, you did NOTHING!
4689 2018-12-19 16:49:14 Haha sige ah promise yan! Haha lagi dulok sakin o kaya nalulunod sa oil hahaha
4690 2018-12-19 16:49:14 Can you guys do one without Emery’s PSG days? I think having an oil emirate as your primary backer gives you a slight advantage...
4691 2018-12-19 16:49:10 As opposed to the Billions that would be lost by the oil/gas sector if they admitted their industry is responsible for the largest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions out of any other industry? Acting like it isn't 'that bad' isn't helping at all.
4692 2018-12-19 16:49:10 Since the USA became the world largest oil producer only recently, I think it is underestimated how much US interest rates are now correlated to #oil prices.
4693 2018-12-19 16:49:08 Let's just import the rape oil shall we? And not forgetting the excellent rape seed meal for livestock
4694 2018-12-19 16:49:07 Guys! Sa mga bumabiyahe pa ngayon, doble ingat po sa may C-5 bandang Market! Market! May oil spill sa kalsada at marami na motorista na naaksidente sa area. Ingat and ride safe mga sir/ma’am!
4695 2018-12-19 16:49:03 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
4696 2018-12-19 16:49:03 Or, you have the lowest quality oil currently on the market and the rest of Canada is under no obligation to destroy out natural environment to help you sell it.
4697 2018-12-19 16:49:02 Yes, and this argument is wrong, because people notice rising prices. The Gilets Jaunes began protesting after a rise in crude oil prices.
4698 2018-12-19 16:48:55 Those bottles of g.nut oil no follow o. I sure say no be the ones scooped from the gutter from  a fallen oil tanker? I no chop abeg. Carry go forward ma.

4700 2018-12-19 16:48:47 The ‘value’ of coal, oil and gas companies generally takes into account their as-yet-unused reserves. But most of those reserves can’t ever *be* used as doing so would pretty much kill off our species. This is why we need to disinvest from fossil fuels. #divest @divestherts
4701 2018-12-19 16:48:46 I don’t believe USA is fully withdrawing from Syria.

Israel and Corporate America (Oil Corporate America) must have put small print somewhere.
4702 2018-12-19 16:48:38 Oh i'll have to look up the chalk traps, thanks. I've upgraded to pure cinnamon oil to try to keep the ants out but they're pretty aggressive still & managed to find their way through cracks. I think it's the new area I moved my hives to, tons of ants
4703 2018-12-19 16:48:30 When their "elected" leader routinely speaks of annihilating America and Israel, when they sit on billions of gallons of oil but seek nuclear energy for their power crisis, when they have been show numerous times to be a state sponsor of terror, only a fool says they are allies.
4704 2018-12-19 16:48:28 oil prices have gone down further, but govt naisulako fye. they should respect us please

4706 2018-12-19 16:48:15 It was a huge joke , he said he has directed NNPC to that effect, no key policy reforms for the oil and gas industry. Just dictatorial approach 
4707 2018-12-19 16:48:09 ‘Oil is people!’
4708 2018-12-19 16:48:08 Obama's “We're leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq" speech was at least as disastrously wrong and premature as Bush's "Mission Accomplished" fiasco. Still, we should just pull the hell out of the whole and region and pump more oil here.
4709 2018-12-19 16:48:07 Hhhhhh these people don't understand economy at all. Saudi has very low debit compared to other countries and has huge money reserves, stable currency and very strong banking system. As well, it is the biggest oil producer and has forth of oil reserves.
4710 2018-12-19 16:48:06 do u have baby oil or micellar water or something
4711 2018-12-19 16:48:04 Go away.
I have no interest in your snake oil.
4712 2018-12-19 16:48:02 So $FDX and Oil look like crap.

4714 2018-12-19 16:47:42 We don't care what UK ministers say. UK Govt should remove themselves from ongoing GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra and go get their oil pipelines in Syria if they so choose. We the People are done.
4715 2018-12-19 16:47:35 @StoreCupboardCP Hiya! I'd like to know if you do olive oil refill by any chance? Many thanks
4716 2018-12-19 16:47:18 I need an Essential Oil diffuser
4717 2018-12-19 16:47:08 I'm far more worried about the workers, families, & communities than anything else. Trudeau has no understanding of the pain & upset cancellation would cause. So complete the contract; and promote/incentivize #EnergyEast to rid Canada of supertanker oil & create AB jobs as well.
4718 2018-12-19 16:47:07 it’s oil central

FUCK
4719 2018-12-19 16:47:03 BUT SURELY those curves are there for left-turning bicyclists, to ensure one's front wheel hit the rails right perpendicular ? Just in case of rain or oil on the track ?....

4721 2018-12-19 16:46:57 It has soybean oil which clogs pores and isn’t great for acne prone skin. It’s as moisturizing as coconut oil 
4722 2018-12-19 16:46:51 Please share the facts as to what we're doing in Syria in the first place?

The real facts.

Assad is an elected President. His people love him. 

Oh, I remember, BO didn't like the Christian part, so he made up 
sh!t abt fake gassings.

It's abt an oil pipeline & land-grabbing.
4723 2018-12-19 16:46:50 Peppermint oil ..it has a million uses ! It helps me with tension headaches , can perk you up , cancels out all kinds of icky plane smells and mixed in with your lotion or oil it’s very soothing . I also travel with lavender oil 
4724 2018-12-19 16:46:47 Smuggling of liquefied gas (#Belarusian #oil company)  from Belarus to a number of EU countries is increasing .

4725 2018-12-19 16:46:40 I still think the funniest moment I ever experienced in the cod community was the oil and water conversation
4726 2018-12-19 16:46:34 My prayer this morning is that God gives me the oil of His presence and the fire of His spirit. I need more of you Jesus 
4727 2018-12-19 16:46:33 Nothing will ever be enough.    Albertans want it all.   
Living in fantasy -  Dwindling oil prices and increase in climate change awareness and support for alternative energy sources, don’t deter them. We easterners remember “let the eastern bastards freeze”.  0 support from us.
4728 2018-12-19 16:46:26 ORS Olive Oil edge control. Kinda waxy but it doesn't flake like a lot of others

4733 2018-12-19 16:45:59 Ha ha! That hadn't even occurred to me. 

Fuck it. Let'em do it. We'll take one of their barrels of oil and bend them over it.

4735 2018-12-19 16:45:56 I don't know enough about how that connects. My guess was infiltration of Turkish money laundering and selling oil to ISIS.
4736 2018-12-19 16:45:55 I'm sorry, but the whole "green thing" was just a diversion to get Progressives to vote for her & help Trump win,so we could have the whole "oil, charcoal, concrete, plastic & toxic chemical thing" instead.
4737 2018-12-19 16:45:51 Father lord, I need just one through pass into the oil and gas industry in Nigeria, I won't disappoint, I promise

4742 2018-12-19 16:45:33 I suggest taking stock of every item in the home, at work if working, and transportation to see just how many are manufactured using oil, gas, and/or coal.

The idea that we as a human race can walk away from them as an energy source is ridiculous at best ludicrous at worst.
4743 2018-12-19 16:45:32 Wth is this oil change taking a year to do

4748 2018-12-19 16:45:12 Shame on our Fed  government  for bailing out the Oil industry when our First Nations people are in dire need of clean safe water . People first not the rich oil  industry.
4749 2018-12-19 16:45:12 Fighting Popped epidemic, US oil production all- time high, withdrew US from Paris Climate Accord, created US Space Force, on and on and on
4750 2018-12-19 16:45:04 Jason do you honestly think that energy east pipeline would not save eastern oil purchasers money? The fact that polititions at both federal and provincial level are stepping in to stop the flow of ethically produced Alberta  and Saskatchewan oil is the issue.

4753 2018-12-19 16:44:46 Announcing new equipment to oil industry does nothing to sell the product. Solution ,is to expand customer base. And get the pipelines  completed to improve shipping.
4754 2018-12-19 16:44:45 bio oil has gotten rid of all of my scars except for the raised ones!!!!

4756 2018-12-19 16:44:34 UBS: So, while we believe oil prices will rebound and remain positive on USD  sovereign bonds and the Canadian dollar (versus the Australian dollar),  choppy markets offer no grounds for complacency. We will continue to  monitor developments in the oil market closely. #CAD #USD
4757 2018-12-19 16:44:26 Why federal support? Why international support?
Balouchistan is a game changer. U have gawadar the deep sea port. You have CPEC the trillion dollars investment is in process. You have mines of gold and other mineral. You have resources of natural gas and oil.

4758 2018-12-19 16:44:22 Lies... ISIS has not been defeated. You must have gotten scolded by Putin for not leaving yet so he can take all the Middle East and the Oil.

4760 2018-12-19 16:44:13 @CdnCouchPotato Hi Dan. Investing in a Canada ETF is basically investing roughly a fifth of my money in oil. How is this morally justifiable in 2018? I guess that's more of a comment than a question. Love your podcast, thanks.

4767 2018-12-19 16:43:23 My Dad taught me how to change the oil in a car as well as to bake a chicken, I played w/GI Joes & Barbies, every parent should be teaching genderless skills & play to their kids, it makes them much more flexible & able to get along w/others in the world

4771 2018-12-19 16:43:06 They built from low stocks. A lot of oil on water built is Iranian. China is the only place big enough that people can throw misc at and no one can argue against it
4772 2018-12-19 16:43:04 found some oil stuff from a pharmacy that you put in your ear for a few mins to separate any wax abit. i put mine in for 30 mins and then used a water flosser to clear my ear out hahahaha 
4773 2018-12-19 16:42:57 This is a patent lie. I cannot stand uninformed and clearly uneducated rubes like you. Btw, I missed the part when you/ your parents put the oil in the ground that we are so fortunate to have
4774 2018-12-19 16:42:57 See we can agree on something "change is constant" but the oil sands is really dirty and it takes a lot to refine it. There is no such thing as clean coal so we need to move away from it and seek better alternatives.
4775 2018-12-19 16:42:52 $ENSV I've cut my position by 75% since theres no bottom in sight oil broke 50 and management refuses build confidence with communication
4776 2018-12-19 16:42:51 You have to wonder. The tantrum is driven by the fact that they don't have sufficient access to deep water ports, so they can't move oil. I'm not sure how literally cutting themselves off from the parts of the country that do have those ports really improves the situation.
4777 2018-12-19 16:42:51 แต่นุ้งบิลก็คือน่ารักกกกกกกก เฮอออออออ
4778 2018-12-19 16:42:44 Oil prices stage micro-rally as US EIA reports third weekly inventory draw in a row. However, overall, inventories are still 7% above the 5-yr avg.

4790 2018-12-19 16:41:24 I've got a message in a bottle written in gas and oil.
4791 2018-12-19 16:41:15 Or, Maybe the oil industry could slow down a little until the infrastructure is in place.  Maybe no more drilling without the infrastructure in place FIRST.  It’s not like there is currently a shortage of oil!  Check the current price for ND oil!  About $20 per barrel.
4792 2018-12-19 16:41:15 This statement is a nonsense that India is stealingour oil
4793 2018-12-19 16:41:13 If you think *tHe rUsSiAnS* have more influence over our political systems and government than the oil and gas industries, I have a bridge I’d like to sell you.

4797 2018-12-19 16:40:46 Is this a oil based product
4798 2018-12-19 16:40:36 Port Arthur LNG, LLC, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, and the Polish Oil & Gas Co. (PGNiG) entered into a definitive 20-yr sale-and-purchase agreement for LNG from the Port Arthur LNG liquefaction-export facility under development in Jefferson County, Texas.

4800 2018-12-19 16:40:34 This guy is so stupid. Why is he invited to tak on oil exploration when his own background is in civil engineering.
4801 2018-12-19 16:40:33 The U.N. will be ecstaticaly happy to take control of Venezuela & it's oil while indoctrinating its population into a Socialist one world gov't mindset.

4806 2018-12-19 16:40:21 No to Beto.  Read about his record in Congress.  He votes always for the oil and gas industry; is a corporatism; he is a Clintonista; refuses to join the Progressive Caucus.  I will admit he is personable but he is not what your country needs.
4807 2018-12-19 16:40:20 I have a friend who gloated over his knowledge of this, then blew his engine up because he didn’t know to change his oil.
4808 2018-12-19 16:40:06 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
4809 2018-12-19 16:40:05 I do not understand. Can mr Trump so called president make this decision all by himself??? Where is house and senate in this? The decision, like so many of Trump's foreign policies, only helps Russia (and Turkey). Russia wants and is taking over the Syrian oil and gas sector.
4810 2018-12-19 16:40:04 As @NC_Governor and @NCDEQ @Michael_S_Regan roll out a new #climate plan, it’s worth remembering #Cooper’s & NCs Growing grassroots opposition to offshore oil drilling is part of this effort: oil drilling threatens our coastal economy AND our climate #ncpol #ncga
4811 2018-12-19 16:40:03 On @PodSavetheWorld today they talked about how the yellow vest movement isn't against climate change policy. It's against taxing the PEOPLE. We should tax oil executives. OBVIOUSLY. Why isn't this common knowledge??????? #YellowVests #climatechange
4812 2018-12-19 16:40:02 $USO is different. I was looking at oil futures ( $CL1! ) which goes off west texas oil (wti crude oil), which is $USOIL ... on the 4 hour chart, just noticed I cropped that part out.
4813 2018-12-19 16:39:54 My biggest regret is that I didn’t. I had my bloodwork and ear checked and teeth cleaned like three times. And now I have to floss and switch to grape seed oil instead of canola. Im basically Early Man wary of saber tooth tigers preying on me.
4814 2018-12-19 16:39:42 Shoot I'll need to buy more oil at this rate

4819 2018-12-19 16:39:16 Unless you are proposing offshore wind farms, this appointment is meaningless. You old people keep focusing on oil when it truly is time to be responsible citizens of planet Earth and let that industry die off. Renewable Energy is the FUTURE. If you don’t get that, step aside.

4823 2018-12-19 16:38:29 I agree but Alberta decided long time ago to go all oil. It was a stupid idea and they pay for it now.

4827 2018-12-19 16:38:21 There is nothing to boast about it...did you not do the same thing in 2014? When you know Oil prices and exchange rates are not in your control, why do you make an issue out of it? The above tweet of your shows your lack of understanding of fundamental understanding
4828 2018-12-19 16:38:20 Yes. Do cigarettes interact with marijuana or CBD oil? Is there any way or reason to encourage someone to stop smoking cigarettes when they're already recovering from back surgery and nerve pain in their feet? The impact of smoking in the house on kids isn't incentive enough.
4829 2018-12-19 16:38:20 Government can ban or tax foreign oil importation.
4830 2018-12-19 16:38:12 Yeah make sure you rinse off the noodles to make them all nice and wet. Then after that apply the oil and give it a good rub down with your spoon.

4833 2018-12-19 16:38:08 Prof. you are looking at the single point oil price. The budget always says "Average Oil Price" The Average Oil price for the year is still near $70.  Today it could be $40 and tomorrow $65, where you worry like 2015 is where it stays low for greater part of the year.
4834 2018-12-19 16:38:06 How much did big oil pay him for the retweet?
4835 2018-12-19 16:38:04 tbh my skin was the best when i used to use coconut oil
4836 2018-12-19 16:37:48 the man at the car shop asked me what oil I wanted and u bet I said “let me call my dad”
4837 2018-12-19 16:37:44 Someone has to speak for all these oil barons I guess...
4838 2018-12-19 16:37:41 Solar is not sustainable, the rare earth minerals required to build them are well rare and the mining and processing of them is as bad for the environment as drilling and burning oil, just in different ways.

Wind is far too unreliable, a low producer and windmills have a short
4839 2018-12-19 16:37:19 $XOP Large 900K prints $27.89 Bullish above $28.37 Bearish below $27.50 Oil and Gas
4840 2018-12-19 16:37:18 So the cons were in power for40 years when oil was over$100 a barrel. And didn’t save $$ but it’s the fault of the NDP, who have only been in power for4 yrs with oil at less than $50 a barrel.  But the NDP overspend.
4841 2018-12-19 16:37:15 We got tax cut..  North & South Korea shook hands & took down some barbed wire.  No ambassadors murdered in Benghazi. Chinese will buy more soy beans. Some corps. repatriated. Iran rec'd as enemy again. Jerusalem is capital of Israel . No Paris Accord. Oil price hurting Putin ..
4842 2018-12-19 16:37:10 Chemo and I are both on CBD oil with great results. I hope you get the relief you so very much deserve!
4843 2018-12-19 16:37:08 i first i thought you had two in the back there XD
4844 2018-12-19 16:37:06 I've been in here for quite some time now, about 3 years I think (3.14 for a fair few).........just sat waiting.......it's the IOW I'm really looking forward to.
4845 2018-12-19 16:36:52 Got oil changed at VALVOLINE on winchester...all "brothers" ...all i can say is oil light still on and CAR still ticking like it needs oil change.
ANY THOUGHTS.

4848 2018-12-19 16:36:41 Haha one would think but I’m pretty sure I’ve heard both teen talwar and three swords over the decades.
4849 2018-12-19 16:36:30 Simple calculation: any unrest in meddle east will raise crude oil prices and friends of Trump will love it. FYI US is now no. 1 producer.

And best part of that crude price rise will be, nobody will blame Trump for that.

US in not bothered about gulf as it was during nineties.
4850 2018-12-19 16:36:25 I don't want a #PeoplesVote , I want #A50 withdrawn then, when the enraged hordes spill out onto the streets, I want them rounding up and rendered into oil, so that decent people can keep warm this winter.
4851 2018-12-19 16:36:21 The foundation on which our budget is continually being built seems to be faulty. And when will the bench mark for forecast be away from $OIL
4852 2018-12-19 16:36:18 The revenue projections for that 2019 budget were unadulterated jokes. 

Whoever is telling you that we are in a major shift in oil prices is just lying to you. $60 per barrel?
4853 2018-12-19 16:36:13 Obama also took money from Kaiser Permanente ($1.1 million), and Microsoft ($1.7 million), and what resulted from his terms in office were Obamacare and firm Net Neutrality designations. Who’s to say that Beto wouldn’t take oil money and turn it into renewable energy programs?
4854 2018-12-19 16:36:07 NO ITS OIL PASTEL BUT THEYRE SIMILAR!!

4857 2018-12-19 16:35:57 Federal govt blocked the pipelines Alberta needed to get oil to market. As a result Canada is weaker.
4858 2018-12-19 16:35:43 I have shit that I can’t remember changing the oil last on. Will you come up and start on 3 4020s?

4861 2018-12-19 16:35:33 Hey Retired Guy, Stephen Harper helped complete Enbridge Line 9 reversal, ensuring western oil made it to Quebec, the Maine line brought US imports up to 57% of QC needs. Harper is the reason Saudi oil has been reduced to 6-8% since 2015-16.
4862 2018-12-19 16:35:30 semacem baby oil tapi lebih berkelas gt hhhh
4863 2018-12-19 16:35:21 Hang on, Big Oil find then shot his muck  I will go with that 
4864 2018-12-19 16:35:17 He said National Significance...that was why i brought in.
4865 2018-12-19 16:35:15 Been thinking about the economy lately... have a few macro questions:

Do you think the tech sector has a chip on its shoulder? Does the marijuana industry needs to slow it’s roll? Is oil primed for a slick comeback in the next couple years?
4866 2018-12-19 16:35:11 So you're saying oil is going below $0? :)
4867 2018-12-19 16:35:10 Sitting at the dealer waiting on my car, getting the oil changed and back breaks checked.
4868 2018-12-19 16:35:08 My baby got a new battery, the belt, new tires, and an oil change. She’s feeling so good

Or am I completely wrong  I go on vitamin "healthy kicks" way too often
4871 2018-12-19 16:34:55 It´s shameful for an oil-rich country like Nigeria failing to provide one´s basic needs, for all you out there promoting the idea that oil and gas is automatically 'welfare', but also those who complain how bad we have it in the West, grow the f*ck up
4872 2018-12-19 16:34:53 kinda sebab oil sleanser bukan just untuk make up, but also for kotoran yang melekat kat muka kita sebab everyday kita ke hulu ke hilir buat kerja
4873 2018-12-19 16:34:51 @JustinTrudeau now that you have been played like (Fidel) by USA to arrest a Chinese Business women too piss off  one of our offshore oil markets. 
Or were you played at all. Closing another door for our Oil too handcuff Alberta.
4874 2018-12-19 16:34:50 Well if we hadn’t created them in the beginning we wouldn’t have this issue. How about concentrating on not destroying Middle Eastern countries so the usual Criminals get rich. Oil, sex trafficking, arms & drugs. ENOUGH
4875 2018-12-19 16:34:48 Actually fox and every other news outlet has reported these crimes, that are actual crimes with actual indictments. Not surprised at all the only person agreeing with you and liking your comments is a snake oil salesman. Must just sense a gullible woman  he can sell his hgh to.
4876 2018-12-19 16:34:44 mom just recommended CBD oil to me! WHAT IS HAPPENING!? WHERE DID MY TRADITIONAL FAMILY GO!?

4879 2018-12-19 16:34:32 While you may be correct in saying this feed is importated from less than sustainable operations I would argue that the majority of it is imported as byproduct of another process ie palm oil production, where agriculture is not the main driver and is using a cheap waste product.
4880 2018-12-19 16:34:28 Slashing Saudi oil would definitely send the message to the greedy sand fleas. They can purchase the vehicles elsewhere.
4881 2018-12-19 16:34:27 @NeedlesOnNews

Word is a lot of GDLS suppliers aren't getting paid.

4890 2018-12-19 16:33:31 Ask him why there’s no Carbon Tax on Saudi oil if you have the courage, but I doubt you do. MSM will pepper Trudeau with marshmallow questions.
4891 2018-12-19 16:33:30 That’s correct, it washes the cylinder walls and could eventually cause engine to ‘make oil’ which is something you definitely don’t want.

4896 2018-12-19 16:33:15 From 2010 to 2015 I put together oil and gas conferences for a living. One of the nice things about getting out of that business is I don't have to read Jack Mintz anymore.
4897 2018-12-19 16:33:01 Sa oil
4898 2018-12-19 16:33:00 want to see you if some country invades yours for oil 
4899 2018-12-19 16:32:54 Yeah, I think he and McCain just assumed perpetual war would keep money and oil flowing. It may have worked for awhile but it seems like many are weary of the wars.
4900 2018-12-19 16:32:37 Or oil?
4901 2018-12-19 16:32:36 Just like a star across my sky, just like an angel of the page, you have appeared to my life, feel like im never be the same. Just like a song in my heart, just like oil on my hands ohhhhhh I do love youuu. Still i wonder why it is?
4902 2018-12-19 16:32:35 More fun if its slippery, plus no annoying baby oil cleanup.
4903 2018-12-19 16:32:30 Global warming phenomenon was tailored by conspirators the main aim being to phase out the oil industries and refineries because of having denied investment access therein.
4904 2018-12-19 16:32:23 That’s irrational. In that case, if that were true, no one wins. No one has anything to gain. I am sorry to say that Serbia’s relationship with Russia puts no one at risk. Serbia is not a world power and they are not rich in oil or other natural resources. In other words totalno
4905 2018-12-19 16:32:16 HOW CAN WE FIX THIS COUNTRY? 
A country that is blessed abundantly with crude oil, so far had spent N2.6trn on fuel import in just 9months & still spending billions on subsidy! 
Why is our own crisis different from that of a whiteman?
4906 2018-12-19 16:32:13 Richard pryce is a Russian Troll!  Anyone having health coverage under the Affordable Care Act knows how much they are benefiting!  It’s Putin who is banking profits from Trump.  Trump is giving control of Syria and The Middle East to Russia! Now watch oil prices $$$$$$$$
4907 2018-12-19 16:32:07 And that is exactly the point. This is a targeted raid on canadian oil and gas productivity, specifically and pointedly. It is no accident. It is organized, extremely well-funded and motivated.
4908 2018-12-19 16:32:05 Since the start of the Syrian war the west mindset was regime change they had intentions of being a partner of peace they tried to carry out the Israeli agenda to annex the Golan, stop Hezbollah/Iran influence in syria also loot syrian oil/artifacts.
4909 2018-12-19 16:32:01 We are not handing our country over to foreign powers!!...
for the first time in 75 years we are not relying on the Middle East for oil  bc we are using our own resources!
Notice the gas prices dropping???
4910 2018-12-19 16:31:34 I disagree strongly with leaving the Kurds defenceless with Erdogan poised to attack them, but you have to admire the fact that Trump is leaving a country with oil.

4924 2018-12-19 16:30:09 No.  Too low.  My a lot.
EUR too high means assuming too much oil flowing from the well by life's end.

4926 2018-12-19 16:29:53 I agree, I hope Kurds now understand this is not possible, as a Turkish invasion of the oil rich areas is not good for the Kurds or for the Syrians.

4932 2018-12-19 16:29:30 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: burning crust with spicy motor oil and pulled pork.
4933 2018-12-19 16:29:25 I will agree with you.  The risk is to the downside for Oil. 
4934 2018-12-19 16:29:24 IMHO the oil industrymade canada way to alberta centric over the past two decades.
Canada is much bigger then the oil patch.
In the coming economic crisis oil will have a much smaller role to play then it did over the last century.
4935 2018-12-19 16:29:13 Saturated fat from animal sources are by far the healthiest fats for human beings. We need these to manufacture Cholesterol which is the building block for the majority of the hormones in body. Olive oil has some health benefits if you can find a trusted source for it
4936 2018-12-19 16:29:10 @realDonaldTrump Bet you miss Janet Yellen!! And oil is too low!!!!
4937 2018-12-19 16:29:04 Approve!He's going hard-left while the world goes hard-right.Crazy and concerning to see how many responses are pro-Trump; must be hard-core anti-immigration and racist (un-Canadian).Lots of Albertans too; maybe they shouldn't have put all their economic eggs in one basket (oil)
4938 2018-12-19 16:28:47 Guess what JP...I am not going to watch it yet.

4951 2018-12-19 16:27:42 Getting my blood pressure checked today at the doctor. Lunch? Vitamin D, fish oil, tuna, banana chips, dried blueberries & tons of water. Also built in time before to meditate in the car since the drive is always stressful. I do NOT want to have a med added...
4952 2018-12-19 16:27:36 #Oil isn't just going to snap back after this washout. I'd give it 2 months to settle
4953 2018-12-19 16:27:34 If we're unnecessarily editorializing, it should read "Current TV, his failed television station he sold for half a billion dollars to a theocratic dictatorship whose wealth comes entirely from oil".
4954 2018-12-19 16:27:29 I wasn't that lucky. I overclocked as much as I could, but still couldn't get enough speed. So I clustered 4, with an oil cooling system. It was a fun project.
4955 2018-12-19 16:27:26 2019-budget is 90% oil dependants and 70% recurrent expenditure.
Hence, it's worrisome. #JH
4956 2018-12-19 16:27:26 Even if US leaves, there are 72 other nations in the Coalition and also Israel who have an interest in stopping an Iranian Hegemony.

Plus, Turks are planning a massive invasion to seize Syrian Oil and kill Kurds and anyone else in their way.

4960 2018-12-19 16:27:14 US supplied arms to Syrian "moderate" (what a joke!) rebels to overthrow Assad so Netanyahu, Rothschild etc can get their hands on oil in Golan Heights via their Genie Oil Co. Many in US have admitted this fact. Russia did more to eliminate ISIS in Syria

4964 2018-12-19 16:26:47 @tferriss go inland & hit up a winery. I reco Herdade do Esporaõ. Amazing wine and olive oil, Michelin eatery onsite. Another M star spot in Lisboa: Snack Bar. Crazy good experience. Drive to Casais. You can stand at the western-most edge of Europe on a cliff. Rad. #timinportugal
4965 2018-12-19 16:26:44 Cooking oil and Ketchup. 

Experiment. By me
4966 2018-12-19 16:26:43 So, is the market ready for the Fed and another rate hike today?  With the drop in oil equaling lower input costs for many industries, the question will move to inflation. Lower oil will put more money in consumers hands & they will worry bout inflation on that end..hmm what 2 do
4967 2018-12-19 16:26:38 America is far from being the greatest country in the world when it kills children for oil
4968 2018-12-19 16:26:38 Yes, because our country's economy wasn't strong before Bush Sr sent us to the middle east for oil. All these wars are "Oh hey, let's force democracy on other countries who thrive better without it. Let's force them to give us oil while we're at it and let our people die for it"
4969 2018-12-19 16:26:37 I understand that. In my field tho, resumes lie. This current company only hires “senior” guys...and oooh weeee some nillas lied. 

I’ve worked with “degree” ppl in the oil & gas industry. By far the bozos of the bitness.
4970 2018-12-19 16:26:36 Have you tried cannabis oil??
4971 2018-12-19 16:26:32 Well, good luck with that. First Nations will carve up the province because it's all Treaty lands. You may end up with Calgary, if they're generous.

Investors will be scared off, others will never come.

BC already doesn't want oil tankers, so they'll be pleased.
4972 2018-12-19 16:26:30 Isn't it dangerous to cook with olive oil?
4973 2018-12-19 16:26:24 What about all oil based economies that'll be defaced.. huge liquidity drain in the world banking system..good luck..
4974 2018-12-19 16:26:24 @catsu cat
4975 2018-12-19 16:26:19 Sir, if we were as important to you politically as ON or QC, you would've already done this and much more to help. U could make the argument for #CDNEnergy. We imported 29 mil tonnes of oil last yr, ~20% from Saudi Arabia. But it's easier to let us hang and guarantee re-election
4976 2018-12-19 16:26:09 Looks like vegetable oil.
4977 2018-12-19 16:25:58 The #Kurds know they have to make a deal with #Damascus, they won't be able to keep occupying Syria's oil reserves and infrastructure. They need to do something they haven't done so far ...engage their brains for peace.
4978 2018-12-19 16:25:52 I also think that tests are being done to oil the mechanism well before going live. Nobody can afford to make mistakes. Maybe they are using "virrual" XRPs
4979 2018-12-19 16:25:49 I miss the time when I can cook my eggs using olive oil. Damn that was such a boujee time in my life.
4980 2018-12-19 16:25:48 You logic is, there must be oil so choice is AB or Saudi. Wrong. Eastern Canada already gets 80% of oil from North America.  2-3% from Saudi.
4981 2018-12-19 16:25:48 Wrong on health care, I live in Canada and although improvements needed, way more effective. Medical bank’cy doesn’t exist. Don’t care which party you blame, 40k deaths are ridiculous. NRA, Pharma, Oil/Coal money holding politicians ransom. Voter suppression, give u head shake.
4982 2018-12-19 16:25:37 Oh i know why, it's because you lot can't do anything without the Oil that cones from that region so can't afford to say anything bad about them. Itibolibo
4983 2018-12-19 16:25:32 Hey Koushik, glad you've brought this to the notice of the respective oil companies. Have you tried talking to the person in question or the manager of the petrol station? If so what was the response
4984 2018-12-19 16:25:26 The FG is always optimistic with their oil price benchmark, the rest of the world especially the US is trying everything possible to fall the price, it's already $58/barrel.

FG should better prioritize non-oil revenue generation and stop being ambitious with the budget.
4985 2018-12-19 16:25:25 10 mil families rely on cheap NFA rice.  Add P2 excise tax hike on oil = higher inflation. Tuloy lang ang pahirap sa 2019, DDS.

4987 2018-12-19 16:25:17 I need an oil change lmao
4988 2018-12-19 16:25:14 i’m sitting here waiting for my oil change to be done, and this big fluffy dog comes out of nowhere, sniffs me and disappears. i miss him
4989 2018-12-19 16:25:07 boom
4990 2018-12-19 16:25:03 Unfortunately US isn't going anywhere. It's only pulling soldiers out of Turkey's way, and increasing Turkey Russian confrontation. US still occupies the most oil rich 3rd of Syria.
4991 2018-12-19 16:25:00 ทุกคนล้วนเคยผิดหวัง 
4992 2018-12-19 16:24:53 My phone is like 4 years old and scratched in a lot of places on the screen, and all the oil resistant coating is long gone. Figured a protector would keep my finger from sticking when sliding
4993 2018-12-19 16:24:52 It's only 19°C and it feels so cold
4994 2018-12-19 16:24:35 no more foreign wars, and regime changes.. another reason Washington despise DJT
no more war for oil in Mid East 
as we are energy independent
4995 2018-12-19 16:24:31 Way to go Gil.  Your One of our best for retaining lo info lefty votes. The tweet you quote has no mention of Saudi oil.
4996 2018-12-19 16:24:30 Two Snake oil salesmen in a room ...
4997 2018-12-19 16:24:20 oil
4998 2018-12-19 16:24:16 I’m about to take black seed oil, a shot of acv, turmeric and honey, some tea and a shower with eucalyptus and tea tree.

5000 2018-12-19 16:24:11 If does hike + pause - dollar should fall - watch oil plays
5001 2018-12-19 16:24:08 I hear you. But  Trudeau want all of Canada to own the oil as per his plan not have one province dictate to the country. I think ?
5002 2018-12-19 16:24:04 Or starve. Its been on the cards for a long time. But you did nothing about it
 Now the tories have sold of our elec, gas, oil, water, refuse, trees, sewage,(yea even your human waste has been monitised) education n everything you can think of. Even your data,your texts, calls
5003 2018-12-19 16:23:59 And get ready to go to iran so the Saudis can take over those oil fields too...
5004 2018-12-19 16:23:55 Oil delivery often has a SMALLEST ORDER amount. In the 80s, we ordered 45gal at a time (not today) and you could top it up with 5gal Diesel til we got a truck to come by.
5005 2018-12-19 16:23:51 Wrong bud. The point is to get everybody down to half oil consumption in 10 years then slow decline to very little after that.
5006 2018-12-19 16:23:42 Just warmed up some Shea butter, turned it to oil, and got righteous. Airport interview 2ma too.
5007 2018-12-19 16:23:35 Even minimum wage u can't increase to 30k while South Africa just increased theirs to 126k! What a huge difference and u still believed Nigeria is giant of Africa. An oil producing country for that matter. Shame on all of u that's leading this country.
5008 2018-12-19 16:23:25 The shelf life of gasoline is also too short. No country wants to buy tankers fukk of gasoline because they can buy oil and refine themselves. 

Besides, only 43% of oil is converted to fuel. The rest is other product. It would be expensive to have tankers of that product.
5009 2018-12-19 16:23:23 . .  no puree without oil syndrome!
5010 2018-12-19 16:23:19 How about a fetish for slapping petite oil spills under cars, you should be ashamed!
5011 2018-12-19 16:22:56 Lip oil or lip gloss ?
5012 2018-12-19 16:22:54 Apparently being sick wasn't enough for me, so I sloshed hot oil on myself making breakfast! I'm okay, just a little tingly. Best burn relief is the Cranny Crew!* See ya soon 

*Statement is not endorsed by any medical professionals and is an endearing remark to cause an "aww".
5013 2018-12-19 16:22:53 Don’t piss odd your big oil & gas daddies.
5014 2018-12-19 16:22:52 the worst thing about winters is coconut oil solidifying
5015 2018-12-19 16:22:52 US Headline inflation is on target, but may soon be dragged down by a falling #oil price
5016 2018-12-19 16:22:47 Plus the irony of this statement when most of the counter science to climate change is funded by oil companies is hilarious.
5017 2018-12-19 16:22:44 I pledge to my heart this day to always use no1 cooking oil that is cholesterol free to enhance good health for my whole family #Mamador oil
5018 2018-12-19 16:22:41 With oil prices crashing don’t know if I would be investing in Texas. Just sayin. Complete housing meltdowns have happened there before.

5020 2018-12-19 16:22:34 [Eric Hippeau just now: if data is the new oil, consortiums like Facebook-Google-Netflix are the new OPEC cartel.] I’m not in the best mood, so Let me extend that: they’re running the same kind of thing as a paedophile ring.
5021 2018-12-19 16:22:33 what was your earnings in 2013 and now? when it comes to oil everybody is a global economist
5022 2018-12-19 16:22:31 A lovely RAC man came. Took one look at it and was like "there is nothing wrong with it, it's safe to drive, just needs an oil change" 

OMFG. Fuming.

But he was lovely and took me and the car to the garage, and spoke to the garage and dropped me of at a tube station
5023 2018-12-19 16:22:24 @Castrol_India Sir How to check your Bike oil is Original and duplicate?

5028 2018-12-19 16:22:11 BNY Mellon Trust to boost cash reserves for several oil trusts
5029 2018-12-19 16:22:08 You and that gentleman are very correct, Canada has one of the best environmental impact records in the world for extraction and refining of oil. Now think of all the pollution being made taking that oil to market with no pipeline.
5030 2018-12-19 16:22:06 Haha this is like oil men’s club! Hardly a shelter for the abused...
5031 2018-12-19 16:21:58 At the dealership waiting for my oil change and all the older adults are on their phones and I’m intently watching the price is right. I don’t think this is how it’s supposed to be.
5032 2018-12-19 16:21:50 I am 4,000 miles overdue for an oil change and every place I’ve called is booked until the end of next week  who let me have a car?

5036 2018-12-19 16:21:33 The politicians in Quebec have for the most part been bought and paid for by various anti- Western Canadian Oil groups, unfortunately those are the voices we hear
5037 2018-12-19 16:21:23 Goldman sacks telling clients yesterday to invest in oil was interesting. Investing in the drop?
5038 2018-12-19 16:21:15 Historic Syria has become rubble. It is the will of Europe and the US that Islam fights. If local people fight each other and become political unrest, Europe and the US come on at any time and steal oil.
5039 2018-12-19 16:21:09 More oil = more cash  great work UKOG and the team
5040 2018-12-19 16:21:01 I’m with you Mark, @JustinTrudeau isn’t any better, as an Albertan and long time Saudi critique I believe we should have banned Saudi oil long ago.But my point is we have to decide what Canadian values are (What’s right or What’s profitable) and stick to it even when it’s hard.
5041 2018-12-19 16:20:54 And just now on #CNBC, Silicon-Valley, PE Veteran says, "... #Facebook CANNOT be trusted with your Data." and other guest says, "Data is the new Oil" - meaning exploration, drilling, storage and sale. Wowser $FB
5042 2018-12-19 16:20:49 I ate too much seaweed that is greased with olive oil now my mouth feels oily af I taste olive oil. Fatsss
5043 2018-12-19 16:20:41 If @TomPerez and the @DNC truly cared about progressive values, they would divest the party from Dems who haven’t divested from Big Oil.
5044 2018-12-19 16:20:30 Trump didn't pull out of the arms deal because he didn't want Putin to have it. We also are a competitor to Russia with oil. He also arm Syrian rebels to fight Russian soldiers you're a fake news
5045 2018-12-19 16:20:11 Imagine being Native American. Your people were killed, poisoned and their land was stolen and you were pushed to reservations. Then the government wants to run oil pipes through your sacred grounds. 

And your grandson is on twitter saying talking about white privilege is racist
5046 2018-12-19 16:20:01 lemme tell y'all about @SajeWellness' moon cycle oil. omg i wish i knew about this long ago
5047 2018-12-19 16:19:51 They also use less oil so I did have like 1/4 a cup and drained the potatoes on paper towels afterwards,
5048 2018-12-19 16:19:50 I am at loss as to why we keep projecting oil production at 2.3mbpd when we haven't notched 2mbpd in a long while. Going forward, I think we should be more realistic with our figures and plan properly.
5049 2018-12-19 16:19:46 It is really naff watching your shares go down.
But isn't it great to watch them rise again.

5054 2018-12-19 16:19:21 During 7 years of war in #Syria, #Iran brought hundreds of tons of food supply, weapons, missiles, medicine, oil and thousands of men: never througfh al-Hasaka or Deir-Ezzour.

FYI and for those obsessed, #Iran and #Hezbollah have a base in al-Hasaka with the knowledge of #Kurds.

5073 2018-12-19 16:17:17 Try getting the oil warm enough so it flows easily, move it around & see if that works, try & keep it away from the bottoms though, if the air bubble gets down into the wick you won’t be able to hit it at all.

5083 2018-12-19 16:16:28 Totally agree! Because oil is totally sustainable and renewable with vast quantities and has no lasting impact on the environment. Oil stores will never be depleted and render a pipeline useless! Because we have been farming oil forever and nothing has changed for the worse?!

5088 2018-12-19 16:15:53 "salad oil."
5089 2018-12-19 16:15:41 The strategy is to choke off growth of the oil sands through limiting pipeline capacity. I would say next step is the carbon tax.  Move off cheap natural gas and condensate. The phase out of the oilsands.  On a product with relatively low margins. Just a couple of nudges.
5090 2018-12-19 16:15:37 It took 4 years to bring Oil companies out of debt by charging higher taxes. And recently PSU banks are getting stabilized. Again same carnage will happen.

5096 2018-12-19 16:14:48 Fair questions. I’ve been using $250 for this value for the year 2015 to find megascale costs knowing that mere existence of megascale will distort the price. There’s also a cost of securing access to materials a la Carter Doctrine for oil/gas.
5097 2018-12-19 16:14:40 Yeah use witches hazel every night before bed or after you shower. Also use coconut oil
5098 2018-12-19 16:14:38 When U.S. leaves Syrian Army is in a race against the Turkish invasion. Needs immediately secure Raqqa dam, oil wells and isolate ISIS.
5099 2018-12-19 16:14:34 Who is David and Goliath, what are the impact of their history. You can equally ask British Fulani to return all the land they collected from indigenous people which you the colonialists stole and renamed Nigeria only to loot Biafra oil through kill, steal and destroy @UN #UNSC
5100 2018-12-19 16:14:34 Im not saying thats what I think,  I am saying they will use that language as justification... main reason is oil is imploding so the inflation narrative is a tough one to sell right now
5101 2018-12-19 16:14:30 Bull shit... trust me ! Imagine indomie made with red palm oil

5104 2018-12-19 16:14:29 @ShereenBhan
Chollae Bhaturae + Chana Bhaturae should be nicely cooked with flavour.
There should be less oil in Bhaturae. 
This can be done by practice.
They should serve in Steel Plates.

5105 2018-12-19 16:14:21 if the guys at @GoldmanSachs actually had brains ...

they'd get Saudis to buy 5.0% of $GS at 8.0x P/E and get the damn Malays off their backs

Malaysia depends on Saudi oil and part of the Muslim sphere of influence

5108 2018-12-19 16:13:50 Nobody can get their oil to market to sell, so how are they going to make loan payments? This is like handing a drowning man a credit card and telling him to buy a boat if he survives. Ottawa is out of touch and completely tone deaf.
5109 2018-12-19 16:13:28 If oil companies can "DO IT"...
5110 2018-12-19 16:13:27 Please turn off the mainstream news. "Hands Up, Don't Shoot," never happened. Neither did "Russia Collusion," or "Peak Oil." "Global Warming" was wildly exaggerated, hence the name change to "Climate Change." You are watching a movie. It is not real.
5111 2018-12-19 16:13:17 « Iraq Min: Seeking To Boost Oil Output From Majnoon Field » cette nouvelle va t’elle fondamentalement changer la donne ?

5113 2018-12-19 16:13:16 I have a great idea for Christmas presents. CBD oil, lip balm, and Beard wax. The benefits are amazing. Prices on photos.
5114 2018-12-19 16:13:08 Omg seriously. It's mindboggling how CA touts itself as being forward thinking on environmental issues, yet most of the state has awful mass transit options & it's nearly impossible to not pass oil extraction wells when leaving LAX.

5118 2018-12-19 16:12:57 Were you equally angry when the government gave nearly $4bn in actual subsidies to Bombardier or is your anger exclusively reserved for when gvmt helps the subset of Canadians that work on getting oil out of the ground rather than those in industries that merely help to burn it?
5119 2018-12-19 16:12:54 Black Seed oil and ACV saved me
5120 2018-12-19 16:12:52 No way. That's absolutely wrong.
Ever heard of ancient Olive oil ?
5121 2018-12-19 16:12:30 The Kurdish partner forces are now running to make a deal with Assad essentially preparing the ground to give the strategic, oil rich, breadbasket of #Syria to #Iran
5122 2018-12-19 16:12:24 Oh for Christ's sake, you know goddamn well open Secrets lumps all the people who work for an oil company under that company's name. Oil and gas are huge Employers in Texas.
5123 2018-12-19 16:12:19 They will never reduce their oil imports even if they have adequate nuclear energy as a back up . On the other hand they will increase their strategic oil reserves and be prepared for any contingencies
5124 2018-12-19 16:12:17 You checking the same stock market I am?  Worst December in 40 years, oil crashing 30 a barrel?

I do have a 401k, its a crap alternative to a Pension.  Maybe i'll have 25% of what I would have had with a pension someday if the market doesn't crash when its time to retire, woohoo
5125 2018-12-19 16:12:12 Man if these folks dont hurry up wit this oil change wtf
5126 2018-12-19 16:12:12 Same happened to me while on contract with Shell. My understanding on auto delivery is that you should never have it happen and they owed you a tank of oil if they did. They said no and showed up many hours later! GRrr
5127 2018-12-19 16:11:58 I'm not sure of the exact "process", but I know this isn't right !   Our Politicians are working for the Banks, Oil and Gas companies.  @OilGasCanada has too much influence in our politics... and now the consequences are DEADLY
5128 2018-12-19 16:11:58 Would you mind putting up the price of crude oil/ barrel in 2013-14  before elections and the subsequent year prices of 2014- 2018.

5131 2018-12-19 16:11:51 So much  for Data being the next Oil!
5132 2018-12-19 16:11:50 #Kurds in Syria, STOP fighting ISIS immediately this was never your fight. Thousands of Kurds lost to ISIS while Erdogan, America's loyal & NATO ally fed them, bought oil from them, & healed their wounded.

Protect your territory, oil fields, pipelines, dams. Be ready for war.
5133 2018-12-19 16:11:47 This should be left to professionals. This is clearly an amateur! Like seriously, where’s the oil?! Where’s the glitter?! Fucking hell!!!
5134 2018-12-19 16:11:43 @sidlal For Engine Oil. Why company charges us 2.5 litres oil price. Labour just put only 2.25 litres on oil tank.
5135 2018-12-19 16:11:35 Yes, exactly. Our gains will be lost. There will be new gains for IS and for Tehran.  By giving up the oil fields we now hold in Syria, we will undercut our own sanctions. Kerry's advice to Zarif to be patient and wait Trump out will have proven correct.
5136 2018-12-19 16:11:35 The same brilliant minds that concentrated their efforts on the oil economy that is about to blow up? It does not take a genius to know that oil operates on the whim of the Saudis and Russians.
5137 2018-12-19 16:11:35 This is not tenable because crude oil lifting is not done by NNPC but by nominated marketers. The whole idea behind it is to continue the lies which was blown open by the NASS. The subsidy was hidden and not appropriated. You need a lot of lies to hide earlier lies
5138 2018-12-19 16:11:33 Trump has to earn the bribe he gets from Putin as a part of his 19% interest in Rosneft Oil. His next move is to unilaterally attempt to remove sanctions from Russia. Mueller please hurry up and do your job.

5140 2018-12-19 16:11:17 Smooth, like oil
5141 2018-12-19 16:11:04 And we said, what’s the worst thing they could do? And that would be sweeping down and deciding to take over all the oil fields. So we decided that if that’s the worst-case scenario, then make sure that we plan to handle the worst-case scenario.

5147 2018-12-19 16:10:05 The underlying presumption of Alberta secession is that post-secession, Alberta owns the oil and Canada does not. But why would that be true?

5159 2018-12-19 16:09:09 Yes, agreed. And unfortunately, “citeable precedent” in our industry is often inextricably intertwined with snake oil salesmanship of the latest fad. That’s why the emphasis needs to be on structured critical thinking, not on embracing anecdotes of alleged wild success.
5160 2018-12-19 16:09:08 Yeah, that seems most likely -- which spares me dribbling sewing machine oil all over my bathroom door in the name of research!

5163 2018-12-19 16:08:50 Yeah but can we trust these test for thc are accurate? I had a friend take a 50mg dose of lp oil. He went to hospital cause it was his first time and he got paranoid. They tested his blood and said he had over 300mg thc in his bloodstream. I take the same oil def wasn’t 300mg lol
5164 2018-12-19 16:08:49 No your right we should jock Bush and Clinton’s that started huge wars for their rich buddies and got hundreds of thousands killed. They sell weapons and oil heaven forbid someone sells hotels. They crashed the economy and stole trillions you guys are brainwashed.

5171 2018-12-19 16:08:10 So do not export any oil .
5172 2018-12-19 16:08:08 Syria has no oil.

5175 2018-12-19 16:07:57 1. Only Turkey can do that as it has the money and willingness to spend it
2. Not possible without lighting the entire region on fire and collapsing Oil Exports.
3. Not currently possible and US lacks the street cred to pull off anyway after leveling 1/3 of Syria fighting ISIS
5176 2018-12-19 16:07:56 China's Nuclear power plants have grown multifold in capacity.. Dip in oil requirements in future??

5180 2018-12-19 16:07:37 Complicating matters, Syria doesn't have much oil but what it does is located in that NE corner.
5181 2018-12-19 16:07:33 No we don't! We need to survive as a species. If you lived in a dome with a limited amount of oxygen, would you light a fire? Oil has to be over!
5182 2018-12-19 16:07:32 Nonsense. If you’re a racist, you are—by definition—opposed to individual rights. The two are as incompatible as oil and water.

5190 2018-12-19 16:07:10 Does @SecretaryCarson agree with @EPA that it’s “inappropriate” as a matter of law to reduce brain poisons lead (& mercury, cancer-causing arsenic & benzene & dozens of air toxins) from power plants that burn coal & oil?

5195 2018-12-19 16:06:32 Fair but it is how every towering goalie, and even most of the non-towering guys, play.
5196 2018-12-19 16:06:26 The opposite is true, as usual. Do you still have that larger than life golf oil portrait the foundation bought for you?
5197 2018-12-19 16:06:02 Submitting a budget in December for 2019, assuming an oil price of $60 when current prices are mid $50’s, forecasting oil production at 2.3m a day when this years average is 1.9m tells us these folk in government are taking us nowhere.
5198 2018-12-19 16:06:01 Not for the oil then

5200 2018-12-19 16:05:53 Kurt have you looked at Talbot's style 2016-17 vs later? Seems to me they changed his butterfly style to post-stacking after the playoff run and he's never been the same since.

5202 2018-12-19 16:05:44 What a loon ! Quebec takes our money and buys their oil from other (less environmentally sound ,less concerned with human rights) countries ! Calling it grandstanding only proves what a pompous hypocrite you and many Quebecers are !
5203 2018-12-19 16:05:40 cleaning oily skin
Use an oil free foaming cleanser to wash face with, just use warm water to wash off cleanser. After use a toner, these products take away some oils to make your skin look cleaner.

If toner irritates or increases oiliness to skin stop using the product.
5204 2018-12-19 16:05:28 Bought MCX crude oil @ 3380.
This is positional trade.
Will wait for some days..
SL and target are open and adjustable.
5205 2018-12-19 16:05:23 And next they're going to add fuel to the fire by moving oil by rail taking up valuable rail capacity that Ag needs to move their products.  Hang on, our troubles aren't over yet.

5207 2018-12-19 16:05:21 @McVities hi! Is your palm oil sustainably sourced?
5208 2018-12-19 16:05:21 I think you would be desperate if one of your family members are murdered or jihad moves into your neighborhood.

5214 2018-12-19 16:04:59 The oil patch has been a drain on the canadian economy for years now and has been getting worse, with billion dollar companies at the trough for more taxpayer cash to fill their bonus envelopes, while people are losing their jobs across our nation! 
#OilMoneyScam
5215 2018-12-19 16:04:56 This week in #Alberta :
-Federal Government spends 1.6 billion in tax payer dollars to subsidize a dying fossil fuel industry. Global oil economy is broken and Alberta squandered the billions of dollars we could have saved in the past, yet we refuse to diversify.
5216 2018-12-19 16:04:55 Squeak labeled a jar of coconut oil as “Wes” and I cannot stop. It’s the funniest thing since Botato #RIPBotato

5218 2018-12-19 16:04:39 You don't need any oil for yours, JJ--it is always in a constant state of sopping wetness anyway.
5219 2018-12-19 16:04:38 @mikiebarb Continuing to enjoy The Daily ea morning tho I’m struck by the recent ads from Johnson & Johnson, Facebook, & esp Shell Oil.

5229 2018-12-19 16:03:55 There is zero victory in war. We lost people in every war. The Middle East will be at war for the enviable future. Oil dragged us there. Our blood saturated the Middle East and for what?
5230 2018-12-19 16:03:54 Better idea: let's get a practical all electric car for under $25k, that everyone will buy. Enough of those on the road, and we quit relying on ME oil. 

Once that happens, we walk away and let them kill each other, if that's what they want to do.

Not our problem any more.

5232 2018-12-19 16:03:47 So presidential lead action plan will include declaring it “inappropriate” as a matter of law to reduce brain poisons lead (& mercury, cancer-causing arsenic & benzene & dozens of air toxins) from power plants that burn coal & oil. 
How do you justify that disgrace, @EPAAWheeler?
5233 2018-12-19 16:03:45 wake up, turdo is ruining Alberta oil.
5234 2018-12-19 16:03:39 Pake extra ordinary olive oil karena mengurangi bahan kimia nempel diwajah. Di apotek banyak.
5235 2018-12-19 16:03:31 If the plan is to eliminate the oil industry along with all of the jobs that go with it then I must congratulate you on a job well done. Canada has never been more divided. Don't break your arm patting yourself on the back. #outoftouch
5236 2018-12-19 16:03:25 Number one I know what gender I am and for 2 I've lived and worked in the USA I worked for the largest oil rig moving company in the USA I was based out of the corporate office in Grand Junction Colorado and that being said I have lived in both countries
5237 2018-12-19 16:03:18 You're happily letting yourself get used by oil companies, dude
5238 2018-12-19 16:03:12 Noooo paige heat you up some sweet oil and drop it in there or get ya hubby to piss in a jar n put about 4 drops in your ear
5239 2018-12-19 16:03:09 Is this like packing up the snake oil wagon just ahead of the tar and feather party?
5240 2018-12-19 16:03:01 I would think that was just your #oil high of the day. #cl_f
5241 2018-12-19 16:02:55 You got a lot of replies but wanted to add mine. Yes Miralax works great, sometimes it takes a few days and sometimes it works quick. I use one teaspoon of olive oil mixed in 4 oz of orange juice, that has worked for my kids when I needed a quicker relief.
5242 2018-12-19 16:02:53 Oil is the awesome sauce which provides half the energy humanity needs to survive. Greenpeace are bastards. That’s not a hard decision.
5243 2018-12-19 16:02:50 @brianwhitman @JenniferHorn @kcampradio @am870theanswer  Brian let me help.  Oil hovering at $48 a barrel.  What is criminal the guvmint gouge gas tax RATE is 40% today (2.95 a gallon). do the numbs: 295 in Anaheim pump price  295 mimus 84 total tax = 211  Divide into 84>39.8%
5244 2018-12-19 16:02:43 If you can't handle me at my butter than you don't deserve me at my olive oil
5245 2018-12-19 16:02:33 It’s his style that I’m questioning.
5246 2018-12-19 16:02:30 Oil rocking. Put out the alert yesterday. Just took profits on $USO but still holding $UCO with members of the #ResearchCenter, up almost $1.00 already.
5247 2018-12-19 16:02:23 Nas napadac Benjamin Tatar je produzio ugovor i potvrdio vjernost Bordo klubu do 2021. godine. Sponzorisao: Green Oil d.o.o.
5248 2018-12-19 16:02:16 I taya oooo, bread and red oil? Smh
5249 2018-12-19 16:02:14 Isn't it boepd that's 50/50..with gas boe at lower value therefore less than 50% of rev?...thought boe gas was c.$44 first 6 months 2018, oil $72... nevertheless 30% on 44 is $13 and 20% on %70 Is $14... so about neutral? I was looking for that gas figure...do you have website?
5250 2018-12-19 16:02:14  it’s true. Coconut oil and a sample oil kristin gave me for dry skin. Haha im so used to like 100% humidity that being here has been awful for my skin haha. Also I’m not okay with looking dusty so....

5254 2018-12-19 16:01:58 Inshallah! Oil Money + Jose 
5255 2018-12-19 16:01:46 Reports out of Gainesville indicate Coach Mullet was at Jiffy Lube getting his oil changed when staff had to call and remind him it was signing day. According to an insider he said “it was no big deal”. #GoGators
5256 2018-12-19 16:01:43 gago hanapin mo yung oil parang kanina ang tangek mo di mo nagegets. Parang magkasama lang tayo kanina tas nakalimot ka
5257 2018-12-19 16:01:41 Oil prices have collapsed nearly 40% from the nearby highs. Never before has the Fed tightened policy into such a free-fall in crude. So why would it now? Look for the Fed to take a pass tomorrow. This is not about political pressure, but rather receding inflation expectations
5258 2018-12-19 16:01:40 Let's read about small British business kicking butt in the Middle Kingdom. 
Oh. 
UK exports: cars, oil and pharmaceuticals. 
Ending the Single Market and JiT is a crotch-kick to two of those, but I'm sure your local essex oil refinery is looking forward to it.
5259 2018-12-19 16:01:34 November Housing Starts jump. Oil prices decline, gas prices fall. Housing inventories increase.
5260 2018-12-19 16:01:30 Because converting our oil to gasoline and distributing it throughout the country is really expensive. If I’m wrong someone please correct me... If not, funny how a CTax reduces our standard of living but expensive energy independence does not.
5261 2018-12-19 16:01:29 Essential Oil is the only perfume I vouch for. All that acetone shit tastes like ass when y’all reach the bedroom and really that’s what matters most.
5262 2018-12-19 16:01:21 rub you down with the oil. to get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia 
5263 2018-12-19 16:01:15 As these major tech companies have proven, data is the gold/tulips/oil of the 21st century. We must protect people’s privacy and educate them of their rights (when we get them).
5264 2018-12-19 16:01:09 That remains to be seen. It is speculation but the fact remains is that Alberta is spending almost a billion dollars on trains and rail cars to ship Alberta oil due to the bottle neck. The fact remains Energy East would make Canada energy independent. So your point is mute
5265 2018-12-19 16:00:59 If US wants oil up, it will have to take usd down
5266 2018-12-19 16:00:59 Another pause, wondering if bolts really become silent if oiled, as is so common in fiction. Shall I go find oil and try it? The bathroom door has a rattling bolt. Or will this result in a general mess and the conclusion that bolts are going to rattle regardless?
5267 2018-12-19 16:00:45 Lol damn my son offering to give me a free oil change Saturday  don’t need one but it’s free
5268 2018-12-19 16:00:39 Yea and the Bushes were not bizz people in oil and weapons. Not a peep from the globalists msm but ohhh wow hotels and real estate how could we let such a horrible man into office. Did you ever think about that. They sure liked trump until he stood up for our borders.

5273 2018-12-19 16:00:22 gasemua muka bisa cocok sm cleansing oil.. mungkin kamu gt
5274 2018-12-19 16:00:16 Oi..Adrian ...this could get hotter than your pickled onions soon 

#ukog @Adrianwfire
5275 2018-12-19 16:00:06 And JTs idea to buy more rail cars will only backlog an already busy rail system...how will the west get grain to ports if the rails are full of oil?
5276 2018-12-19 15:59:55 #Syria- Take a moment to celebrate the US's withdrawal. Remember turkish invasion over North East #Syria is imminent, the army needs to cross the euphrates & take the oil fields, Turkey must be made aware of the consequences of any harm comes to the Syrian army in Qamishli.
5277 2018-12-19 15:59:49 How is Tammy's perfectly accurate & realistic response an indicator that she hates Alberta oil?
Thinking the @Alberta_UCP up will ruin this province and set us back decades does not equal hating Alberta oil.
5278 2018-12-19 15:59:48 Oil prices at the current level will ravage Saudi economy
5279 2018-12-19 15:59:45 I just smelt the most glorious perfume oil! Does anyone sell Sunnamusk perfume oils in Lagos??
5280 2018-12-19 15:59:16 Somehow, we have made people who feel pain experts on whatever it is that causes that pain.
Unemployed pipeline/oil patch workers are made out to be experts on oil production/transport. 
Parents of children killed in school shootings are made to be experts on mass shootings.
5281 2018-12-19 15:59:09 Let it go Graham, Americans are sick of unseen wars where our young are wasted on protecting oil companies resources and spreading the global bank...
5282 2018-12-19 15:59:08 Shut down oil production. It’s not difficult.
5283 2018-12-19 15:59:02 CRUDE OIL is fighting back,  WTI has returned to round 48.00 USD per barrel, after touching 46.30 USD Yesterday; the "motives" remain unknown.
5284 2018-12-19 15:58:59 More like protecting other oil producers from another market entry, i.e. Alberta Oil.
Considering that President Trump wants lower oil prices, you would think he would welcome Alberta's entry into the global market.
5285 2018-12-19 15:58:58 No the US is more than just ok, their economy is on fire. Canada-quality of jobs matter. TruDope incurrs massive debt that helps short term but fails to allow business to establish the underlying true economic engine. TruDope has killed Oil and is now putting out a welfare fund.
5286 2018-12-19 15:58:58 Sana oil
5287 2018-12-19 15:58:48 Out.  Get our troops out of the Middle East, all of it.  We’ve lost enough young people to advance the oil agenda.  Bring em all home.

5292 2018-12-19 15:58:38 The Middle East has little to offer America except dirty oil money to support our military industrial complex. We can do better for Americans.
5293 2018-12-19 15:58:28 Cannabis oil
5294 2018-12-19 15:58:26 That's not my entire argument at all. Show me stats in reverse, I'd love to see them. They all include the cost of refining other oil byproducts so are generally utter rubbish.
5295 2018-12-19 15:58:21 SAA will attack Tabqa and oil fields.
5296 2018-12-19 15:58:16 All these oil field guys are dumb as shit.
5297 2018-12-19 15:58:10 Kinda want chic fi la.. ima get that & eat it while i get my oil changed.
5298 2018-12-19 15:58:04 Some elevators do oil content on deliveries. No grade but might be so called premium paid on results. Not sure tho.
5299 2018-12-19 15:58:04 10-15 mins but if there is oil then 20+ and it includes conditioning too.
5300 2018-12-19 15:58:03 Price of oil dropping- Putin needs to have those pipelines flowing...
5301 2018-12-19 15:58:00 The oil has probably congealed into a rubbery blob and is complaining at being woken up.
5302 2018-12-19 15:58:00 $MJNA nnounced the launch of its latest pet product, Phyto Animal Health Vitality 3G Oral Concentrate.

This full-spectrum oil contains 510 mg of #CBD abundant in terpenes, chlorophyll, essential fatty acids, and additional natural cannabinoid compounds found in hemp.
5303 2018-12-19 15:57:59 The planets running out of oil n we’re all going to die
5304 2018-12-19 15:57:57 อยากเห็นอีกสองวงนะ เชียร์อยู่ นอนกัน ฝันดีค่า
5305 2018-12-19 15:57:55 Dead flowers drape me
Gloomy skies color
Caramel skin gray

Giggles convert to
Wet eyes of sorrow
Disgusted in my own skin

Reflections of poor judgements
Clog s my mind like oil to a pore
Joy stolen by a 

Culprit once still loved
Drinking my bodies liquid
I drank myself away
5306 2018-12-19 15:57:54 Stop funding corporate welfare to Walmart and Oil Companies then the money would be there.
5307 2018-12-19 15:57:39 can’t believe shelbey was comfortable enough telling me she been needing a oil change since may.
5308 2018-12-19 15:57:29 Any info about Nokia 8 Sirocco? Seems like burning midnight oil was not enough :(
5309 2018-12-19 15:57:24 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
5310 2018-12-19 15:57:16 So are we leaving, or will you continue to use our mercenaries—I mean military to fight oil wars that should have been over 20+ years ago?
5311 2018-12-19 15:57:16 We should send JRM back to the haunted oil painting he escaped from
5312 2018-12-19 15:57:15 Bring some snow for me honorable
5313 2018-12-19 15:57:11 I need an oil change 
5314 2018-12-19 15:57:04 เงินไม่เหลือ เงินที่วงพี่หาได้ก็คงแบ่งหลายทาง เอาใจช่วยให้รอดภสวะวิกฤตินี้ไปให้ได้แม้อนาคตวงเราจะออกหมดแล้ว /นอนได้ บะบายย
5315 2018-12-19 15:56:58 Nationalized a pipeline after cancelling an approved pipeline and then changing the regulations to stop another to ship Canadian oil east...... And then insult to injury upping EI to cover for their incompetence...

Turdeau and the Liberals are both incompetent and pathetic. Sad.
5316 2018-12-19 15:56:51 How to be #lowkeypetty using the oil my boyfriend doesn’t like in my diffuser today because he didn’t get up with the baby last night like he said he would. #essentialoils #petty #tiredmomma
5317 2018-12-19 15:56:46 The future of Nigeria is beyond oil. #ASBON @BicFarms @DOnafowora #NationalBusinessAwards2018
5318 2018-12-19 15:56:41 Disappointed that @coopukfood‘s own brand has no sunflower/vegetable spreads that don’t contain palm oil - hope you’re working to divest!
5319 2018-12-19 15:56:39 Takes the second most amount of money from the oil and gass industries in Congress. Also, doesn't want to be thought of as a Progressive. A singularly bad candidate at a time when the first priority in the country should be a Green New Deal.
5320 2018-12-19 15:56:37 The East doesn’t import the oil... Irving Oil does..
5321 2018-12-19 15:56:35 Bush Sr is a demonstration of American elite and their background. 

Daddy [Prescott Bush] - Skull and Bones - Masonry - CIA - Oil Business - 41th US President
5322 2018-12-19 15:56:27 hold up, did my brows just grow overnight  YALL NEED TO COP THIS JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL YO !
5323 2018-12-19 15:56:21 Fake Christian. Raised a liar. Support a criminal who harms children! Snake oil salesman.
5324 2018-12-19 15:55:58 In my opinion, most edge controls are  — olive oil eco styler gel is the wave.
5325 2018-12-19 15:55:57 Chikkodi dist Belgaum state Karnataka Indian oil petrol bunk , today I filled petrol to my bike !! Hope you stay in India only .
5326 2018-12-19 15:55:55 He will not be getting any wall either, unless Mexico pays for it, after all didn't he hired undocumented people to clean his bedminster rooms. When will you people realize that Trump is a snake oil conman
5327 2018-12-19 15:55:53 We care, we fight, we scream, we write.  The sooner we get trump, his administration, his oil/gas/coal/welfare ranchers and assorted cronies out, the better it will be.  But he has caused so much damage to all the departments in the government.
5328 2018-12-19 15:55:52 Yg oil 40an kalo ga salah
5329 2018-12-19 15:55:47 Except Genie Energy in the oil rich occupied Golan I bet
5330 2018-12-19 15:55:45 If you worked like @Canadianeh79 you wouldn't have oil stains 
5331 2018-12-19 15:55:44

5332 2018-12-19 15:55:40 Jgn di scrub yg penting, tar makin menjadi jadi. Kalo mau di scrub pke yg mild aja atau pake chemical toner. Coba pake obat totol jerawat kaya oxy10, acnol. Sekalian di cek jg youtube liah yoo ttg acne, dia jg ngejelasin produk oil *termasuk rosehip* buat jerawat
5333 2018-12-19 15:55:35 Canada must transform it's oil sector, to domestic use. It's the only way to keep it going and help the economy for the long run.
5334 2018-12-19 15:55:34 OTD 1973: Arab summit conference adopts open and secret resolutions on the use of the oil weapon. Embargo extended to Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa.
5335 2018-12-19 15:55:33 Oh, sorry I'm used to most people that oppose Scheer opposing the oil sector. They seem to go hand in hand lately.
5336 2018-12-19 15:55:33 I use jojoba oil but I also recommend doing a patch test on your arm beforehand. I used to dilute Tea Tree with it when I was stretching and because that skin is so susceptible to infection, I developed a HORRIBLE allergy. Take care of yourself and I hope you enjoy your mods! 
5337 2018-12-19 15:55:29 aur ye oil nikalen ge kese?
5338 2018-12-19 15:55:29 Plenty oil Dey your head ..
5339 2018-12-19 15:55:20 @WhiteHouse @TheJusticeDept @DeptofDefense @GOP @DNC IMO the neocon Warmongers from WPost,NYT,CNN ,NBC,ABC to Kristol,Brooks  & previous Institute of Peace that pushed arming only sunni jihad & get Oil should be indicted for Blood crimes,what a mess they leave behind, traitors !
5340 2018-12-19 15:55:18 หนูว่าเรื่องเงินอ่ะ เรื่องใหญ่สำหรับทีเอสเลยตอนนี้ แต่ถ้าลองเสี่ยงลงทุนดันน้องทั้งสองวงให้สุด มันต้องได้อะไรกลับมาบ้างแหละ หนูว่านะ ดีกว่าดองอ่ะ ใช่ว่าเด็กจะไม่มีความสามารถ แฟนรอจนหายหมดแล้ว

5342 2018-12-19 15:54:57 If Sharad Pawar declares maximum slab of GST will be 5% then he will win. But the main skill how would Rahul manage govt earnings and spendings without begging for loan in international market.
UPA2 maintained low prices of oil by taking loan. (Under name Bonds)
5343 2018-12-19 15:54:55 I've always laughed at the duality of oil protesters; after Lac Magantic it was all "we need pipelines for oil, trains are dangerous!" Soon as they go to put in a pipeline. "No pipelines! Think of the water!" Yous can't have your pussycake n eat it too, hippies.
5344 2018-12-19 15:54:51 Hmm....wonder if the oil crash has anything to do with this. They are useless when it comes to nuanced diplomatic engagement.
5345 2018-12-19 15:54:42 $FANG up $6 now on the 2019 plan.  Other #permians take note. Promise more with less, promise less if oil drops more. This is your mantra. #OOTT
5346 2018-12-19 15:54:36 Mine took like a full year to heal. Tea tree oil is good if you get a keloid
5347 2018-12-19 15:54:25 I will never understand men who don't moisturize.

5348 2018-12-19 15:54:18 I know weed is self care for some people too I don’t judge just don’t judge me either?? plus 35$ for 8 different big ass oils for my hair oil mix (some of which I could also use for cooking if I did that lmaoo) isn’t even bad?? took me so long to find out what hair likes too damn
5349 2018-12-19 15:54:17 oil +4%
5350 2018-12-19 15:54:16 I see Willie Taggert out here still selling that snake oil to these kids. If you’re committed to #FSU I feel bad for you son. I got 99 problems but being lied to ain’t one. #ChompChomp #BigWillieMiss #SnakeOil #GoGators #NationalSigningDay
5351 2018-12-19 15:54:09 Tell me about the oil paintings of you.....
5352 2018-12-19 15:54:08 You and @TheRealDBell_  will be in B1G10 championship game at Lucas Oil next year on God
5353 2018-12-19 15:54:05 While calling out Germany on its use of Russian oil.
5354 2018-12-19 15:53:59 Oil is sexy
5355 2018-12-19 15:53:57 Both @PressSec and @GovMikeHuckabee are smug, self-righteous pseudo-Christians.  The faction they belong to, the White Evangelicals has a history of duping people into handing money over in the hopes of BUYING salvation.
They are con artists much like erstwhile Snake Oil Salesmen
5356 2018-12-19 15:53:56 "40% oil imports pass through the sea".. How wud arctic oil n gas discoveries change that for China? They r already turning dat way wid Russia wid new refineries
5357 2018-12-19 15:53:53 There is no grading for oil is there yet?
5358 2018-12-19 15:53:41 "Stupid people"  think the old timer better move back to Oil Drum Lane
5359 2018-12-19 15:53:33 Or just maybe, a grifting snake oil salesman who has never been held to account is finally having his chickens come home to roost?

But hey why would you take the word of life long law enforcement officers over that of a lying narcissist who cares only for wealth and himself? 
5360 2018-12-19 15:53:28 I hate going to the dealership and they try to finesse meleave me alone and change my damn oil, chuckleheads. Next time Lip is doing this

5368 2018-12-19 15:53:02 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: US stocks rise before Federal Reserve meeting; oil rebounds
5369 2018-12-19 15:53:01 Gulf states oil money influence politicians, UN & EU bureaucrats, and social media giants. That money never seem to sway the people will. 

“WE THE PEOPLE” moment in Belgium!

God bless.
5370 2018-12-19 15:52:57 If oil corporations paid their fair share of taxes and royalties, Alberta and Canada would be doing better, too. Alberta would also be doing better if their tax rates in general weren’t so low.
5371 2018-12-19 15:52:54 Interpretation: The Oil and Gas was not found by the US thugs .
5372 2018-12-19 15:52:54 朝鮮征伐、日本側は戦国武将オールスターズで、対峙する朝鮮、明の面々もキャラ立ちすぎで、面白くならないわけがないんですけど、国際感情に配慮して商業ではほぼ無理な媒体ですからね……
5373 2018-12-19 15:52:52 Along with time and the right lubricant, you should be able to avoid that irritation. Wait 2-3 months, then take a hot shower. Try tapers (they work the best for between jewelry), then jojoba oil for lubrication. (You can also use Neosporin for the current irritation!) Good luck!

5375 2018-12-19 15:52:36 Lying scum.  You paid bribes and bought oil paintings of yourself with donations to charity.  Never gave a dime.  Your “foundation” closed for ‘persistently illegal conduct" and "willful self-dealing."
5376 2018-12-19 15:52:33 this is my skin type, i have combination skin and i struggle to find something hydrating but not too much for my t-zone and honestly these two ingredients are the best! and jojoba oil works for all skin types normally! but everyone reacts differently soi hope it’ll work for u 
5377 2018-12-19 15:52:32 Oil market must have the Federal Reserve phones tapped... acting like it knows something.

5379 2018-12-19 15:52:24 My hairs get oily too fast that u can fry chicken with that oil.
5380 2018-12-19 15:52:01 @JustinTrudeau your plan for the oil and gas industry is to throw our tax dollars at it but to leave the underlying problems in place. Quit interfering in the markets. Give the companies enough room to grow and expand in a reasonable way and the markets will sort themselves out.
5381 2018-12-19 15:51:59 My booty is dehydrated. I need a rub down with some coconut oil

5384 2018-12-19 15:51:46 I feel like truffle fries would be a better analogy than truffle steak (and also sometimes you're getting truffle oil which is just marketing BS).

Good explainer though!

5390 2018-12-19 15:51:23 Typical politician, selling us nothing but snake oil.
5391 2018-12-19 15:51:18 Yeah I have read the Irving’s press release of continued support for Saudi oil.  It is a chicken or egg argument. If there was a pipeline perhaps Irving’s would build a Coker.  If nothing else it opens Alberta oil to export markets.  Hard to know cause we don’t have that chance.
5392 2018-12-19 15:51:16 *Raises hand*
Actually, I would prefer it if the oil corporations themselves paid for it. Many are actually still doing fine - because they built  their own rail, infrastructure, etc. The ones that didn’t are the ones suffering

Some might call this the “free market” 
5393 2018-12-19 15:51:13 In Odessa, oil drills for you!
5394 2018-12-19 15:51:06 There are prices to pay for the very rich life that the oil industry has afforded many of its players. That now will include all of us. So no whining: pay the carbon tax, pay for the clean-up, reduce your use of fossil fuels: this is the bill for the good times!
5395 2018-12-19 15:51:06 raspberry cleansing oil
5396 2018-12-19 15:51:02 So oil prices will keep falling. Pump and pay interest, rinse, repeat.

5399 2018-12-19 15:50:55 Don't know any publically traded oil companies that have public executions or stone women or chop up journalists. But let's focus on birds haha!

5403 2018-12-19 15:50:42 The world will need natural resources for decades to come while we transition to alternates. Oil will be extracted and processed some where so why not here where it's done with less environmental impact than other countries would and thus employing thousands.
5404 2018-12-19 15:50:41 you know that they care more about oil and gas than conservation, the first two make them rich materially and the second can only make them rich in diversity
5405 2018-12-19 15:50:39 Looks like he is getting ready for a beating. OIL PRICE CRASH

5408 2018-12-19 15:50:16 I must be too stressed because I had a dream where I tried to buy cigarettes on a train.

The kicker? The guy would only sell me a complicated partially assembled vape rig that I had to pack away in a closet because it was illegal, it cost $550,  and he forgot to give me the oil.

5412 2018-12-19 15:50:11 It's hemp oil that you vape. Normally not a vape dude myself but CBD is a known anti-inflammatory that can calm your britches without the THC (which is still illegal in most states)

My grandmother swears by it for pain, and a friend of mine swears by it for anxiety.

5423 2018-12-19 15:49:29 They had a report this morning about people trying to vape this stuff .... kiddies stick to the erbs and leave the CBD oils alone. It's not the same as the oil In the legal smoke shops 
5424 2018-12-19 15:49:18 Getting my oil change...finally...because last week I had to reschedule because I was hungover...and by hungover I mean I had a headache after 3 beers

5437 2018-12-19 15:47:57 I use mayo to make grilled cheese if I don't have butter. It literally just oil to cook the bread on the griddle. I don't do it often but it works pretty good. Once you get passed the fact it's mayo and it's actually just oil and other ingredients then you're fine.
5438 2018-12-19 15:47:56 @Donald_Duke is advising.  Bloomberg is ok but remember how volatile our system is. Safer to give room for contingency.  You have pressure from huge  foreign  Debts  and if oil gluts,  then more tongues will wag. Keep talking.
5439 2018-12-19 15:47:40 Oil & gas "interests" have literally savead the planet and its population from mass starvation and death for 100+ years. With that in mind the entire world population is an oil & gas "interest".
5440 2018-12-19 15:47:40 I think the blood of the virgin comes in an essential oil now.
5441 2018-12-19 15:47:40 Do you think 50-year capital investments in the highest-cost highest-carbon heavy oil on the planet is a good idea in a carbon-constrained fast-electrifying world?

5443 2018-12-19 15:47:37 Why not tell your friends in the offshore oil business to start harvesting this source of petroleum?
5444 2018-12-19 15:47:35 The dilutent is returned by truck to Fort Mac to be reintroduced.  Lighter gravity oils are introduced at Regina, Sask and Cromer, MB to further improve the grade of oil.

5446 2018-12-19 15:47:26 Specifically, what is vegetable oil? Like mazola and junk like that?
5447 2018-12-19 15:47:21 Trump was a business man, he didn't need to become #POTUS. To assume only reason to become POTUS to make money is liable slander.His hard-line stance on Russia is proof of that, sanctions,bombing Russian planes in Syria, China tariffs.Opening up US Oil exports hurts Russia & ME.

5456 2018-12-19 15:46:41 there’s also a long history of oil corps, particularly Exxon and Mobil exploiting the country and paying off the Jimenez regime, the US gov even awarded Pérez Jimenez a medal basically for letting oil corps drill all over the country
5457 2018-12-19 15:46:39 I digress, I researched oil pulling, how to properly mix it, how to use & apply it, how often, health benefits (because there weren’t any negatives), and the microbiology & pathophysiology and  of WHY it works.
5458 2018-12-19 15:46:29 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
5459 2018-12-19 15:46:09 If oil fails Canada goes down the toilet, fyi.
5460 2018-12-19 15:46:07 It’s all in how you season it. After every use, wipe it down with a paper towel soaked in oil, heat it on the stove until it starts to smoke, then turn it off and wipe out the excess. Eventually it’ll be super non-stick.

5472 2018-12-19 15:45:02 Not true.  Sorry.  Once the oil is blended, it stays blended. You are referring to the initial injection of a product at Fort Mac.  This product is removed at the Edmonton and Hardisty terminals and replaced with lighter gravity oils that stay suspended.
5473 2018-12-19 15:44:57 Oil’s slump has rippled from energy producers to the high-yield debt market. The S&P 500 energy sector fell 2.3% yesterday, dragging the broader equity gauge lower.

5476 2018-12-19 15:44:53 I do believe you are entitled to start your own company and benefit from oil extraction at any time. "The people " are the beneficiaries of royalties for all oil production. Ask the Venezuela people how they enjoy complete state control of oil production!

This  is adding up 

I really just wanted my oil changed!

5480 2018-12-19 15:44:25 Ya el big oil está en bear market debido a la desaceleración comercial, el dry Baltic index que es el índice de transporte marítimo se desplomó en 80 - 90 %,  eso debe de decir algo creo yo.
5481 2018-12-19 15:44:23 $OIH Large unusual 707K print oil services ETF $15.39 Bullish above $15.50 Bearish below $15.20
5482 2018-12-19 15:44:15 Oil prices fell to their lowest levels in over a year yesterday, continuing a precipitous decline.

West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, slid 7.3% to $46.24 a barrel, a nearly 40% decline from the roughly four-year highs reached at the start of October.
5483 2018-12-19 15:44:13 So if Can stops importing oil global emissions go down by 6.2%! Time to read the disclaimer section on the CERI site. We can be stewards by rapidly transitioning our energy/transpo sectors to renewables. Oil sands produce one of the most carbon intensive products on the planet.
5484 2018-12-19 15:44:10 Finally, now it is time to really pressure Saudi Arabia, oil prices are low and set to move lower, we do not need to buy any oil from countries that openly sponsor terrorism and practice apartheid against women. Then their is their human rights record which mirrors North Korea.
5485 2018-12-19 15:44:05 My ears hurt so bad my first trimester I was super sick too. I put organic garlic oil drops in my ears and then a cotton ball slathered with vicks vapo rub on it. Worked so nice especially at night.

5491 2018-12-19 15:43:33 at times, these numbers are well out but they do show a high % of the time the direction of eia compared to API. Both are working off oil inventories so the difference between them is really quite small.

5499 2018-12-19 15:43:13 It is the governments fault that Alberta over built its oil industry and doesn’t want to cut production to bring prices back up. #andysjustnotready

5502 2018-12-19 15:43:06 There’s no other option left for us with politicians blocking us from the east, west & Ottawa! The positives would outweigh the negatives! If we split, then the corrupt politicians of Ottawa, QC, & BC can negotiate trade with us or not...buy our oil or not! Their choice!
5503 2018-12-19 15:43:03 Well, the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) consists of now 12 oil and gas companies, mostly huge ones, who are now beginning to invest directly in actual CCS projects (not just technologies) & have committed more than $1B to the effort to start.
5504 2018-12-19 15:42:59 #EIA #oil #data: U.S. total oil products supplied last 4-week period averaged 21.2 million bpd, +4.5% vs year ago; #gasoline averaged 9.1 mln bpd, +0.6% (gasoline UP!); #distillate averaged 4.2 mln bpd, +6.5%; #jet #fuel -5.8%.

5505 2018-12-19 15:42:53 I stopped using dryer sheets awhile ago because I read how they’re terrible for the environment and full of formaldehyde which doesn’t belong on skin. I’m now using linen balls that I dab with a few drops of essential oil for fragrance and it makes my clothes feel so soft.
5506 2018-12-19 15:42:51 Hi, @IcelandFoods your Christmas pudding has got palm oil in it. Thought you were removing palm oil from all your products?
5507 2018-12-19 15:42:48 The oil funds from Turkana.  Titanium from Kwale should be deposited in a sovereign fund. Has that fund been set up. Who are the signatories?  How much has been collected to date ???
5508 2018-12-19 15:42:48 Just need to do simple math, stay with me here. KM pipeline purchase $4.7B, future TMX $7-10B, EI top ups $2B, recently announced oil/gas bailout $1.6B, Ocean Protections plan (undo Harper cuts) $1.5B.
5509 2018-12-19 15:42:44 How does one create a civil war in another country bc they wouldn't allow you to run an oil pipeline through it... then announce you "defeated" the terrorists in which you paid? I'll be damned.

Clove oil, turmeric gel, cordosyl, peppermint essential oil.
And oragel for pain relief. 
Ah, and Colgate has a page about treating gum disease if you don’t have dental insurance (wow, so American) - they advertise Periogard
5513 2018-12-19 15:42:23 @JustinTrudeau @PMcanadien @CanadianPM @CBCPolitics 1.6 Billion okay if given directly to Oil Workers to retrain in Clean Energy & clean energy operations etc -NOT ACCEPTABLE giving a Billion $$ to the Billionaires  AND WHERE is the MONEY 4 the SEARS workers/retirees?
5514 2018-12-19 15:42:20 Tubi tubi all day y antes de hacerte blower no te pongas nada en el cabello, solo lavatelo y ponte un heat protector que sea oil free.
5515 2018-12-19 15:42:04 Oddly, no one has pledged a cent to helping us to transition to renewable energy.  Alberta could just as easily become a renewable energy superpower, but the focus continues to be on squeezing all the oil we can from the oil sands.

5533 2018-12-19 15:40:59 As I was buying gasoline today I just realized after hearing a report that eventually oil will become scarce, that Russia is going to win. They have by far the greatest land mass and the greatest oil resources.
5534 2018-12-19 15:40:57 God is not aiming at you when He blesses you, He is aiming at generations after you. He blessed Samuel but His target was David. Your oil knows your head, it will always flow when the horn gets to you.

5538 2018-12-19 15:40:37 End the provocations against Iran! They do not seek war. They are trying to compete in international business and oil industry. Controlling their competition is not a reasonable goal for America.
5539 2018-12-19 15:40:36 @francoislegault Hey Frank, maybe stop taking Alberta's "dirty money" from Alberta's dirty oil and I think I would respect your stupid comment more. Your province is a leach on other provinces and is always has been. Anything Quebec has built is a result of taking others money.!!

5548 2018-12-19 15:40:04 Idk why there’s a stereotype that females don’t get oil changes.I get mine every 3 months. I keep up with the maintenance of my car, I don’t play

5553 2018-12-19 15:39:49 Alberta can chose from.  Renewable energy (Solar,Wind) can provide a lot of employment... and just like the Oil industry did, many other sectors can gain from a boom in this clean, renewable energy sector.
Alberta and Sask are great places for Solar arrays / Wind energy
5554 2018-12-19 15:39:47 I need go get oil changed done for the beamer blood
5555 2018-12-19 15:39:40 Stop investing in oil and gas, ffs. There’s a timeline for when we need to get our shit together regarding climate change and you investing so much in multi billion dollar oil companies is not helping!
5556 2018-12-19 15:39:32 A long shot, but @Imamofpeace mentioned in the @RubinReport how we are manipulated into change in Islam's favour. Could protests against Canadian oil be such a thing? 
I "follow the money" so which country would have most to gain from a decrease in Canada production?
5557 2018-12-19 15:39:19 The oil industry has made enough profit over the years to reinvest in your own future. If you want to protect your legacy get a plan because there are many Canadians who don’t give a flying fuck if you fail and they don’t want their tax dollars going to your profit.
5558 2018-12-19 15:39:19  Just trying to inform of facts.  There is a lot of misinformation about Canadian oil.  It is the most ethically and environmentally produced oil in the world.  Canadian companies are on the cutting edge of technological advancements, benefiting not only us, but the world.
5559 2018-12-19 15:39:12 also it'll only hold stay there for like 6 months.  the shale wells slow down quick and there isn't the economics to drill replacement wells at the same rate with oil down here.
5560 2018-12-19 15:39:07 Actually Lori, I worked in the Oil Industry for over 20 years and this will do nothing to help those who need it. Also, the tweet was not sarcasm. Sarcasm would have been "Oh good, our Government came up with a plan for companies to borrow themselves out of debt."
5561 2018-12-19 15:39:06 If that's all you got, I'll stick with Bernie and the nurses vs. "Beto" and his oil execs.

5564 2018-12-19 15:38:42 Can what we are witnessing be attributed to a permanent structural shift in the mindset of investors towards oil? If true, it is going to take a significant crisis to reverse this trend. Too many are viewing oil with a disdain similar to racism, bigotry, sexism, etc.
5565 2018-12-19 15:38:40 I've always been too scared. My remedy is warm olive oil with garlic. Then you just use a cotton swab to lightly spread it in your ear (but not the garlic pieces!)

5575 2018-12-19 15:37:55 I agree be prepared because change is constant but I can’t turn my back on the largest most profitable industry in the world. We have a shipping problem in Alberta not a lack of demand. We have the best product in the world. The world wants more Canadian oil not less.

5584 2018-12-19 15:37:13 The country is richly endowed with natural  resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests and minerals - and is  highly dependent on its oil production and international oil prices.  Only Saudi Arabia exports more oil than Norway.
5585 2018-12-19 15:37:07 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an #unicorn: I shall be #anointed with fresh oil. - Psalm 92:10 KJV God is great.
5586 2018-12-19 15:37:06 Darn Dr., you make a good case and make it hard to hold on to my sesame oil bias.  I am actually with you on this.  I also avoid olive oil lately because of reports many distributors lower their bottom line and cut it with a cheaper oil.  It's hard to know which one cuts corners.
5587 2018-12-19 15:37:00 E pain me bros! He brought manu from the depths and gave Europa and Champions League breath of life again. Now, they can look for a reason to start drilling for oil again. Smh!

5599 2018-12-19 15:36:21 It will be happening in more states because of the shrinking of public lands to use for mining/oil drilling.  Also construction of roads, building a border wall causes wildlife to be frightened & not nest in that area.
5600 2018-12-19 15:36:20 Oh American aunty, what were the crude oil prices in 2014 and what are they now?? Also what was the INR rate against dollar in 2014, shamelessness ki hadd hai

5607 2018-12-19 15:35:54 We can make a difference... but we HAVE to change our ways.   We have to stop burning and mining fossil fuels...
We have 6-10 years before climate change will no longer be controllable.  It's not a bad thing for Alberta to phase out the Oil Sands... There are many eco options..
5608 2018-12-19 15:35:50 Thanks for the agreement.  We have had pipelines in the ground shipping oil for almost 70 years in some areas without any of the apocalyptic disaster that opponents often expect.  Let’s hope for a renewed strength in the Canadian oilfield to further contribute our great nation.

5611 2018-12-19 15:35:29 I've had my ears properly flushed at the doctors before. It was amazing, like an inner ear massage. Ask your GP if you can get that done maybe. You put drops of mineral oil in your ears for a week daily ahead of time go soften the wax.

5618 2018-12-19 15:34:42 I think the problem is that Justin Trudreau directly bargained for the oil price differential just in order to punish western oil interests.
Oh wait is that a fiction?

5627 2018-12-19 15:33:51 Sure, The US is right there with Saudi and Russia at somewhere between 10.5-11 million barrels a day.  US oil though is largely private and thus will it contributes to economy it isn't the engine that pays for the govt and citizenry like in russia/saudi/etc

5632 2018-12-19 15:33:30 US oil (crude, products & SPR) inventories declined by 10.74mb to 1,878.73m
5633 2018-12-19 15:33:17 Can we drop the narrative of "cheap oil is stimulative"? We are now a maker, not a taker.

5654 2018-12-19 15:31:24 Crazy thought, what if cheap oil and budget trouble in Saudi Arabia trigger a desperate move - like a pivot to bitcoin. They have cheap energy for mining, announcement would spike price, and game theory would draw in other actors.

If we need all this oil for transport then carry on churning out byproducts easily, reducing demand of oil will drive innovation

5710 2018-12-19 15:28:06 First, I HATE that for the last century the threat of global warming and the potential dangers predicted(back in late 1800's and 1912) were ignored and forgotten about.

5732 2018-12-19 15:26:04 U shouldn’t be involved in a geo political proxy war against us in the first place - the US has no legal basis to occupy our territory and refuse to let us use our own oil for reconstruction money-thus the US exacerbates the situation whilst sitting on its ass talkin about ISIS
5733 2018-12-19 15:26:04 Oil: the price is down NOW as POTUS has supported reasonable drilling.  Bonus is our energy independence and financial pressure on bad guys like Russia and Iran.
And, it can always go lower which would be great for consumers, businesses and intl. negotiations.

@AmapolaFuxia you might be interested in this^^ (Darren's tweet, not my paraphrasing...)
5739 2018-12-19 15:25:29 And here's the rub... If it wasn't for this climate, and a snake oil salesmen in office, we would never have the press describe their days as undergoing a colonoscopy
5740 2018-12-19 15:25:28 does anyone know how we would stop Saudi oil being shipped to canadian refineries? how would the government implement this concept?
5741 2018-12-19 15:25:23 I'm sorry if it's been tough, but the problems are caused by an incompetent government. It's just easier for some snake oil salesmen to point the finger at the EU and immigration rather than find solutions to the problems.

5754 2018-12-19 15:24:24 Oil & gas are taxed at 40% (normal corporation tax is 19%). Petrol and diesel taxes raise about £28bn and oil & gas production about £1-2bn depending on oil prices. Renewable susbsidies are about £10bn per year. You can find all this data on the OBR website.

5757 2018-12-19 15:24:01 This is not true in the slightest. What was the plan exactly if to not take those areas and deprive ISIS from manufacturing oil? Your alternative was to let those areas be controlled by ISIS so they can profit from the oil and control the people that lived there?

5760 2018-12-19 15:23:44 #RRE looking for a friend....Whitman Howard model $70 Brent so a 20% cut to 50% of the cash flows BUT they model 6 $/mcf. Page 18. Price today is 7.8 on Bloomberg on $/mcf which is a 30% upgrade. So at spot cash flows actually go up by 5% assuming no oil hedges. Is this correct?
5761 2018-12-19 15:23:43 WHITE FLOWER OIL. It does wonders.
5762 2018-12-19 15:23:43 Drinking enough water? I take fish oil once a day and it’s helped me feel better
5763 2018-12-19 15:23:32 You really bout to make me video my interior just to prove how false this statement is. I keep mine pretty immaculate. My trunk consists of  visor, cleaning products, towels & an extra oil filter how rude lol
5764 2018-12-19 15:23:31 When is the next cycle? How can we sign up women who need BISP? What is criteria and modus of selection?
5765 2018-12-19 15:23:23 In case you didn’t get the message, #oil is one of the primary drivers of the market here just like in 2015-2016
5766 2018-12-19 15:23:20 Many countries would rather buy Canadian oil because of the environmental regulations we have.
5767 2018-12-19 15:23:19 Great chart! These numbers very likely don't include such "minor" costs as lease acquisition and corporate overheard, which oil companies choose to exclude from their break even calculations.
5768 2018-12-19 15:23:13 Putin wins. Only reason he went there was because you got involved to move weapons. You blink first and leave hundreds of thousands of civilians on deaths door as ISIS regroups. Keep kissing ass of the Oil Cartel.

5770 2018-12-19 15:23:08 yeah he's the conspiracy theorist. says the guy who thinks the russians stole the election using cloak and dagger cyber ops. have you ever asked yourself why the russians would prefer trump? was it increased military spending? increased oil production?
5771 2018-12-19 15:23:05 @1sweetkeke make sure you’re deep conditioning weekly!! I also pre-poo my hair with olive & coconut oil, you can use this mixture on your scalp too 
5772 2018-12-19 15:23:04 You mean we're not going to barge in and claim all the oil in the name of Israel? We're not going to occupy Libya for the next 25 years?  What?
5773 2018-12-19 15:23:00 Bio oil
5774 2018-12-19 15:22:59 Errrr...no, that was Russia. Despite the CIA, McCain and Hillary providing weapons to any old terrorist. Oops, that is freedom fighter when its on oil’s side, isn’t it.
5775 2018-12-19 15:22:50 Yes, please justify Beto. Corporate Beto. Voted to deregulate Wall Street Beto. Voted to fast track corporate TPP Beto. Heaps praise on Apartheid state Israel Beto. Oil and gas slave Beto. He's garbage and won't win, period. Bernie must run and must win.

5777 2018-12-19 15:22:40 I agree with this we made a deal honor it .But time to end oil imports and use our own
5778 2018-12-19 15:22:35 WTI OIL (F19)-Nailed it. Last letter (12/11) we advised traders to get SHORT @  $52.25/53.55 (high since 53.27 on 12/13) looking for a move to $47/46  (adjusted downward to $46/45 on 12/17). #OIL #NYMEX #OPEC

5780 2018-12-19 15:22:18 Just @BillSpadea's support of #Fracking is enough to intensely dislike the dude. Just waiting for the inevitable investigation on his ties to big oil and gas.
Popcorn ready.
5781 2018-12-19 15:22:03 out of oil. dun wanna go into data release.

5783 2018-12-19 15:21:59 I (as a member of Pershing Jr. HIgh School Band) played at the 1963 Bluebonnet Bowl in Rice Stadium - it was 19° and we had an oil drum bonfire  in the Northeast corner of the lower stands to survive the bitter cold.
5784 2018-12-19 15:21:52 I think we can both agree that subsidies for oil companies, aerospace, dairy and automotive companies are bad.
5785 2018-12-19 15:21:44 just a warning to diasporans flying/driving into #zimbabwe this festive season:
- Bring own cooking oil
- Bring own soft drinks
- Bring enough fuel
- Bring enough cash we will show you the market
- Bring serviced fire extinguishers
- @cohsunshinecity water is not guaranteed

5787 2018-12-19 15:21:33 Be aware that it maybe turning point though... You need to be calm and not all in position ever. There is a 45.x in February and rollover already done with volume though there will be a stretch test on it whatever report comes. So no override buys... BE calm. #oott #usoil #oil

5795 2018-12-19 15:21:06 Thanks CBZ. What do you think about oil? Looks like bottomed..
5796 2018-12-19 15:21:06 So Putin focused on the bigger picture and displacement of the dollar as the GRC via the acceleration of the demise of the #Petrodollar given that the Saudis agreed to sell the oil to China for yuan? Hence his delight. Am I interpreting your comment correctly?

5801 2018-12-19 15:20:54 You do realise that the Crude Oil prices dropped from $85 a Barrel to $55 a Barrel? This directly impacts our currency valuation!
5802 2018-12-19 15:20:51 Follow the money trail. Millions pour into Canada to influence oil production and transport by making people more concerned about dead ducks than dead reporters and human rights. If Trudeau was a real feminist this would concern him.
5803 2018-12-19 15:20:49 I'd say they're almost as enviable as friends that bring Barolos from wine banks ;) Dying to know your impressions. I've loved them all. The Rwandan chilli oil my favourite punch of heat.
5804 2018-12-19 15:20:39 @JustinTrudeau you say you’re a feminist and an advocate of human rights globally, so why is Canada still importing Saudi Oil?

5809 2018-12-19 15:20:07 The issue is getting oil from a landlocked province, not offering them debt
I think the minister needs to give the PM more options
I do feel this will start to correct itself by spring, but what may be lost by then
5810 2018-12-19 15:19:53 Totally, I have a go-to pouch that carries face oil, face mist, lip balm, eye drops, and wipes.
5811 2018-12-19 15:19:52 Mkts currently trading like more players are thinking Fed may either not raise rates and/or make dovish forward comments. Oil higher, equities higher, USD Index lower. If outcome not as currently expected afternoon trading will be interesting
5812 2018-12-19 15:19:50 My hair looks so so good today, thank you @ Argan Oil
5813 2018-12-19 15:19:46 What essential oil will get me out of my feelings?
5814 2018-12-19 15:19:44 Don’t need to cut your nose off, keep building for them, stop buying their oil! Pretty simple!

5816 2018-12-19 15:19:41 Then why isn't he working to complete what the court wants? He should be showing people he's doing it if he is. I highly doubt he is after all his "phase out oil" talks.
5817 2018-12-19 15:19:39 Kurds are screwed with teh US pull out...plus Israel gets 77% of all of its external oil from the Kurds... Plus, Syrian refugees WILL COME BACK to Syria...so Europe will like this too.
5818 2018-12-19 15:19:36 Solar is useful for recharging a cell phone, not much else. Imagine the putcry if oil was killing all the birds that the wind choppers do.

5821 2018-12-19 15:19:23 Source? The source of oil prices being the biggest factor on oil industry jobs? 30 years experience in the oil industry. Oil companies spend $ if they can make $.  At lower oil prices they shut in wells, do less maintenance and cancel big projects.  It’s fundamental economics.
5822 2018-12-19 15:19:19 Get it while you can Standard Oil. The trustbusters are coming for you soon.
5823 2018-12-19 15:19:15 Still nobody mentions the Mosul-Haifa pipleline.. Golly.. Seems like everyone would make a killing if that reopened. Except Russia.. Because Israel buys a lot of Russian oil.
5824 2018-12-19 15:19:14 1) XOP is more dominated by shale production near marginal cost than it ever has been
2) After releveraging in 2015/16, firms are in debt and desperately need WTI>$60 to justify their balance sheets (see index debt/equity)
3) Oil's 40% fall is more impactful than even 2008

Heat 1tbsp oil until smoking hot, add the mustard seed, gently agitate until they all go pop...

5829 2018-12-19 15:18:57 For someone who campaigned on taking and keeping the oil @realDonaldTrump if he pulls all US presence in #Syria he’s literally giving the oil rich region to Iran and their Assad regime.

5832 2018-12-19 15:18:44 Ms. Premier, you’re dedication to our industry is admirable. From all of us who work in the oil sector, thank you for being out biggest supporter! Keep up the tireless work.
5833 2018-12-19 15:18:44 Whipsaw is right, work the levels but I prefer noncorrelated like oil/natgas with a sprinkling of 3X market products for events, bear is still amongst us til proven otherwise, I'm trading less quanitity, risk mgnt key, huge moves good for big $$ on less trades.

5835 2018-12-19 15:18:13 The smock and mirrors magic act you are trying to sell to taxpayers is no bueno! That’s like the snake oil salesman coming to sell his worthless goods!
5836 2018-12-19 15:18:01 It's sad that people try to always say "liberals" this or "conservatives" that. They all suck, they all lie, and they all don't do what's best for the people as a whole. But sometimes a bail out is best. Now GM, that's BS, they took the money and leaving anyways. Oil can't leave.

5839 2018-12-19 15:17:51 How about the LIBERALS manipulated gas prices across Canada.Oil down below 50 bucks a barrel and gas prices stuck  from .94 to 106 a Litre. Gas should be 60 cents per litre at the current oil prices. Corporate CEO's and Trudeau LIBERALS corruption on the Market.
5840 2018-12-19 15:17:42 Scheer  must think Canadians are really stupid what Oil co paid him for that one?, or is paying him? Is he in the pocket of the Alberta OIL COs? Thats what it looks like .
5841 2018-12-19 15:17:41 I think the argument that each province is somehow not developing their resources to the fullest of their ability is somewhat.. debatable? Alberta has significant oil reserves that were highly prized for a long time. Not all provinces have that luxury.
5842 2018-12-19 15:17:39 I cannot wait for 100% solar power to come to fruition. The amount of Alberta oil people crying will cheer my cold little heart.

5865 2018-12-19 15:15:27 So peddling bullshit and snake oil is not as profitable as it once was? Here's an idea, try pushing the message of the people to the political elite in D.C. rather than the other way around.
5866 2018-12-19 15:15:21 He has friends among the oil ppl now. Saudis his friends, not friends of Israel. Evilhellicals crank the settlers up, organize guided tours taking American gullible religulous to fleece buying stupid trinkets & making donations, go to Masada expecting to see the hordes come first
5867 2018-12-19 15:15:20 No, it didn’t work. Bootleggers and moonshine, my man. Black market criminals who got rich off flooding an industry with a poor quality product. E.g. as for cannabis currently. Multiple benefits with CBD oil and cannabis. Alcohol? Zero benefits.

5869 2018-12-19 15:15:12 The government could add tariffs to imported oil. We do this on some products. But as a conservative, I should favour a free market. But it doesn’t feel like a free market as is when we can’t build pipelines.

5884 2018-12-19 15:14:25 Regulators taking action will move the stock. Standard oil was still very useful right up until they got broken up. So was AT&T.
5885 2018-12-19 15:14:23 Canada’s self sufficiency in oil has to be a priority , builds competitive advantage for our exporters. Current stonewalling against this end  will never be forgotten. Even Obama had cognitive skills to see this.

5892 2018-12-19 15:13:49 yes - absolutely - show me the Big Oil company who has a credible Paris-compatible carbon descent strategy and I'll be happy to talk. I know Shell is betting on BAU for quite a while yet (& helping to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy)
5893 2018-12-19 15:13:39 I see your argument is based in logic...keep shipping oil across the ocean in diesel burning tankers to promote a cleaner Canada. Good luck!
5894 2018-12-19 15:13:37 Lastly James oil prices rise and fall because of supply and demand. It’s over supply that makes the price go down. If we could get all producers on the same production page the price would never come down. Supply is driven by politics but the demand is only going one way

5898 2018-12-19 15:13:30 Second, the price point including the shipping would be less than Saudi oil ensuring greater profitability in the refining.  Who’s oil do you think they will use?
5899 2018-12-19 15:13:28 Cannabis or cbd oil
5900 2018-12-19 15:13:27 Exactly. It's happened EVERY time we've been on the verge of withdrawal. Fewer people are falling for it each time, yet the MSM breathlessly reports it as "proof" each time that the US needs to continue to illegally occupy Syria... the 30% with the most oil & gas, of course.

5911 2018-12-19 15:12:43 A lot of Australia's economy floats on exporting coal and iron ore to China.  That's not materially different from a petro-state dependent on shipping oil/gas
5912 2018-12-19 15:12:43 Why are you sharing this one? Crude oil prices were in the neighbourhood of $100 during ‘11, ’12, ’13 & ‘14. End of discussion. UPA2 Govt, despite its corruption issues, was able to manage better petrol prices.

5917 2018-12-19 15:12:23 When was the last spill? Specifically a tanker carrying Alberta oil? How about sewage being pumped into the ocean. Fish farms? Seepage from abandoned mines into the oceans? Out break of Cholera on Vancouver Island? The list goes on.

5922 2018-12-19 15:12:05 Hey, you know what would be better than Albertan oil?...an investment in renewable energy to replace fossil fuels entirely...
5923 2018-12-19 15:12:05 @JustinTrudeau @PMcanadien @CanadianPM @CBCPolitics 1.6 Billion okay if given directly to Oil Workers to retrain in Clean Energy & clean energy operations etc -NOT ACCEPTABLE giving a Billion $$ to the Billionaires  AND WHERE is the MONEY 4 the SEARS workers/retirees?
5924 2018-12-19 15:12:04 Anyone that attacks oil companies without advocating for reduced fossil fuel consumption is obviously more interested in hating corporations than helping the environment.
5925 2018-12-19 15:12:04 #Oil dead cat bouncing .

5927 2018-12-19 15:11:53 Why would they retreat after everything gained the oil fields what is the plan
5928 2018-12-19 15:11:53 If you believe that, you have no sense of oilfield economics in Canada.  First, there is a falsehood that this pipeline would only ship the heavy oil bitumen product.  It would ship all grades of Western Canadian oil. The end product would be near the same grade as Saudi oil.
5929 2018-12-19 15:11:44 Some broad $USD selling here tests the resolve of USD longs ahead of the Fed.  #EURUSD at session highs while #USDJPY at session lows.  #USDCAD threatening 1.3430s support again.  #GBPUSD snaps back up into 1.2640-70 trend-line channel.  EIA oil inventories in 15mins.
5930 2018-12-19 15:11:39 Great. They actually were hoping Brent broke out above $80. They bought massive exposure to event risk to the upside when Oil was in the dog house

5936 2018-12-19 15:11:13 IMO Putin shouldn’t have been all smiles w MBS after it had just been announced that Aramco had signed a deal w China displacing Russia as China’s #1 oil supplier...yet he was.  IMO potential big clue there re: the currency terms of Chinese/KSA deal.
5937 2018-12-19 15:11:11 Geopolitical issues play a part in the price of oil by the way. You should know that. Maybe the prez shouldn't ask OPEC to cut supply as supply plays a part in pricing. You should know that too.

I am amazed by the number of people that think drug companies are evil yet still trust their products.

Do people actually think that they want you to get healthy? Thats like oil co wanting you to buy a prius.

5945 2018-12-19 15:10:33 Last time he said that, the deep state pulled a fast one on him so they couldn’t withdraw. I dont doubt same scenario will happen again. They’re not gonna give up all that oil that isn’t theirs cuz of Turkey coming in. This is just empty rhetoric to appease his base. IMO.

5959 2018-12-19 15:09:32 Are you aware that palm oil is the most effecient oil crop, meaning takes up the least land?
5960 2018-12-19 15:09:16 Ah, thanks for that info. I guess by today's standards I still consider $2,700 to be a "not-huge" amount. I get your point that if the majority of these donors were in oil/gas industry we would want to watch closely. Or it might just be that these people can afford $2,700. ;-)
5961 2018-12-19 15:09:14 I really need a lot of convincing about why US must be in Syria it’s pre war oil export is puny, it’s eastern coast is rugged (not good for pipeline), it’s a instability prone region in the first place, and YPG was bringing a ocalan poster during their victory parade in Raqqa...
5962 2018-12-19 15:09:09 Sure they would use western oil, but only to ship offshore. It wouldn't make economic sense to use AB oil exclusively. They want diversity. And at this point in time EE is not economically viable. Otherwise someone would be backing it. They're not.

5971 2018-12-19 15:08:34 .@realDonaldTrump A US withdrawal  from #Syria will be a LOSING strategy not a winning one. Your legacy will be similar to Obama’s when he withdrew from Iraq in 2011. ISIS is NOT defeated, 20-30K fighters remain. Your decision gives oil fields, $ to Iran & Turkey will kill Kurds.

5977 2018-12-19 15:08:06 I'm only going to say this once. If Jason Kenney is elected he is going to privatize and sell your oil to foreign corporates before you can say cowboy! 
If there happens to be any oil industry left for Albertans you'll be looking at half the wages. Good luck
5978 2018-12-19 15:08:00 I don't understand why #ClimateAction folks refer to the "oil sands". They are the #TarSands The oil sands moniker is the result of a successful re-branding campaign by #BigOil PR types & MSM bought into it. Sort of like how 'anti-abortion' became 'pro-life'.

5987 2018-12-19 15:07:34 Cutting another deal with Russia? Just like exemptions given to countries to buy Iranian oil...
5988 2018-12-19 15:07:29 Even the Middle East gets its oil out. Our over-involvement is to what I alluded earlier: our temptation to use our hammer, see every problem as a nail.

But it is the exception to the rule that the U.S. military, the Navy in particular, is the surest force for global peace.

6017 2018-12-19 15:04:05 What I am saying is it will take a few hundred years before the green tech is able to replace oil. I’m not saying it shouldn’t. China also restarted there coal power plant program. If green is taking over I wonder why they did that? We are not going to agree James.

6025 2018-12-19 15:03:10 It annoys me that so many people seem unable to understand that Canada can produce oil AND transition to renewables. Norway produces 3x the oil/capita as Canada and in addition to being being much closer to life beyond oil has billions in savings rather than debt.

6027 2018-12-19 15:03:05 continuous insider buying at poor little beaten to paste $CJ.TO up in canada lately, lends credence to thier statements they likely to revise dividend back up (at least some) in April in my view, built a fair position in this spec. #oil #oott

6034 2018-12-19 15:01:55 No at all, the enormous risks that come with the responsibility to develop the oil and gas resources here are something that albertans have accepted and at times suffered because of. So many lives have been turned upside down during every downturn caused by low oil prices.

6039 2018-12-19 15:01:36 yea but its impossible to recover revenue required through the ratepayers. raising electricity rates will reduce consumption and encourage people to use less energy or switch to oil or go off the grid
6040 2018-12-19 15:01:35 You didn't have any problem with it though when Uncle Hero was paying every plumber, caretaker, gravedigger... millions of dollars for empty ships or oil ladened ships diverted to other countries that never got to the Nigerian market. Selective Amnesia.

6053 2018-12-19 15:00:25 The Petrodollar is one of the strongest foundations of US dominance in the world. One of the most interesting thought experiments is, "What happens if a barrel of oil is represented by a token (on Ethereum) and can trade freely with all currencies?" Scary scenario for the USA.

6056 2018-12-19 15:00:14 Oil is used in pretty much everything
6057 2018-12-19 15:00:11 Let's start with comprehension or you asking about what I am implying versus assuming. In 2015, when oil prices dropped, what happened to the economy? Let's start there. We can then talk further about profits and federal tax revenue.
6058 2018-12-19 15:00:10 Defeating ISIS is a pretty broad statement. Wonder who is advising you? You will see ISIS resurfacing in Yemen for sure. Keep America away from meddling in foreign soil. Saudi is rogue and should never trust them. Convert to renewable energy and rely less on oil.
6059 2018-12-19 15:00:10 And my grade 10 kid clearly has a more fulsome understanding - today he is presenting on climate change in science class - discussing the coal, oil and gas, Co2, Rising Greenhouse gas connection, & our need to drastically lower our carbon footprint, or the population. #kidsknow

6061 2018-12-19 15:00:09 Not because of Rupert Murdoch is on the board of Genie Energy? Not because Genie Energy found more oil in Golan Heights in Syria than in all of Saudi Arabia? You didn't plan to move the Embassy to Jerusalem so  your friends can "take the oil" after a vote on boards?

6062 2018-12-19 15:00:01 Did you read the article?  Irving says it would use Western Canadian oil.  It would stupid for them not to at the discount it provides them.  To think that this would not necessitate a reduction in foreign oil purchases is not an intelligent assumption.
6063 2018-12-19 14:59:57 Oh, my god, @petridishes is a hoot! Love this sentence: “An oil portrait of Donald Trump that could have run feral and terrorized thousands was contained and placed on the wall of a Trump golf club where it could do no harm, except to itself....” Perfection.

6131 2018-12-19 14:54:28 2) Lower oil price typically means a higher flow of oil to refineries, as refineries make more $ on the differential.  Are you not aware of the adage ‘the middle man makes the $’? Pipelines are part of the middle.  Tariffs are consistent.

6152 2018-12-19 14:52:25 Your a pompous ass. Demand is going one way. This is a fact! You talk of tech advances but yet can’t name any that are displacing oil because it’s not significant. Green tech won’t catch up and replace for hundreds of years that is also fact.

6158 2018-12-19 14:52:01 Can you imagine the amount of jobs created if your failing government would have spent the now 6 billion dollars that’s been thrown away to the oil industry instead on renewable energy infrastructure to benefit Canadians now and into the future !

6161 2018-12-19 14:51:51 After US, CAD news U can see AUD is weakest and JPY is the strongest but Lowest crude oil price 46.07$ per Barrel caused CAD be very weak Vs. US, CHF, and EUR US/CAD on Pivot level 1.3455 and U/J goes below 112.30 be ready to go strong support 111.95 of course after Fed decision
6162 2018-12-19 14:51:50 My skin is sooo dry . No matter what oil or cream I put it stays dry and patchy :/
6163 2018-12-19 14:51:43 it's definitely not! their stuff is generally meant for sensitive skins too so if it's burning you might be allergic to something in it? I've used their Vit C and Glycolic and like them a lot (both tingle a little) but the real MVPs are the B Hydra gel and Marula oil
6164 2018-12-19 14:51:39 Fake News! Syria has more oil than Saudi Arabia and the Americans will not go out

6169 2018-12-19 14:50:56 Actually most experts in oil & gas would say the process was fine before. Trudeau's govt is the one that imposed unreasonable extra regulation to shut down the oilsands as he previously stated in an interview.
6170 2018-12-19 14:50:55 The article you cited quotes one economist who comes to this conclusion.  No quotes from industry or pipeline.  The fact remains that new Liberal government policies derailed the Energy East project.  Pipeline tariffs are not impacted by the world oil price.
6171 2018-12-19 14:50:52 Because they did what they set out to do..Steal oil at a bargain price.
6172 2018-12-19 14:50:50 Heartbreaking what’s happening there over last couple years. But hey, corrupt government with a national oil company biggy bank is always good for the people. Socialism works! Not. 
6173 2018-12-19 14:50:47 We need to work with Syria and Qatar on an American pipeline with an honest oil company and have no more Dick Cheney participation over there with the "combined conflict congress" causing the internal conflicts to continue. Those members should go to the war crimes tribunal.
6174 2018-12-19 14:50:47 But they’ll stay because genie oil, Israel said so, and other swell pnac stuff
6175 2018-12-19 14:50:46 Update on the Mantua Creek Fuel Spill 12/19/2018

Crews worked through the weekend maintaining clean-up efforts. The prolonged rains had a positive flushing effect on the creek. Some upstream boons are collecting little to no emulsified oil.  Link in bio

6177 2018-12-19 14:50:41 I have dry skin and the winter makes it even worse! Ever since @NubianNefe told me to add jojoba oil to my moisturizer I’ve been glowing!
6178 2018-12-19 14:50:34 Sometimes, even when the squeaky wheel gets greased, it will eventually break. 
Alberta has made the decision to slow oil production and increase price, while investing over a billion dollars for wind turbines. 
Nothing to do with JT.
6179 2018-12-19 14:50:29 だいほんえ見たいな〜。
6180 2018-12-19 14:50:24 Maybe you should use some of the oil industry money hidden in tax heaven to help out instead of asking the people who have no more. #shamejustin

6183 2018-12-19 14:50:19 Alberta is experiencing market forces that Trudea can do very little about. And Scheer will only make things worse.  The price of oil is what will kill the pipeline. Unfortunately the oil golden goose is leaving Alberta and they have failed to save for a rainy day.
6184 2018-12-19 14:50:19 Northern Gateway was rejected after Enbridge decided the pipeline wasn’t in their best interest. Since then oil tanker traffic has been banned off the North Coast of BC to because of environmental and First Nations’ concerns.
6185 2018-12-19 14:50:09 This is the second really stupid thing you’ve said in the last hour. Discovery will turn up all records of donations (little to nothing from you, much from Linda McMahon, who got SBA gig) and purchases of the oil paintings of you and Tim Tebow helmet. You may be charged.
6186 2018-12-19 14:50:04 Why not wall up the entire US territory and we can catapult big stones and pour hot oil on anyone who tries to breach the defenses.  It worked great in the Middle Ages.
6187 2018-12-19 14:49:35 Those job losses were by the foreign-owned oil companies, yet you blame sockboy?

Alberta pumps record amounts of oil, yet still lays off Canadians.

The blame is with these oil companies.
6188 2018-12-19 14:49:30 No oil...
6189 2018-12-19 14:49:20 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
6190 2018-12-19 14:49:18 I foresee a "lower for longer'' oil price, due in part by @POTUS  desire to see low oil price around the world to support economic development. He can use his leverage with Saudi Arabia to achieve this objective.
6191 2018-12-19 14:49:17 Personally I still can’t get over the image of Green Party leader Stein sitting at a table with Putin! If the oil industry was a person it would be Vladimir Putin!
6192 2018-12-19 14:49:17 15 minutes to a telecon with a Symantec threat researcher based in Dublin about the big threat (cyber attacks) to Big Oil.
6193 2018-12-19 14:49:16 Those are separate things. The whole point is that it isn’t a bust, it’s a lack of capacity to get oil to market. The prices on the global market are fine. The issue is getting it there.
6194 2018-12-19 14:49:12 How do people not understand that @TuckerCarlson is nothing more than a vacuous snake oil salesman in entertainment who has no value in society other than peddling putresance & verbal vomit?
6195 2018-12-19 14:49:11 Apparently you do not understand international power- if we leave which international power will be left holding power in a pivot area between Europe and the oil countries. Oh, Russia benefits- WE GET IT NOW!

6207 2018-12-19 14:48:12 We are paying for it.  This charlatan is selling snake oil to various government agencies, local/state/federal and its diverting investment to true mass transit implementation, something we desperately need to fight climate change and reduce fossil fuel usage.
6208 2018-12-19 14:48:08 This was done to appease Russia/Putin. Who effectively control Syria now. They’ll cut this area up for natural gas and oil transport now. Donnie just hooked up his buddy Putin. How much tax payer $$$ have we spent in Syria again. Just to abruptly leave ?

6210 2018-12-19 14:47:51 Easy: selling oil for CNY/Gold to China and opening up debt issuance in CNY for KSA.  Break Riyal peg with USD and kill #Petrodollar, in exchange for Russia/China military support

6279 2018-12-19 14:43:29 Good stuff. I guess we are still paying the highest price for gas in Canada. But that's all we can do I suppose. It's not like we had any oil in Newfoundland. I know we have our offshore industry here, but that all gets shipped out to the US mostly.

6287 2018-12-19 14:42:53 If you navigate the grocery store and make healthy purchases, portion sizes and preparation are the next hurdle. 

For example, fresh, green vegetables cooked (or dressed) with “healthy” olive oil can easily become a calorie bomb. (3)
6288 2018-12-19 14:42:49 Let's pour oil on it  so when they climb they'll slide the heck down. I refuse to pay for anyone who invades our country.  I work darn hard for my $$$.

6321 2018-12-19 14:39:47 I favor drilling in ANWR but reality is we will need to continue to import oil from the Middle East because of blending needs. North American crude has different characteristics than crude from other parts of the world. But we can and should become an increasingly net exporter
6322 2018-12-19 14:39:43 Considering you are bent on making sure the oil sands flows on unchecked, the irony of “doing nothing to help the environment” is making my head spin.
6323 2018-12-19 14:39:36 N the oil?
6324 2018-12-19 14:39:34 I’m a pro at getting my oil changed. #whereallmymoneygoes
6325 2018-12-19 14:39:27 Yes since the line 9 reversal 48% of Quebec’s oil supply is now coming from Canadian supply. I don’t dispute the EE pipeline is for export as well. There was to be 2 ports until the one near Montreal was removed due to it being to close to beluga whale calving grounds

6329 2018-12-19 14:39:13 Mopar gave me a discount on a oil change...guess I’ll start the new year with some fresh engine oil
6330 2018-12-19 14:39:10 No, because Canada does not buy oil. Irving Oil buys oil. Give their head office a call and ask why they are buying KSA oil. Maybe start a boycott of Irving pumps. Just stop thinking that govts are in the oil importing business.
6331 2018-12-19 14:39:08 What kind of oil would you recommend?

6355 2018-12-19 14:36:35 Read Lawrence Solomon’s article. There is also something called common sense. You take the 3rd largest oil reserve out of any country it would be devastating to its currency.
6356 2018-12-19 14:36:31 He literally just handed the oil sector billions of dollars. Hopefully they will use it to create jobs in sustainable industry and not carbon generation. Go home.

6365 2018-12-19 14:35:46 Sanctions or tariffs on Saudi oil will have retaliation and would likely lead to the deal still ending, but at least that way Canadian taxpayers aren't paying the penalties. Different path to the same location, though I think this might be a better way to get there.

6375 2018-12-19 14:34:50 I agree! We need to pressure our government to regulate our social media platforms like Facebook. Even if the boycott works, it will not stop a different media platform (Twitter & Youtube) from doing the same. Standard Oil comes to mind!!!!

6388 2018-12-19 14:33:37 "However, the report states that the UK is providing subsidies in the form of tax breaks for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea and the decommissioning of oil".
6389 2018-12-19 14:33:30 Dovish Fed obviously most critical.Modest reductions in US production will support oil below $50 with Diamondback today lowering drilling.Demand for gas will increase substantially with gas prices lower.

6396 2018-12-19 14:32:29 Not sure if it was a misstep on DB part. They got away with just paying finesx for fraud before. So they are just arrogant. And may be like BP was with the oil spill in the Gulf, politically judgement proof. But Kennedy nor Trump should be. They need to be accountable.

6424 2018-12-19 14:30:27 England's building a few windmills of our own, after years of subsidising small windmills on every hill in the lowlands. They'll still stop when there's no wind & we'll not need yours when the wind blows. Good luck selling it to Norway. We're planning on not needing your oil too.

6428 2018-12-19 14:30:10 That recipe is very different from the one I grew up with. My grandfather's uses no milk just hot water. The only ground spice is nutmeg which is added as a garnish. The key in his is oil of cinnamon and oil of clove. Interestingly, he also specifies the island to source the rum.
6429 2018-12-19 14:30:06 I need to get some camellia oil for my whole body.
6430 2018-12-19 14:29:54 God bless you bro..Donald duke goofed again. It is a forecast and Analysts forecast oil in 2019 will hover around $73 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

What gave him the feelings that it will increase in 2019? So you eat your profits before you realise them

6539 2018-12-19 14:20:30 I swear by Boiron's occillococonum. Within 24 hours you will feel better. Oil of oregano drops in water tastes awful but seems to kill the bug. Also, get a new toothbrush or put your old one through the dishwasher, and wipe down everything with vinegar & water-phone, keyboard etc

6546 2018-12-19 14:20:05 We know the Russians wanted sanctions relief. We also know from the Steele dossier that Trump was offered 19.5% of Rosneft Oil. If there was no quid pro quo deal of any kind, nothing to hide. But I think a deal WAS made, and that’s what’s hiding under all that black ink.
6547 2018-12-19 14:20:04 I'm sorry but I'm not driving almost an hour to Baltimore for an oil change.

6551 2018-12-19 14:19:45 50% of the flight cost is fuel cost & unfortunately we are not oil rich, while Aviation policy should be fixed before expecting (even) break even from PIA.
6552 2018-12-19 14:19:44 Stop kidding. For years Turkey let ISIS and other jihadi groups cross its open border with Syria. Even ISIS members call Turkey an ally. Turkey was smuggling oil from ISIS and delivered gun. Turkey has created ISIS.

6554 2018-12-19 14:19:25 Obviously cooking the sprouts wrong :) roast them for about 25 mins with a little oil, salt & sugar and they come out lovely, tasting like seaweed from the chinese (which, given it's deep fried cabbage with salt and sugar, is hardly surprising!)

I'll never boil a sprout again.

6569 2018-12-19 14:18:29 All these countries need more expensive oil to make their budgets work.  Nigeria, Russia, Saudi, etc  (Iran, Brazil and Venezuela have even bigger problems). Nigerias govt will implode over low prices, Putin's promises were based on like 115/bbl oil.
6570 2018-12-19 14:18:16 Yes we do thank them very much because we’re all in this together. It’s in the Saudi’s best interests as well. The oil economy is coming to closure and the Saudi’s other investments are crucial to their and the world’s future.

6578 2018-12-19 14:17:43 That's a combination and a half! Sounds good though. Thanks!

I've been drinking emernec every morning first thing when I wake up, and taking a shot of my oil of oregano - which usually works - once when I wake up and before bed. 

I'm definitely going to try your remedy ! Thanks
6579 2018-12-19 14:17:40 Yes, but not in Alberta, Ca. The money is made elsewhere, as the demand for Oil rises. Lefties are too dumb and agenda driven to figure this out

6581 2018-12-19 14:17:27 Addendum: I believe in fair trade (China and steel should be addressed) and as for oil production, we are well on are way to where we are today (production vastly increased under Obama).
6582 2018-12-19 14:17:27 Can we pump oil through that pipe?

原監督の甥である菅野さんを紹介されたのですが、菅野さんは大学生くらいのころ深夜ビクターでアルバイトされたことはありますか？
6584 2018-12-19 14:17:09 He also received donations from employees from oil companies, as well as from employees and execs from other industries. Can you make a persuasive case that his opinion is informed by those individual donations?

I haven't seen where he took money from oil and gas industry PACs.

6591 2018-12-19 14:16:42 Lower demand for oil, trade wars, Brexit, rising interest rates, falling markets! Is a recession around the corner?

6597 2018-12-19 14:16:16 Yes, that exact meaning, and we're the same country our dear neighbour is so keen to keep a hold of for want of losing vast oil and gas reserves and taxes, plus other resources critical to its economy. Scotland bound ensures England looks like a big country with an empire.

6611 2018-12-19 14:15:25 That foreign oil would be displaced is highly speculative. Irving Oil even stated publicly that Saudi oil would not be displaced. I’m not arguing against the pipeline, but that it would be overwhelmingly an export pipeline.

Wyoming is a lightly populated, prosperous place with an economy resting on natural resources. Oil, coal, gas & uranium
6623 2018-12-19 14:14:32 The purchase of feedstock is not made due to nationalistic concerns (AB oil is not preferred to foreign by private comp.). Purchasing is based on type of crude, price, expected demand (product), etc. The price differential for light (ex. CLS) isn’t favourable like it is for WCS.
6624 2018-12-19 14:14:26 Of course, unbelievable reserves of oil. Would the US leave it with sucking every drop of it. Professional killers and thieves.

6628 2018-12-19 14:14:12 U.S. Oil Prices Down Almost 40% From High.  (Think we should thank the Frackers for this one. Obama said we could not drill our way out of a crisis. But a few far-sighted, gutsy individuals did, thus helping the nation more than he ever did.)

6630 2018-12-19 14:13:59 WTI Midland #oil is $39. Marginal cost of production is about $42. However, it is all meaningless really... for many reasons ... Note,  current #OPEC + agreement looks shaky and if we go back to November 2014 situation, the marginal cost becomes the Saudi one, which is below $10.

No-one nowadays sees merit in 'owning' countries in that traditional way. Too much bad press.

Look at Ireland....handed over our oil for a pittance. Rich cunts getting richer.

6649 2018-12-19 14:12:44 Your name is @Shell_Canada, why aren't you standing up for canadians?  Tell them the truth.  There is no shortage of oil & gas & will never be.  Tell them also the carbon tax is not necessary, that carbon is not causing any problems.  In fact, less carbon will cause a problem.
6650 2018-12-19 14:12:44 It's the oil mans conundrum, played out by province. Why doesn't my family love me, I give them all this money, they should love me.

6651 2018-12-19 14:12:41 Anyone who is not a Conservative voter or a separatist should be rallying behind Rachel Notley and voting for Alberta's NDP, unless you are a deeply committed environmentalist and can't support NDP because of their overt support of Big Oil. Then vote Green if you can, or abstain.

6658 2018-12-19 14:12:08 De risking from reliance on Oil based countries is a must. First step is electric cars then harness and allow, natural organic energy such as use of air, sun and water. Sadly governments want the ££$$

Perhaps you could answer this first, rather than expecting me to answer a question you put to me an hour ago.

6693 2018-12-19 14:09:21 That is saying they will double their production of natural gas?  Use more natural gas and solar domestically to free up further income producing oil exports?

6695 2018-12-19 14:09:15 I hope that you are right about inflation.  The correlation between oil prices and inflation has weakened significantly since the 70s. Do you think that Obama should have let the Great Recession turn into the Great Depression?

6792 2018-12-19 14:01:20 Key thing to remember is that a lot of these big laterals in Permian make a lot of their oil in the first 6-7 months. You frac when prices are down and you extend your payout greatly. 1000 bpd initial, 400 bpd after 6 months. Kills your payout senerio.
6793 2018-12-19 14:01:18 That's exactly why he's doing fuck all for Alberta, or do you think this is supposed to help the oil industry?
6794 2018-12-19 14:01:13 You can't just bash on oil and coal when that's what's keeping the country powered. Ocean's waves, wind, solar, etc are all great resources. Yeah, you have to continue using oil & coal until there are feasible replacements. Can't just flip a switch. It's a process. #MAGA

6803 2018-12-19 14:00:29 Really?! Canadians subsidize the oil and gas industry to the tune of about $4 b per year. That’s before Trudeau’s pledge of another 1.6b this week.

6805 2018-12-19 14:00:26 These are facts, buddy, not campaign messages. Receiving money from the Saudis, Wall Street, Oil etc are facts. It just happens that the policies are very friendly towards those who donate - to her foundation or to her campaign.

6829 2018-12-19 13:58:17 True that, but they also weren't expecting the 10 yr yield to crash from 3.25% to 2.812% as I type almost guaranteeing an inversion of the 2 and 10. Seems like and odd thing to do when the facts have changed. Oil down, housing softening, etc.
6830 2018-12-19 13:58:01 and also coming in will be lower earn on S&P. a lower GDP, higher volatility and more. Something beside supply/demand is going on in oil and that doesn't portend good things either. 2019 may be the exact opposite of 2017.
6831 2018-12-19 13:57:59 Why not send a fact finding mission to the south, find out if oil revenues has been distributed equitably. The UN mission and its representative are allied with the Muslim brotherhood that rule Libya now, their facts are not based on reality on the ground

6882 2018-12-19 13:52:09 #SaudiArabia plans to increase state spending by more than 7% in an effort to spur economic growth. This Budget (will be in deficit by $35 B) implies oil at $80 per barrel. The Govt needs $95 to breakeven in order to avoid above deficit. 

Current oil price though is < $50
6883 2018-12-19 13:52:00 Oops, I have written 2013, the data is actually from 2015. Just updated in a separate tweet. Rest is all correct, the crude oil prices have gone significantly up but petrol prices are actually lower now.

6923 2018-12-19 13:47:59 Ohhhh, I just realised, the data that I have written as 2013, is from 2015. Rest all is correct. Crude oil prices have gone significantly up but petrol prices are lower. But the data is not 2013, but it should be 2015. Will share the update in a separate tweet!

The drop is mainly due to a fall in oil and gas prices.

7038 2018-12-19 13:37:17 Yea... the government does not cut checks to gas and oil companies. Allowing them to keep more of their money, as in reduced taxes, is not a subsidy. Solar/wind etc actually receive checks. Big diff.

Takeaway is that Solar/Wind are not financially viable without subsidies.

7056 2018-12-19 13:36:18 I don’t even want #Scotland to join the EU once we become #independent. With our population and keeping all profits from tourism exports clean energy plus the oil we will have about £1mill to spend per head, we will literally be so rich we could just use gold as currency ..
7057 2018-12-19 13:35:56 @angusenergyplc #angs can turn this negative day to a positive one in one second though, just tweet us 1 picture of oil out of the ground and it will light a fuse that wont stop burning!!

7062 2018-12-19 13:35:15 Wow you are a special kind of stupid. Done more for oil industry how? Harper approved and had over 8000 kms of pipeline built under his watch and trugrope has built 0 kms,just does lip service and throws our money at it in Hope's it will go away

7064 2018-12-19 13:34:46 Exactly knowledge of HSE in petroleum chemical sector is very important that why its compulsory course in university courses related to oil and gas.

7069 2018-12-19 13:33:49 Well higher crude oil diffs, strong freight rates indicate refiners still see good refinery margins. Falling crude inventories (except US) also indicate crude is sdemanded. Only can look at what physical markets for crude are saying. Market may be tighter than $45 oil suggests

7073 2018-12-19 13:33:20 You can imagine having these wonderful projects before we start selling our oil.Uganda must shine more when our oil starts to be sold.
7074 2018-12-19 13:33:12 LOL the take for Norway on the same barrel count was 9BILLION s tell me why are UK gov GOVING OIL AND GAS AWAY to companies who didn't ask for a tax brake but gov gave them one anyway!
92% they take Mark
92%,would England take 8% Mark?

7082 2018-12-19 13:32:07 The oil production is a combination of ALL your oil, condensate & gas production - it is measured in barrels of oil equivalent.
As for the interest rate.....hmmmmm....I no know where the single digit go come from....but make we dey look

7101 2018-12-19 13:30:11 And this is just the kind of nasty talk which arouses the already pained emotions of those Alberta oil workers terrified to lose their very rich jobs. It is literally pitting Canadians against one another. Is that leadership? Not in my mind.

I’m tired of Quebec messing things up. Make no mistake where Justin’s loyalty is!
7106 2018-12-19 13:29:43 Big deal!, China can afford to shut down some crummy little oilfield because they can afford oil at any price from anywhere in the world. They don't care about envronment at all.

7126 2018-12-19 13:27:20 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
7127 2018-12-19 13:27:10 The democrats were just selling snake oil to their dumber voters. No impeachment, even if they did what do you expect in a GOP senate other than a new Justice?
7128 2018-12-19 13:27:04 At least the Chinese have not destroyed countries in the middle east and murdered millions in the process and do all this on lies about   WMD's when all the while take the oil of these countries, and arm the Saudi's to kill more innocent people in Yemen. But YEA the bad Chinese!
7129 2018-12-19 13:26:43 Thought it was in need of an oil change and MAYBE a plug messed up cheap though, ended up being a million things and pnly fixed the main so it would run, at least, still was 500$.
7130 2018-12-19 13:26:32 in case you were wondering: cloud dough (cornflower and oil) is an absolute nightmare to remove from the carpet...
7131 2018-12-19 13:26:31 I think it is more.  Rexxon makes artic drilling deal w/Russia who invades Ukraine for pipelines and annexation of Crimea for oil export oh but sanctions. 19.5% Roseneft sold. Not just a tower.
7132 2018-12-19 13:26:20 Domestic natural gas output has declined marginally by 0.6% during the
current fiscal year. Fall in production can be mainly attributed to the
decline in production from fields operated by Oil India and private or
Joint Venture operators (PSC fields)
7133 2018-12-19 13:26:10 Let see you do without oil or oil products.

7139 2018-12-19 13:25:37 Cheers and jeers as @NGRPresident presents @AsoRock ‘s N8.8trn #Budget2019 to opposition-led @NASSNigeria. Estimated revenue of N6.97 trillion made up of Oil: N3.73trn, Non-Oil: N1.39trn & Others: N1.85trn. As election beckons, your guess on timely passage and implementation?
7140 2018-12-19 13:25:29 by stopping producing more oil and coal and investing heavily in renewals, recycling, carbon clean up... then maybe. If you're talking about fracking, plastics, coal as you still are, then No. #climatechange
7141 2018-12-19 13:25:28 Oil and gas production

7144 2018-12-19 13:25:09 If I’m not mistaken I think coconut oil is comedogenic meaning it clogs the pores...so you probably not allergic probably just have to use less product
7145 2018-12-19 13:25:05 My mom asked me early af to take her car to get a oil change She should’ve paid for mine...I need one too!

7150 2018-12-19 13:24:35 Venezuela is going to a paradise when they overthrow Maduro and once again become a typical Latin American right wing neoliberal system.  This proven system has served that region so well the last 100 years. The revenues from the oil will eradicate poverty like it did before.

7157 2018-12-19 13:23:59 If gas prices dip below $2 come spring oil and gas stocks should see quite a rally as gas inventory draws will be larger than normal...question is can anyone see that far ahead?
7158 2018-12-19 13:23:55 All right. Who's got a good gingerbread recipe? I need a roll-out  gingerbread recipe which does not involve Crisco/Trex. I love cookie recipes that use olive oil. Bonus points if you have one of those.

7160 2018-12-19 13:23:49 Nigeria is an oil exporting countries and selling a similar crude oil grade with US shale so it should not be a surprise.

7165 2018-12-19 13:23:15 This person is obviously not any kind of mechanic. Reading his statement, he doesn't  understand the multiple role that oil does in an engine. And that sir, is why U cannot sue Walmart.
7166 2018-12-19 13:23:15 Drawing any direct correlation between the ghosts of rate hikes past and today’s would disregard the tightening of financial conditions, drop in stocks, rout in oil, or continued trade war escalations that have occurred between September and now.
7167 2018-12-19 13:23:14 You buying oil yet?

7169 2018-12-19 13:23:04 having a oil cartridge and a vape pen changed my life in a single day. I needed a break from the burn of a blunt. This still gives me the cough and high without the sleepiness/ body effects from the tobacco.
7170 2018-12-19 13:22:58 Tony Blair saw the writing on the wall. So cut a deal with Donald Dewar to make him look like a devo hero while taking a slice of oil and gas revenue. Slab are not Scotland’s friends.

7182 2018-12-19 13:21:34 I’ve noticed butter makes the eggs taste way better rather than regular or corn oil.

7184 2018-12-19 13:21:30 Any idea of the history here?  Me neither,  but maybe we should be asking the oil companies who have always sold to whoever they want??

7195 2018-12-19 13:19:54 Having said all that I think we need to vote Green because Brexit will be a mere irritation when climate chaos hits. Indeed I believe it has all been stirred up to stop us uniting to fight the forces of evil that want to extract every last bit of oil before the shit hits the fan
7196 2018-12-19 13:19:53 The US has enough oil in its own territory to supply all americans with oil for years. This was even in habertürk. They dont Need it. Assad needs it. Thats why they are There.
7197 2018-12-19 13:19:36 Donald Trump seems to think that the ideal oil price is near 0.
7198 2018-12-19 13:19:34 My guess is the fate of this money is similar to the fate of Gaddafi's missing gold and as the millions of barrels of oil in Iraq that mysteriously went missing during the Iraq war.
7199 2018-12-19 13:19:30 Not everyone who is unemployed is a manual labourer or has the skills to be one and they didn’t all work in oil and gas.

7201 2018-12-19 13:19:22 My guess is something like, "We don't give a shit about Crimea. It's yours. The President-elect wants a cut of your oil business in return, though."

7203 2018-12-19 13:19:12 Hi Natalie. Sorry to hear about your surgery. I would start with Shiseido Ultimune to boost your skin's immunity. Then a good facial oil like Clarins Blue Orchid oil will help.

7216 2018-12-19 13:17:48 I’d only order veggies when out at restaurants and they’d come slathered in oil and full of salt. I didn’t notice how bad it was until after I’d eaten clean for 3 weeks.

7239 2018-12-19 13:15:23 Rupee ended stronger against the US Dollar. However, Rupee pared most of the gains as some banks exited their short bets on the Dollar. Importers' Dollar purchases coupled with the rise in crude oil prices weighed on the sentiment.

7250 2018-12-19 13:14:26 Mr DeSantis, the 1st Law that you should sign is "Gas Price". The same way that gas stations raised prices when oil price goes up, the same way they should reduce prices when oil price goes down. Here in Miami, we still.paying $3 a gallon.

7267 2018-12-19 13:12:58 But if this oil price collapse is due to bank&c. In order to avoid any interest increase why Fed should be so dependent? Yeah economy growth is slower but a 25BP is not the end of this financial world... or as old  ECB president made a terrible mistake?

7278 2018-12-19 13:11:10 Until we increase refining capacity, we will always import oil. We do not possess the refining capacity to completely end foreign oil imports. You could build 10 pipelines to Quebec and it wouldn't make a lick of difference in the domestic market.
Pipeline is good for export only

7281 2018-12-19 13:10:56 the decision to leave and go our own way. We've fulfilled our obligation to Canadians a hundred times over, all the while being denigrated as people and our exports were essentially blockaded. Oil doesn't make Alberta great. If that's all it was Saudi and Nigeria would kick ass..
7282 2018-12-19 13:10:47 Picked up a can from Trader Joe’s and they added a 4th flavor. Olive Oil. Smdh.
7283 2018-12-19 13:10:37 Because oil’s real problem is oversupply, which translates into more ton-miles. Meanwhile, demand holds up until it doesn’t
7284 2018-12-19 13:10:36 Maybe it’s me but the answer seems to found in simplicity- the consumption of oil moves +/- ... 2-3% ? Guessing. The production of oil swings waaaay wider. The ALTERNATIVES are now approaching / exceeding oil use GROWTH. There is no upside for TOTAL oil. Tipping point ?
7285 2018-12-19 13:10:27 …ぐぅ

1.Oil Benchmark of $60barrels/day
2.2.03mbpd of Crude Oil production (Including condensates)
3.NGN305/USD Exchange rate.

7301 2018-12-19 13:08:51 Optimists say there will be no more oil in 75 years, pessimistics say it will be in 25 years.  No matter what, we will have to learn to do things otherwise... or there will be a pretty bad problem upcoming.  Plus, oil is creating CO2 which is a great cause of global warming.
7302 2018-12-19 13:08:37 EA = euro area.
Yes, but since the CBs has no influence on the oil price, which also is very volatile, they focus more on core inflation

7311 2018-12-19 13:08:07 Must be the hand of destiny. The Pentagon is a human rights organisation promoting peace and love and occupying the oil-rich regions of Syria is just an unintended result as the US has never been interested in oil. I can assure you, oil, money, world dominance mean nothing to US.

7315 2018-12-19 13:07:27 What if oil go down like $40
7316 2018-12-19 13:06:57 I’m listening to it now while I’m getting an oil change 
7317 2018-12-19 13:06:53 Listen Alberta, I get it. Change is hard. You’ve thrived off of oil for decades. You’re scared to change (for the better of the world), but fuck you’re gonna kill us all because you’re being selfish.

7323 2018-12-19 13:06:32 My 2cents: Certainly possible. A cache is needed for it to work however.  Think about how oil is pumped through your car; the pump must have oil always available. That is the function of the oil pan; provide a cache of oil so that the pump never runs dry. QED #xpool

7336 2018-12-19 13:05:25 Have you ever heard of equalization payments?! We import oil across the ocean in diesel hungry tankers to our country to refine a raw good, into finished goods like the gasoline and diesel bought in the east. While we have cheap raw goods here already that need to be refined.

7495 2018-12-19 12:44:51 Do you know about, fraudulent "oil bonds"?? 
Lakhs of crores of them being created by UPA fraud,
 was the reason for lower petrol price in 2013, not charity

when crude was double of today's price.
These are being serviced & repayed by modi govt.
7496 2018-12-19 12:44:47 No one’s made bigger “mistakes” than you, like the Trump Foundation, which you’ve finally been forced to close as a scam. I’m sure the donors are quite pleased that you spent $10,000 of their money to commission an oil painting of yourself, now nearly worthless.

7503 2018-12-19 12:43:46 US annual oil production is 19% higher than that of #2 Saudi Arabia. US annual natural gas production is 9% higher than that of #2 Russia. China is #7 in oil and #6 in gas, but #1 in total energy consumption. We are the world’s energy powerhouse.

7506 2018-12-19 12:43:34 We dont know yet if TREASON applies. Although we aren't in a shooting war with Russia, the benefits to Russia and Saudi Arabia  are just emerging. I think this has to do with the price of Oil. Before the election, Russia and Saudi Arabia were BORROWING MONEY!
7507 2018-12-19 12:43:32 Have you researched how many bands are upset because they want the pipeline? Your rhetoric is based on what the liberals are wanting u to believe funded by foreign organizations. Let's continue to fund horrible conflict oil from Saudi.

7659 2018-12-19 12:27:40 The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today, but may cut the number of hikes it anticipates next year in the face of market volatility, a collapse in oil prices, and cooling trade activity.

7660 2018-12-19 12:27:34 From the perspective of a one time energy PR chap, it's not the "oil is bad" driving this story, it's the perceived hypocrisy - an ongoing challenge that is at the heart of the Jamie Oliver brand. But, any chance to get a dig in at "fossil fuel" companies.

7665 2018-12-19 12:26:35 Depends on what type of Dal you're cooking. The standard method is to cook your lentils in the most boring way possible, basically just water (adding salt after they're cooked) and then stir through some of the most violently flavoured oil that you can.
7666 2018-12-19 12:26:22 @YourMorning @BenMulroney Quite a push for the oil industry by Your Morning, disregarding the “enviros” and general disgust for the Liberal Government and their “loan”. It was a Party Politicsl broadcast on behalf of the Conservative party. Maybe Mulroney’s had his day. @CTVNews
7667 2018-12-19 12:26:14 Clearly, Kavanaugh is a creepy crawly snake, whose number one cheerleader is a snake oil salesman. Right wing Americans have lost their moral compass. Will we recover? God only knows.
7668 2018-12-19 12:26:09 I think we live in a day that only the algo knows the true supply / demand of the oil market. We can all rest assured it will never reveal equilibrium as it makes it’s take on volatility.
7669 2018-12-19 12:26:07 All countries’ CPI will feel the oil impact clearly, but not exactly the same. Depends on the weights in the countries CPI baskets. For instance, energy has a lower weight in the DK basket compared to the EA. But remember from a CB perspective, we look more on core inflation

7672 2018-12-19 12:25:39 I certainly appreciate that angle.  I agree that Trump is consistently underestimated.  I feel that his tweets on the economy lack consistency.  You can't have a booming economy, low rates, and $20 oil.

7770 2018-12-19 12:13:20 Good points Adam. Maybe refining it here in the great white north would lower the price at the pumps?

7773 2018-12-19 12:13:13 Sounds like good reason to tighten up labour laws in the province. There are oil and gas companies who are not good to their employees as well. They just tend to get paid more for the abuse.
7774 2018-12-19 12:12:49 Also applies to the oilsands naysayers. Don’t like it? Then pls turn off your lights, don’t drive your car, don’t use most of your STUFF & oh, if you don’t want to use Canadian crude, next choice is Saudi oil?  See how this circles back?? You cannot get away from it. Hypocrites.

7778 2018-12-19 12:12:35 The oil industry has only contributed less than 10% to our GDP, not as much as you guys like to think.  Just because Alberta was rolling in it for a while, doesn’t mean everyone was.   Wasn’t most of the ppl working there from the Maritimes?
7779 2018-12-19 12:12:23 IMO, OPEC should come into extend to stabilize oil price that drop due to politics... if OPEC doesn’t help, who will?

7809 2018-12-19 12:08:58 There is only 1.1% of renewable energy in the world today. So oil is not going anywhere for a good long time. And if you would rather the money go to someone else instead of us to build hospital roads schools etc. And employe 100000 fellow countryman.

7819 2018-12-19 12:07:29 No government interference needed. The oil isn’t accessible. I’m certain if it was already there and cost effective they would buy it. Or am I wrong.

7838 2018-12-19 12:05:04 Oil prices are going down but diesel prices aren't. This bolsters the argument that deregulation can't happen unless the vast majority of the petroleum products consumed Nigeria is locally refined. Even a deregulated diesel market is not cartel free. What a paradox of a country

8028 2018-12-19 11:39:40 Very cool!

For health reasons, I tend to avoid meat substitutes, which contain lots of oil and salt as a substitute for the tasty flavor of meat.

I eat beans as a substitute for meat, and I limit fats, including especially oils. I sometimes have tofu in a miso soup.

4. They have subcontracted their persecution of Jews out to today’s Nazis, the Palestinians, whom they pay per head for every Jew slaughtered. 

5. They are stupid & don’t realize that oil is the new technology & Israel is the new OPEC.
8036 2018-12-19 11:38:35 No, we refine oil. Can't make an EV without oil refineries. Plastics lubricants etc depend on it, petrol is one of the first products that comes out of the process. Can't get plastic without petrol.

8057 2018-12-19 11:36:20 I think a small increase when inflation was rising and above target still looks reasonable. It is now trending to target even though there has been a sharp drop in oil prices so it feels like they’re getting it spot on at the moment.

8070 2018-12-19 11:35:51 Isso impacta uma vasta cadeia produtiva. Outra razão e que a queda do preço do oil sinaliza baixa demanda industrial futura. Ou seja sinalizador precoce de baixo crescimento / recessão futura

8074 2018-12-19 11:34:55 Have you checked for cheap USO calls, slightly otm with 60 days to expiration? The trouble with those is they are only tradable during rth but if oil rises to 60 within the next 2 months, those calls will be worth something.

Are you proposing statist nationalization of the oil industry to remove *all* foreign interference?
8078 2018-12-19 11:34:23 And with that you demonstrate that you've no desire to be taken seriously. we'll not disappoint you in that desire. Like all BritNat shills you would be unable to justify oil being a curse to Scotland without the UK but a stupendous boon to Norway. Off you pop, chancer.

8153 2018-12-19 11:22:26 Always ask FIRS to deconstruct its collection. FIRS collection includes Petroleum Profit Tax which is counted as oil revenue.  PPT is mainly driven by oil prices. This is why current collections of FIRS is nearly equal to that of 2014. 

CIT and VAT are improving in recent years.

8223 2018-12-19 11:13:22 It was suspected for the following reason:
Foriegn reseve falled by 20%  this year only
Oil price still low by 25% than the required price
Geopolitical problems in the region ; Iran sanctions and yemen war

8229 2018-12-19 11:12:34 IMO it’s going to be hard for them to push interest rate much higher. Where is the economic growth? Not in ag, oil, auto.
8230 2018-12-19 11:12:19 After all God has given every one the same dose of time. And besides the parable on my mind is that of the ten virgins in Math 25:1-13 .

8417 2018-12-19 10:43:39 Since interested, this is called thin-film interference. Usually when petrol is dropped on a rainy road, the top surface of the oil (the one facing the air) & the bottom surface of the oil (the one facing the water) both can reflect light, which result rainbow-like colors

Now as an OPEC member, the country looses its autonomy to increase its oil production above the set quota.

This implies that the pact has limited the country's autonomy to alter it's production.

8579 2018-12-19 10:16:54 WARNING.... We had oil production up before. Doesn't anyone else remember what happened? The oil cartel increased supply & lowered the cost/ barrel. Our oil companies lost $ and shut down because they need a  larger margin under the tax burden.
Have we learned nothing?

8632 2018-12-19 10:11:14 Oil will flow initially but it's the RAPID DECLINE rate afterwards which will take the juice out of it in a FLASH and this is why #ANGS is a SCAM! Tideswell sold out but had to buy back to avoid jail sentence as the regulators stepped in, right vonky @angusenergyplc ?

8641 2018-12-19 10:10:11 I was paraphrasing the video that I linked. Essentially, it was advocating steps like taking tax breaks away from coal and oil and giving them to the renewable sector. Suddenly there's a market. And once there's a market, economies of scale kick in, and the product gets cheaper.

8650 2018-12-19 10:08:58 I call bullshit.  The price of oil is down.  There's no economic incentive for further exploration and drilling.  The ACA's impact is economically negligible in this matter (it is a constant, not a variable, and thus doesn't explain the economic downturn).  1/

8737 2018-12-19 09:56:30 Exactly, being more comfortable does not guarantee that your comfort will be sustained. The comfort was hinged on easy flow of money, higher crude oil prices and a deliberate effort to defend the currency. It was not sustainable and we're feeling the brunt now.

Besides which, #palmoil is only used in bread, cake, pies, soap, margarine, peanut butter etc because it's cheap compared to locally produced products like rapeseed oil. Why is a product from halfway round the world so cheap?

Okay she didn't, but slice & pan fry w/ garlic, olive oil, maybe a small squeeze of lemon - perfection. Add broc buds to complete any salad.

8896 2018-12-19 09:39:11 Yesterday, December 18, Brent and WTI crude oil broke through support and refreshed lows. This is due to the slowdown in the global economy as well as GDP. Consumers do not observe production cuts and are in no hurry to buy them.
8897 2018-12-19 09:39:08 Savage reaction in share price. Note to self : stay away from small companies in oil and gas sector, I don't think I've had one that I managed to exit in profit!
8898 2018-12-19 09:39:07 Rubbish, oil and gas workers don't take Xmas and New Year off, it's a 365, 24x7 operation, they can't get the gas out under the current regulations so will probably just leave the site to see if the government change the limits on the seismic traffic light system.

8973 2018-12-19 09:32:59 I was using it in a vape for my joint pain (I've got hypermobility and fibromyalgia) and my husband was using it for his anxiety. It was such a mild dose it didn't do much, but it tasted nicer than the oil. Stronger ones for vapes are available though, so I might try them.

9091 2018-12-19 09:18:25 Okay UK inflation data is up in a bit, We should see a sharp fall in UK producer price input numbers due to the lower oil price. There may be an impact on CPI and RPI too but I expect much more of that in the December data.

9096 2018-12-19 09:17:38 The way sanctions would affect productivity is thru reduced FDI. We assume v modest increase in prod growth btw, based on current trends. Impt 2 note: Russia’s prod growth had already started slowing down around 2009 — well before the 2014 dual oil price & sanctions shocks.

9098 2018-12-19 09:17:31 Just to let our customers know that in accordance with @10DowningStreet advice (no advice at all for SMEs) we'll be stockpiling snake oil, unicorn horns and skyhooks in case of a no-deal brexit.  Expect further updates on our Zombie Apocalypse contingency planning too.
9099 2018-12-19 09:17:29 yes. Petrochemical 3rd biggest export. GDP in Aberdeenshire way above everywhere in wales. Largest oil resources in the European Union. 173 active rigs. Two million passengers per year from 16 onshore bases. Might not be sustainable, but it's more significant than who's in govt.
9100 2018-12-19 09:17:23 잠옷이나 할래...??? 헉 식사류는 잘 못만드나요???? 그것도 귀여워ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 아 카네 일상에 시아가 자연스럽게 있는 것 같아서 너무 좋아요 어떡해ㅠㅠㅜㅠ
9101 2018-12-19 09:17:03 If we govt get out of the way and let private players compete in gas/petrol/diesel, we will far lower oil prices that we pay today. RBI and govt keep low interest rates and middle class lose purchasing power just to keep stocks and real estate prices higher. Savers are screwed.
9102 2018-12-19 09:16:48 Blair was a snake oil salesman.
9103 2018-12-19 09:16:40 #oott:  WTI supply gut started when Trump issued waivers for Iran oil.  Waivers are only for a limited time.  SA started cuts of 55Kbd to US 6 weeks ago.  Libya is still a question ?.  New cuts start from OPEC+ in 2 weeks give or take.  This drop seems manipulative.

9107 2018-12-19 09:15:55 Hope you have oil and spx analysis thanks
9108 2018-12-19 09:15:34 びっくりやで、ほんま！

9117 2018-12-19 09:14:54 Did you love the way scots were ignored and disrespected by Westminster ?
Will the EU take 92% of Scottish oil revenues for 50 years then tell scots they cant afford to be indy?
Fucking 92%
Do you think England would be happy with 8% if it had oil?
9118 2018-12-19 09:14:54 Burning the midnight oil ?
9119 2018-12-19 09:14:47 "The craziest and whitest things in the world cannot be pursued or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
9120 2018-12-19 09:14:38 How can they pay for it? US #1 oil/gas producer in the world. At $55 a barrel or less their economy will quickly collapse. That is what brought down Berlin wall and ended cold war. Russia is nothing but a gas station with nukes.
9121 2018-12-19 09:14:34 Am not getting dz story at all... If your story self was real... You got long throat.. he worked with shell, that wat enter ur head... You wan chop oil money..
9122 2018-12-19 09:14:28 No this is a power grab by Putin. Think about it. Russian exports oil and gas. Is allied with Iran and Syria. Meanwhile US becomes a net producer so Putin puts an compromised dupe in the WH. Congress is already partisan and tribal citizenry. Goodby republic. Putin owns the world.
9123 2018-12-19 09:14:21 We've been using these guys products for months now and we couldn't be happier. From Hemp proteins to full strength CBD Oil, every product has been great! @FeelSupremeCo for the win

9126 2018-12-19 09:13:31 We did find oil and gas off the coast. At the same time as Norway and in roughly the same place. We’ve just had a different legacy of exploiting it (oil companies got rich, govt oil tax went into tax cuts and general government spending, no saving for the future)
9127 2018-12-19 09:13:10 Maduro dictatorship doesn't have many allies left - you are listing Chavez' Venezuela allies. Which are also, for the most part, are either countries that export or import a lot of oil, or have been invaded, are subject to sanctions or are in a trade war with the US.
9128 2018-12-19 09:12:57 Non posso partecipare al dibattito com’è-costosa-Milano perché tutte le mie energie sono impegnate a non rispondere, a una che ha scritto “romano d’oc”, “io direi più d’oïl”. Non maramaldeggiare è faticosissimo.
9129 2018-12-19 09:12:53 Only with baby oil though :-(
9130 2018-12-19 09:12:52 Why, since you are already long oil for the Fed bounce?
9131 2018-12-19 09:12:52 @Donjazzy does your hands smell like hot oil
9132 2018-12-19 09:12:35 Brotherly Allah ya nuna mana
9133 2018-12-19 09:12:31 would be much cheaper just to invade Saudi Arabia and then divide the oil reserves up globally and equally.
9134 2018-12-19 09:12:30 No imagination,these countries still need $ of oil! In this period of time ,they need higher price! I think the oil recovery should be next few months,but if this price stay head for a long term ,many things gonna change! And it's dangerous for Lebanon as well!
9135 2018-12-19 09:12:23 It's almost as if Brexiters think that the world worships there snake oil tactics. When the rest of the world is laughing at us. Ireland is prepared instead of the landbridge route, direct to Spain route.
9136 2018-12-19 09:12:23 Data is the new oil!
9137 2018-12-19 09:12:19 Can somebody  explain  why some people  think it is okay to ask me this close to chistmas  to still accept  big commissions for the holidays  ? Like a oil painting on a big canvas ... It's  not like  oil needs weeks to dry or something  ...
9138 2018-12-19 09:12:03 You forgot to mention the deforestation for palm oil that kills orangutans, birds(that are exotic and rare) which are dropping also because of insects being destroyed poisoned for palm oil literally trees that help absorb Co2 are being decimated and most vegan foods have palm oil
9139 2018-12-19 09:11:33 parties are bought by Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Insurance, Wall Street, and the Good 'Ole NRA, both do fear mongering, and both throw a temper-tantrum when you cant get what you want (see meeting with Pelosi and Schumer). just stop being a Id10t. Doesn't make any damn sense.
9140 2018-12-19 09:11:32 yes! wash with pure soap and moisturize with coconut oil
9141 2018-12-19 09:11:25 Guys oil prices are so low. This fluctuation though<

It's $46.43 dollars/barrel now
9142 2018-12-19 09:11:23 Just Come with 5candles and 25 Litres of Vegetable Oil with a Bag of Rice to proceed with the other assignment my son!!!
Peace Unto You!!!.
9143 2018-12-19 09:11:20 Offered a position as Assistant Manager at Teluk Intan Palm Oil Estate... Hurmm... jauhnya.
9144 2018-12-19 09:11:16 The Indian rupee Tuesday rallied by a whopping 112 paise, its best single-day gains in over 5 years to settle at 70.44 against the US dollar as softening crude oil prices eased concern over India’s current account deficit expansion.

9147 2018-12-19 09:10:37 I pledge to Mamador healthy tasty club, to ensure usage of Mamador oil through out the festive season and always.

9150 2018-12-19 09:10:01 humans may be about to show #Darwin was right, as we are the smartest, but because of greed & pride we are not the best at change & even with dire warnings & evidence of #climatechange we are still drilling for oil...
9151 2018-12-19 09:09:58 Please visit Andaman or atleast read Majhi Janmathep before talking of a man who spent 23years of his youth in jail for this motherland. If this also cant happen, I challenge u to manually ground a coconut and remove 20kgs oil from it daily.
9152 2018-12-19 09:09:35 All the people who’ve ever lived (110 billion) weigh less than than the plastics we’ve produced in the last 50 years. #RedefiningSingleUse But we only turn 5% of oil and gas into plastic and have burned the rest to produce 60 times as much CO2
9153 2018-12-19 09:09:35 @divyaspandana 

Let Samosa and Pakoda first fight it out amongst them for 2019 PM post, some oil (energy) will automatically get reduced.
9154 2018-12-19 09:09:19 How the value of money decreases Tax relaxation increases , even in modi tenure petrol price reached to 84 even if crude oil price is less than 60$ , in UPA crude oil was 125-135$ . Don't mislead , change strategy to come into power .
9155 2018-12-19 09:08:57 Nanna pissed because I haven’t come to change my oil yet i’m a month late NANNA I WANNA GAME
9156 2018-12-19 09:08:42 En fait il s'agit de différencier les pick-up utilitaires, utilisés par des pros pour transporter du matériel et ceux qui ne le sont pas (utilisés par des particuliers sans payer la fiscalité)

9159 2018-12-19 09:07:33 Recent rules made to cool housing in BC and Ont were blanket applied, hitting Alberta just as oil dropped & recession set in. The effect on Alberta was an after thought not considered. This type of thing happens all the time.
9160 2018-12-19 09:07:30 biore oil cleanser?
9161 2018-12-19 09:06:54 for medicinal purposes and for making your own ethanol is by far better choice- it dissolves both water and oil soluble chemicals found in the plant while carbon dioxide can only dissolve the oil-soluble chemicals.
you can use (medical) ether,naphta/benzine to get even better oil
9162 2018-12-19 09:06:38 I pledge to my heart my love
To be faithful and loyal
In my choice of Oils
To always choose the best 
And healthy oil
To ensure I never lack Mamador Oil in my kitchen
To ensure I always cook with Mamador Oil
So help me God, Amen. #MamadorHealthyTastyClub

9164 2018-12-19 09:05:57 The most heart wrenching thing about the Abule Egba fire outbreak caused by pipeline vandalism through oil bunkering is that they have put many small-scale business out of business because most of the shops affected are owned by these people. God help us in this country
9165 2018-12-19 09:05:20 So its custom for government offices to give out bags of rice and cartons of oil to civil servants. How considerate. But then, the directors(basically any one with high grade level) takes about 12 and above cartons of oil home while junior staff takes 1 carton

9168 2018-12-19 09:05:09 Oil/gas want to drill for energy. I've written several and suggested that they convert old oil wells into geothermal power, esp when drilling with multiple wells into a seam. Should also push for geo in Yellowstone edge like NASA suggest. This is certain money.

9176 2018-12-19 09:03:19 Just learned how to change my own oil 
9177 2018-12-19 09:02:36 I have a question!! If Maduro the boss of Venezuela was such a bad guy, why would he not simply make DASH illegal?! Why has this "bad" guy been the first one world wide to officially say f*CK the United States of Fascism and is selling his oil for crypto instead of USD?!

9179 2018-12-19 09:01:52 Oil is the lifeblood of your car engine. Because there are so many moving, rotating parts in there, your engine has to be well lubricated. As you drive around, though, your oil starts to degrade, whilst some gets burnt off in the engine
9180 2018-12-19 09:01:50 そうなんですよね。そのあたりは実際の性能差はともかく出光やJXのエクスターFとの明確な差にはなりますね。今はGTLな新キヤッスルがあるので純正としてそこまでの特徴とも言えなくなったのが残念な所で。キヤッスルでは放置された5w-30にも配合している点は良いのですが、配合としては中途半端な感も

9213 2018-12-19 08:57:56 I mean, sure, but the oil angle is hardly the biggest one here. Brownlee is openly saying it's okay to spy on opposition parties with no warrants and no evidence of law-breaking and that the report is "blowing this whole thing out of proportion."

9220 2018-12-19 08:57:22 Dear Modiji. Issue oil bonds to oil companies, buy crude from Iran on credit. Provide petrol and diesel at 20/- litres. We, the common indians don't bother even if India become bankrupt like Pakistan.
9221 2018-12-19 08:56:55 Thank you for addressing this issue. I awoke at 2am with a powerful overwhelming question “what if it’s all true?”  Then it’s an indictment of capitalism. DJT is a Putin patsy and Russian now has complete control of the world’s oil supply. Step 1 complete. What’s step 2?

9228 2018-12-19 08:54:58 I was labour 30 years,and have two questions for you.
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we have had for 50 years?

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
Are yer politics strong enough to answer honestly?

9675 2018-12-19 07:53:11 Eastern Canada needs oil and can’t get it from western Canada so they must source from other countries. Canadian companies can’t get  government approval to build pipelines to ship Canadian oil east. Government of Canada is the problem
9676 2018-12-19 07:52:55 Populist policies, over-spending, borrowing too much money, corruption.

9736 2018-12-19 07:43:21 Since there is no pipeline capacity, Irving couldn’t use western Canada oil if it wanted to.
9737 2018-12-19 07:43:15 the fact that oil can be seen makes it at least somewhat traceable to see who is filling up the North Korean tankers offshore. with data brokers nobody really knows how it is used.

9764 2018-12-19 07:39:07 Many on LA City Council take money from Chevron. They SHOUlD at a minimum start by banning extraction within 2500 feet of schools and housing. Then follow up by shutting the rest down. Instead they just throw out empty threats of suing the oil companies for climate change.

9773 2018-12-19 07:37:17 My tip for smaller 2 / engines like strimmers, is when you've finished using it, to drain all the fuel out and run it until it stops. Otherwise petrol evaporates, altering fuel oil ratio, causing poor starting. I do this every time I use them.

Olive oil is actually healthy & so good as long as +
9806 2018-12-19 07:32:20 Thanks. It maybe loro-nostro transactions in INR so SWIFT is avoidable. Physically they will receive oil but will not pay until better times. Iran will be able to do shopping in India though :) just my opinion
9807 2018-12-19 07:32:19 We have most of the fish stocks, renewables , oil etc.

9813 2018-12-19 07:31:32 Oil subsidy scam? Jonathan was paying subsidy with pump price of #87, today Buhari is paying same subsidy he called scam with #145 pump price so who is the scam between them?

9818 2018-12-19 07:31:13 Yes, Gill, I've heard there is worse, like bunker oil used for ships. My bottom line is to have Canada and USA commit to renewable resources and seriously develop our energy sector with wind and solar power, developing electric vehicles (VW, Volvo, Toyota, Tesla and GM).

9846 2018-12-19 07:27:14 The coverage also reproduces a stereotype of Albertans as a homogeneous mob of rednecks who fawn over oil companies and don't believe in climate change. A lot of us are actually desperate for meaningful govt action to reduce GHGs and to build a post-carbon economy.

9858 2018-12-19 07:25:16 I know nothing will change....  Leaders of the past have "sold off" our rights to our resources (oil and gas / water) and now private industry runs the show.  Nestle takes our water, BigOil controls fossil fuels..  We have no control anymore

Simples
9880 2018-12-19 07:21:48 I think perhaps where you miss the point is this.  The liberals don’t want to shut down oil and gas in Alberta. They want to shut down the oilsands. This is the supposed “dirty oil”.

9888 2018-12-19 07:19:59 Right? The manager was still right nearby to put out the fire. Apparently the oven shorted out somehow? Possibly in combo with them testing the oven without looking inside to see that that's where they were storing cooking oil? Maybe leaving it on? Mysteries.

9892 2018-12-19 07:19:25 I think all those countries in the middle east (Iraq, Kuwait), where we spent so much BLOOD and treasure, should kick in.  The Saudis, Qataris, Omanis, and others have profited from oil sales under the protection of US Naval and land forces.

9905 2018-12-19 07:18:08  I want to throw some oil on that fire by saying that Hamilton is a step up from Napier. But it’s really not.
9906 2018-12-19 07:18:02 OMFG this is awesome. It looks great - the colors/shading, the general composition and mood... Wow. (Idk if it's weird for me to be in awe of people making beautiful art with oil paint in this day and age when I feel like few people use it? But I am)
9907 2018-12-19 07:17:35 That's amusing. We have much lower quality oil which is way more costly to extract. No equivalency whatsoever.
