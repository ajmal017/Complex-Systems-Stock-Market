2 2018-11-15 23:46:14 How come team owners own billions of dollars but are never considered “greedy” when they don’t want to pay 1 of their top commodities. If you were a high producer at your company and asked to be paid a certain amount, only to give you so much, you’re gonna consider leaving right?
3 2018-11-15 23:22:40 Under classical Stalinism, there is no production of commodities. Goods supplied to the military & police are produced for use. In the rest of the economy, production is an act of compliance with the plan. It is a ritual of obedience, unrelated either to profitability or use. 2/2

They do. Pharma priced out of reach of many citizens. And cited by Doctors Without Borders reason for axing TPP, as it'd kill many a Vietnamese.

38 2018-11-15 22:11:48 I’m an MBA and business consultant by training. Capacity utilization is not a measure meant for humans. It comes from commodities optimization. It is not meant for humans. Architecture Institute recommends around 70% for schools. (Need to search my old tweets on this.)
39 2018-11-15 22:09:08 It certainly is. Lots of good people grow grain, but they all take the dole and they all support the import bans and tarrifs against foreign commodities.  They are bought and sold politically based on the Farm Bill
40 2018-11-15 22:02:19 Rubbish, this country cannot support itself,unless all commodities increase in price.
41 2018-11-15 22:00:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
42 2018-11-15 21:57:04 Si, dependíamos de commodities y sus precios históricos
43 2018-11-15 21:50:18 Gold. Oil. Soy. Corn. Commodities all provided by the market. You may want to regulated the market more than me, but I assume you don't think gov't should provide these things?
44 2018-11-15 21:47:12 At first, what plunged the Nation into deep hike in prices of commodities was to allow fully the forces of demand and supply to run its cause. The present administration has since turned away from such economic view. Sadly, that is what the PDP is bringing to the table.
45 2018-11-15 21:46:59 Commodities are collapsing.
I don’t see it.
Where do you see it?
46 2018-11-15 21:44:36 Got the ducking job! Moving to Indonesia to sell stocks, investments, commodities, forex and bonds to wealthy business people! Everything paid for by the company! Can not wait to start this new adventure, 2019 will be a good year
47 2018-11-15 21:39:37 Fiat currencies such as the Euro are a big factor in financial crises. Currencies need to be backed by gold, Bitcoin or other commodities. Otherwise, they are useless. The Euro is backed by nothing.
48 2018-11-15 21:13:12 And the prices for basic commodities are still up there
49 2018-11-15 21:06:52 Atikulooter wouldn't mind if prices of basic commodities hit the rooftop

52 2018-11-15 20:52:29 Recent turmoil in the two commodities was likely due to a massive bearish positions in gas offset by longs in crude oil and "the unwinding of positions in one of these two commodities could potentially have triggered the opposite effect on the other commodity," Citigroup
53 2018-11-15 20:43:43 The war on drugs is a decrepit facade, the capitalist state wants you to get high on commodities.
54 2018-11-15 20:41:15 Commodities have been discussed as a solution - underperformed during the financial asset inflate, but these markets are having hard times too.
55 2018-11-15 20:33:38 Mas é evidente que tem de mudar. Mudar custa dinheiro e leva tempo. O projeto do Levy para o BNDES faz *todo* sentido. Investir em inovação tecnológica e diminuição do Estado. Comprar briga com quem compra commodities, hoje, faz zero sentido pois precisamos do $.
56 2018-11-15 20:31:05 What responsibility? This leaves the implication that women’s bodies are commodities up for sale and we need to be honest in our advertising. 
Fuck that. 
Our bodies and photos of them are ours to do with as we please, zero responsibility beyond making ourselves happy.
57 2018-11-15 20:28:13 You are basically asking me to help demarket APC and market PDP, so its not about education!

I already did the education part, prices of commodities can go up or down depending on market forces! Basic economics...

Still, DM is open!
58 2018-11-15 20:26:27 Your motivation to succeed and your time on earth are the most precious commodities: bad friendships and companions waste both. It is by far better to be alone than being surrounded by negative / envious people. 
59 2018-11-15 20:26:06 Good if your buying any commodities
60 2018-11-15 20:22:11 Broke: treating customers & clients like commodities and always looking for the next one.

61 2018-11-15 20:14:24 You make a good point. But then what about my rights to life liberty and property? Are they just commodities of the free market only to be accessible through currency? Do you believe an anarchist society can fend off an organized state?
62 2018-11-15 20:12:24 Yup, Euro area is biggest importer of energy. Note how it is now more stable vis-a-vis commodities, gold, oil... For Oils a huge incentive to switch would there be way how they could park their surplus in Euros.
China does it via investment now.

80 2018-11-15 19:28:44 Sure. But even in commodities you find very different returns this year. Similar to active managers. Nothing worked ‚on average‘ but some few did. I‘d definitely say 2018 has not been a year for making easy money.
81 2018-11-15 19:25:46 No, I'm in agreement that real rates are headed back down as economy slows and inflation ebbs (at least the way we measure it.)  Energy costs (including materials -tires) are a large part of mining and these costs have dropped with commodities in general.

83 2018-11-15 19:05:51 For perspective, financial assets have had a really good run for years. Both stocks and bonds are fin'l assets. So maybe its time for other assets to have a good run. Maybe commodities, maybe labor assets (wages) -- both are inflation btw; maybe something else

89 2018-11-15 18:35:17 There’s a girl in my class who just pronounced the word “commodities” as “comedys” and I’m legit disappointed, but not really because nobody made her read as a child so it’s not her fault.
90 2018-11-15 18:26:02 I suggest, govt should stop immediately trading of Agri  commodities like rice, sugar, oil, ghee, grains etc. And all other basic items like cotton, chilli, chana, pulses etc.
As trading these items brings more volatility and manipulation in their prices.

These digital commodities are produced by large numbers of INFLUENCERS generating a criticalmass of information/data. These INFLUENCERS can then accumulate, own, transfer, sell, trade or even use these assets as currency, benefiting from the usual guarantees

106 2018-11-15 17:46:00 Also you seem to define "being an expert" as "being able to bag a desired lay" which I also reject outright.  Sort your own thoughts out clearly before you pontificate next time and maybe try treating people like people instead of commodities.

108 2018-11-15 17:34:27 Let’s talk about policies that would make a difference for the market woman. Subsidizing transport fare for goods to and fro the market, especially agricultural produce fresh from the market. It will greatly impact the price of commodities and reduce cost prices.
109 2018-11-15 17:29:10 Mostly undifferentiated commodities (like meat or oil) compete mostly on price, and slightly on quality. The only way lab meat "takes over" is if it becomes cheaper while offering the same or better quality, and thus making factory farms obsolete. Economics.
110 2018-11-15 17:25:02 We are the children of fear, ours is a paranoid generation. We fear being left behind what others have left. We are the commodity of commodities. We are the consuming consumers. This frenzy of devouring our ownself will crumble us to dust.

113 2018-11-15 17:14:03 Everybody's saying get short.  The only shorts are the banks because central banks are pulling liquidity.  Equities (except financials) will be fine.  In fact, equities and commodities are the only game in town unless you want 2% interest.  LOL.

122 2018-11-15 16:46:09 X86 computing is a commodity. The method in which you provide that commodity involves a combination of commodities and differentiated components.

127 2018-11-15 16:32:05 Agreed. But it shouldn't be this way. We've become human commodities.
128 2018-11-15 16:31:46 We don't need higher wages. We need you to control the Fed and lower inflation & cut prices on commodities and services.

My sense is that many of these trafficking/smuggling problems—human, drugs & arms, contraband commodities like animal parts, wild animals &c—are tightly linked.

149 2018-11-15 14:54:22 As long as animals are seen as commodities, instead of as individuals, abuse is inevitable. Supply and demand. The less demand there is for things derived from animals, the fewer animals have to be killed.

159 2018-11-15 14:06:21 Ever wonder why poverty, and Youth unemployment in Africa never get solved? 

Well, because they are commodities to a few smart people who are able to generate an emotional story around either and get money, and sometimes lots of money to get themselves out of poverty.

215 2018-11-15 09:35:59 Interesting you’d say that, since it’s clear that data can be bought and sold. Data are therefore commodities which can be traded, thereby making them capable of being the subject/matter or ownership. Check the GDPR, for eg., and its use of possessive pronouns regarding data.

228 2018-11-15 08:15:13 Oil prices continued to fall on Thursday as data revealed crude inventories have been rising more than expected. Gold prices inched up while the dollar slipped.

231 2018-11-15 08:10:49 Well hooray for the animals who rarely get treated as anything but disposable commodities to be neglected & cruelly treated. Our Govt still treating both animals & humans abysmally. Now join us all in lobbying for humans on other threads.
232 2018-11-15 07:58:13 also on continuous contracts on commodities , the long term drift is towards the downside , so a price down volume up fuels more down side ( but again this is due to the fact that the  long term down ward drift on most commodities is downwards)
233 2018-11-15 07:55:38 indices and bonds as well to certain extent are mean reverting , where as commodities are trending ..
234 2018-11-15 07:53:35 Nice confirming what I have seen for years. I do wonder if there are some markets where it is true. Perhaps certain commodities

237 2018-11-15 07:15:26 These fuel hikes are going to really mess prices of all commodities.  NPF repucations...the biggest NPF Fund heist...
238 2018-11-15 07:05:14 We also need to learn to go by the authentic products in the market unlike being enticed by cheap prices of fake commodities
239 2018-11-15 07:02:29 Fuel prices went up. Soon other commodities tlabo di oketswa le tsone. Mme salary le minimum wage dieme hela disa tshikinyege.
240 2018-11-15 07:00:26 Because basic human comforts such as heat, electricity & water have been made into commodities. Capitalism monetizes everything. People shouldn't die because they can't pay for heat. There needs to be  a balance between necessities & luxuries.
241 2018-11-15 06:56:27 Coffee not originally Bharatiya. Started by the British. Reasons :
1) Large forests being "unproductive"
2) Commodities demand in European markets
3) Revenue source for them and
4) To control misuse of forest by local people as in shifting cultivation

Same applies to tea !!! :-)

246 2018-11-15 06:18:37 Believes we are in an economic bubble. When that bubble pops he believes all the money is going into commodities. Hopefully he holds a few bitcoin at these LOWs. believe that trillions of dollars (if not all of them) are going to dump into #bitcoin
247 2018-11-15 06:02:12 Replying 2 a seemingly bearish interviewer, Elizabeth Gaines, Fortescue Metals CE: we see very robust & strong conditions in China from talking 2 customers & signed MOUs with em.

While MOUs aren’t actual orders, they’re a +ve signal.

249 2018-11-15 05:52:54 That's how they sell the world. In Africa, there's very little trade within the continent yet even very basic commodities are imported

254 2018-11-15 05:03:19 You're doing it! My TKer comes home talking about needs/wants & commodities/services. She reminds us of how fortunate we are to have our needs met & to have so many of our wants. The financial literacy curriculum @RiosRobots gives my DD the language to step away from entitlement.

256 2018-11-15 04:52:18 @eikebatista preços para as commodities exportadas que continuam cruciais para a economia brasileira. Segundo, o consumo privado interno também despencou, talvez por conta de um acúmulo excessivo de dívidas. Terceiro, a política econômica, em lugar de combater a desaceleração, /2
257 2018-11-15 04:34:16 will it feed hungry filiupinos??..will it lower  prices of basic commodities...
258 2018-11-15 04:29:09 Boomer, have you gone senile? You clearly missed the point. These are things that you have used and have taken advantage of your whole life. You can break the contract at any time! By using these said publicly funded commodities you agreed to this implicit deal.
259 2018-11-15 04:28:14 Tax revenue Increased still the prices of common commodities sky rocketed. Still no healthcare plan. Still schools colleges hospitals are missing. Only names are being changed and statues are being erected.
260 2018-11-15 04:22:07 Dgaz is an ETN that does do not represent an investment in physical commodities. Each series of ETNs is linked to the underlying index as described in the applicable pricing supplement. Each applicable underlying index is comprised of futures contracts on a single commodity.
261 2018-11-15 04:19:16 The advertisement industry infuses messages so people can consume goods with the hope that these items will achieve the needs and wants of their desire. The resources society use today are draining our plant in order to supply commodities that we sometimes don’t need. #HK456_W8

266 2018-11-15 03:03:39 Never looked at USDterms. Based on price going below 4181 bot a few contracts. After a very long time dipping my fingers into international commodities.First trades since Brexit days.
267 2018-11-15 03:03:17 Maybe not a bad idea...and put your $$ into commodities so they can't zap you with the FED.
268 2018-11-15 03:01:03 E porque não aproveitou a alta das commodities...

274 2018-11-15 02:20:10 A day of such negativity.
Let's end on a positive note.

275 2018-11-15 02:08:56 en Brasil, sin embargo; y después de sacar a la gorda dilma, se acabó el modelo Popu PT del dólar bajo y decidieron bajar la tasa de interés real -con ello el dólar más alto ayudó a paliar la baja de commodities del Agro. Bergara y Astori se creen aún una isla de la fantasía.
276 2018-11-15 01:50:46 No, not necessarily but it means that the exchange is attempting to put the breaks on violent movements, creating pauses. Equities markets do this too in a different format. All commodities have these pauses because hard limits are market distorting.
277 2018-11-15 01:42:06 O Brasil não é uma potência não porque mal aproveitou uma alta muito breve nas commodities, mas pelo sucateamento da infraestrutura e da industria desde o Império.
278 2018-11-15 01:37:12 Cuba será sempre atacada pela direita, ninguém questiona a China, tem um regime comunista, com questionável economia de mercado, porém consome muitas Commodities dos países capitalistas, inclusive o Brasil.
279 2018-11-15 01:31:09 Também é inegável que na época do governo Lula o Brasil só ficou na 6 melhor economia do mundo graças às COMMODITIES. Inclusive muitos especialistas dizem que hoje só não somos uma potência devido à tomada de decisão econômica  referente ao governo PT nessa época.

281 2018-11-15 01:24:23 its interest rates you stupid sonofabitch, and i'll use bonds, currencies and commodities to backup my point.......

but that doesnt even matter: all that matters is the scoreboard...... and it says I'M WINNING
282 2018-11-15 01:20:59 Prestenção, @marinasilva Os médicos cubanos eram tratados por Cuba como commodities. Vai cair o PIB de Cuba ao se retirar do programa. Mas viu que eles não  permitem que as famílias venham?
283 2018-11-15 01:17:32 Até onde sei, os médicos cubanos eram tratados como commodities pelo governo de Cuba. Vai ser um baque no pib da ilhota
284 2018-11-15 01:16:51 Commodities price crash and competion of LNG certainly explains the PNG graph, but the one Wes refers to is for Pacific excl PNG. While Aust exports to the region have stagnated, the sharp decline in 2013-15 is largely an exchange rate story
285 2018-11-15 01:16:23 Ouvi há pouco uma definição excelente do jornalista Diego Casagrande, relacionada aos "médicos" cubanos no Brasil.

Ele disse que essas pessoas são como um tipo de "commodities internacional" para sustentar a ditadura cubana.

É isso.
286 2018-11-15 01:10:52 Gains... Also, they r reacting to positive comments about US/ China trade talks... * commodities: oil, losing stock, wage on reward... then, output from group and Russia offset losses from Iran sanctions... * UTI cond, US market: $55 per barrel, falling 7%
287 2018-11-15 01:08:46 Sua análise macroeconômica é falha demais. Grécia quebrou por causa da UE. Brasil cresceu sim em decorrência da explosão do preço das commodities. O que a Dilma fez foi um governo desastroso e neoliberal. Só olhar as estratégias. Mesma coisa do Paulo Guedes

290 2018-11-15 00:20:56 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.
291 2018-11-15 00:20:20 Copy paste designs are pretty easy to implement and scale out in 3 years. Commodities are really easy to copy paste designs on.
292 2018-11-15 00:12:42 Have you seen Jon Grudens draft history? My point is simple; they HAD Mack, a once in a generation talent who can potentially singlehandedly take over a football gm. Why draft and develop a talent like that to trade him for some unknown commodities. Seems backwards to me.
