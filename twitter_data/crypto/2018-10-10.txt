6 2018-10-10 23:58:55 I was able to roll over 100% of my $40K+ 401K. Had my 401K been larger there wouldn't have been limits. I also did a Roth conversion to take the tax hit now rather than later. Once it's set up you can buy #Crypto, stocks, real estate, & other assets. My holdings are 100% #Bitcoin

9 2018-10-10 23:58:28 More #FUD to use crypto to hedge against the stock market.
10 2018-10-10 23:58:27 I think there might be a nice enough locality preserving ) sensitive hash function family, such that if proteins p, q are "equivalent," then their hashes are the same or "close." 

But this is the antipode of crypto hashes which try to never have such pretty features, so good pt.

18 2018-10-10 23:56:47 自分はBTCでも稼げてなかったのでえちしょーさんとは全然気持ちが違うとは思いますが、瞬間的に髭作ったりしないんで全然違いますよね
19 2018-10-10 23:56:46 And you wonder why you guys are the laughing stock of crypto?

Time to wake up and smell the coffee.
