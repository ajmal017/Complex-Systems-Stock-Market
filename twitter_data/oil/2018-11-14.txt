35 2018-11-14 23:57:34 The United States has chosen the wrong path in reimposing sanctions on Iran and will be defeated, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday, according to the Tasnim news agency

40 2018-11-14 23:56:45 (・д・)チッ
41 2018-11-14 23:56:29 Why would they? Forced to join the Eu, Wales has already been turned in to one of the 5 poorest countries in Europe. Scotland’s oil already has the elites all over it and Ireland is a false flag.
42 2018-11-14 23:56:23 I personally can’t wait to see what the duplicitous POS cooks up to line his pockets post senate...why would I not be surprised if pulled an Al Whore...I meant Gore and started to peddle swamp subsidized snake oil
43 2018-11-14 23:56:19 @DavidEvennett i trust you are burning the midnight oil reading all 585pages of the withdrawal agreement. I look forward to learning how you intend to vote #StopBrexit
44 2018-11-14 23:56:11 When you use cannabis oil there are different types. There is THC, CBD or 1:1. Do a little reading
45 2018-11-14 23:56:07 And until oil price / royalty income recovers, there’s not likely to be any.
46 2018-11-14 23:56:04 My dad needs to take my truck to get an oil change because I am too lazy to do it 
47 2018-11-14 23:56:00 Every 3 weeks we do enough kilometres to circle the globe and avoid burning over 5000L of petrol. 

If we do that imagine how much fuel the entire Tesla fleet avoids let alone all the electric vehicles throughout the world. Peak ground transport oil has definitely been passed.
48 2018-11-14 23:55:50 Tick tock humanity. Fights over oil isn't as bad as what fights over food will look like.
49 2018-11-14 23:55:21 my baby has been napping for 2 hours and that allowed me to whiten my teeth, do a face mask, workout for 30 min, pluck my eyebrows, AND condition my hair with oil. BLESS UP :,) exactly what i needed.
50 2018-11-14 23:55:12 If data is the new oil, then knowing how to refine it into actionable intelligence is the key to unleashing its potential. To this end, CIOs are playing with predictive analytics, crafting machine learning algorithms and battle-testing analytics solutions in pursuit of busin…

52 2018-11-14 23:54:55 You talk about ending a “culture of corruption”, yet you stand with Al Sharpton? Why do Black people continue to latch on to false prophets, opportunists, and snake oil salesmen? Al Charlatan is a crime against humanity and so are you. I’m glad I wasn’t raised in the “Hive”.
53 2018-11-14 23:54:54 I remember a few yrs back T Bone Pickens was on CNBC when oil was first dropping a lot and he was very confident it would bounce back near a hundred by year end. He said if it didn't he was gonna lose a lot of money. It didn't.
54 2018-11-14 23:54:43 Serious question.  Have you considered CDB oil (cannabidiol)?
55 2018-11-14 23:54:34 55555
56 2018-11-14 23:54:26 If useful & economical solutions do appear at some point, THEN we can consider them. The oil's not going anywhere.
57 2018-11-14 23:54:23 It's better than Coconut Oil. Yes!
58 2018-11-14 23:54:22 Cannabis!!!! Cannabis oil is made for dogs to. And use topical. It is showing amazing results. I’m so sorry . My puppy’s are like my kids ..

61 2018-11-14 23:54:15 Cheap Oil puts a lot of voters Texas, Dakotas, Lousiana, Oklahoma, Alaska, etc out of work.  Bad news with 2020 on the horizon.

64 2018-11-14 23:53:45 imagine all of those 18 wheelers and trains and ships being electric and powered by renewable resources

wait, then you don't need oil anymore...
65 2018-11-14 23:53:44 And the 2 years since? You brag about  imperial oil yet about $60b in O&G fdi has been sold off since you persons took power last time I checked. For example, the $36b fron petronas far outweighs this week's news.
66 2018-11-14 23:53:40 That's an awesome idea! Changing a tire is a must. My father wouldn't let me get my license until I could change a tire and the oil. Self defense is a great confidence builder.

74 2018-11-14 23:52:50 In other words, gullible people believed the snake oil salesman and voted for something that doesn't exist, an illusion, and you wonder why we think Brexits are idiots
75 2018-11-14 23:52:47 get a cat, mine used to sit on me when i had MANstrual cramps and it helped SO much, also peppermint essential oil on the waistline might help

It sounds like engine oil.

78 2018-11-14 23:52:04 for the cold I recommend drinking a little apple cider vinegar with warm water & local honey, and if your throat hurts you should do a gargle of this w/ coconut oil

85 2018-11-14 23:51:03 800 words is all I'm going to get on this beast today. I'm gonna go have some fresh bread and olive oil, and think about things.
86 2018-11-14 23:51:01 I got Van Van oil all over my hands. Bet no mosquitos would fuck with me though  I was just tryna get to my bentonite clay to put on my damn face
87 2018-11-14 23:50:48 my face get so dry in the winter, I be about to slap vegetable oil on my shit tf.
88 2018-11-14 23:50:43 My question is what will happen with US tight oil production with rising gasoline inventories/ & -cracks, Dec., Jan. & Feb., are all "build" months and they are at a historical high just like tight oil.  Has to cut back/flat, crash, or miracle rise in exports, maybe to China...
89 2018-11-14 23:50:30 Olive Oil...

今月のoilはスペシャル月ですかねw
92 2018-11-14 23:50:04 Because all Albertans are unsure of their job, home, oil and gas industry, health care and education.
93 2018-11-14 23:49:56 went to look at a car that was "in my budget" found out i looked at prices wrong. Matthew found me one in my budget and had it fixed up with an oil change too. So helpful. thanks Matthew
94 2018-11-14 23:49:50 Try Nuleaf! It's not only CBD isolate in their oil, but whole plant hemp oil so you get all the terpenes, and other cannabinoids with the CBD. Creates an entourage effect that is even better than just CBD!
95 2018-11-14 23:49:44 This black castor oil has my beard feeling so soft
96 2018-11-14 23:49:41 I Need My Oil Changed My Shit Sound Like Ah Bus 
97 2018-11-14 23:49:39 The problem with palm oil is that its in so much processed food, not just confectionary but lots of bread & crackers too. It takes time to find alternatives but that is what companies must do!

99 2018-11-14 23:49:32 So uninformed! The NDP does not set the world oil price.
I hope you can understand and accept that the price is due to supply and demand! And, you’re welcome!
100 2018-11-14 23:49:30 I fail to understand why news stations go to this failed lobbyist. He’s never accurate (138.9 2 days ago) and gives estimates that land within the daily 5-10 cent fluctuation. average price has been artificially inflated for last 5 years and is far out of conjunction with oil.
101 2018-11-14 23:49:22 ...before you drive in... quick check on all lights, indicators, rear number plate light, wiper blades, tyres and brakes! Check the oil level then... Let your car cool down 30 mins prior to dropping it off (park up and do some shopping!)... helps with emissions!  good luck!

104 2018-11-14 23:49:12 A few treatments for ear mites may be used on all family pets in the home safely.

One well known brand name is Dr Dogs Ear Oil. This is all natural and it will eliminate [keyword] efficiently and safely. It has no dangerous chemicals or pesticides and it has natural antibiotic
105 2018-11-14 23:49:07 Blessing in disguise, Oil price, traded in Dollar, a cyclical nature now turn falling. The logic of as it goes up, NOT BENEFITING USDIDR, when Oil down, it somehow relax the Current Account Defisit. At least for the Q4 projection.
106 2018-11-14 23:48:59 Did he say anything about oil? Hard to have high inflation with plummeting oil prices
107 2018-11-14 23:48:55 castor oil can heal anything
108 2018-11-14 23:48:51 Yes try using castor oil too
109 2018-11-14 23:48:49 Habrá el suficiente fuel oil 4 para volver a la generación térmica ? Por que todo se llevan a China 
110 2018-11-14 23:48:47 No that’s true for me too. I REALLY stay away from lost indica doms unless it’s in oil but even then- just gives me a real shitty high. I tend to get panic attacks depending on how I feel :(
111 2018-11-14 23:48:40 Now the international community realizes that Maduro is a threat because there is no more money and oil to give away to “friends, or because Maduro is dumber than Chavez and he is easily manipulated by Cuba and Russia? Or because his other obscure alliances in the Middle East?
112 2018-11-14 23:48:37 Try oil funds now
113 2018-11-14 23:48:21 I'mma let it be known

115 2018-11-14 23:47:57 I will not line the products of a quack snake oil salesman. There is no autism epidemic. Folk with autism aren’t  a disease. How fucking dare you claim that.

Effective Friday Nov 16 CME Crude #oil non-member initial margin will increase by 14.5%.
117 2018-11-14 23:47:52 No need of assuring Nigerians of sticking to your words since OBJ has forgiven you. You'll eat your words like Yam without palm oil when you're defeated!
118 2018-11-14 23:47:46 Took car to a dealer to get something hanging off the bottom snapped back on & an oil change. Took 4 hours. Next morning, thing still hanging. Took it back; they said that I’d only asked for an oil change. I asked if part of their 50 point inspection was “looking under the car.”
119 2018-11-14 23:47:33 You can’t feed people bombs nor oil. Yemen is starving to death!
120 2018-11-14 23:47:28 My mom and aunt love Josie Maran whipped argan face cream and it is really nice (& my aunt also used to be an Oil of Olay devote)
121 2018-11-14 23:47:17 ReTHUG witch hunt again....along with blaming LBJ for JFK killing when it was Dulles, Bush, et al, Big Oil, CIA w/Mob connections & Dallas connections. Oh &4 good measure throw Clinton in there. Does anyone think Lewinsky the assh*le is getting paid by GOPigs? I do.
122 2018-11-14 23:47:10 Not only did they not do it, they voted to start taking money from Big Oil again. They are bought and paid for.
123 2018-11-14 23:47:00 What's on your mind?
“A lot of them haven ’ t been to school and they are claiming , you know, that Nigeria has been an oil producing country therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing , health care , education , free , ” said Buhari .

128 2018-11-14 23:46:18 when you’re in the shower exfoliate with exfoliating gloves and soap then when you’re done use oil blotting sheets and oil removing wipes to get rid of extra oil (one in the morning and at night) then use pimple cream on affected areas and your t-zone 
(neutrogena is rly good)

136 2018-11-14 23:45:26 You still haven't answered any questions about what you're doing with your homophobic party members, or how you plan to make the oil companies clean up after themselves. I suspect that would be a huge advantage for Albertans.
137 2018-11-14 23:45:10 On a completed unrelated note. Neo Soul hoes are the best type of hoes. Yes she might cheat on you but your scalp getting rubbed with oil. You wake up to lekka smelling incense and let's not forget the kamasutra style bapsing
138 2018-11-14 23:45:02 funny thing is was there a recollision!   
Before  signatory Paris climate  accord  oil price  hit rock  bottom sometime below $30 - funny  how it skyrocket thereafter   the agreement  came into force -this  continues  to baffle  my brain- oil prices should neverbe thishigh

140 2018-11-14 23:44:52 Not if Democrats can kill Oil and Gas.......Dem voters are dumber than dirt.
141 2018-11-14 23:44:42 Me too. And judging by the price of oil I think it will go down more. There are 10 stations selling for less than $2 a gallon!
142 2018-11-14 23:44:34 Aim for baking your meat instead of frying it

Unnecessary additional calories derived from the oil
143 2018-11-14 23:44:11 How much is that gonna cost. Will I get a bottle of holy oil with that??
144 2018-11-14 23:44:11 well since it’s an oil, it doesn’t penetrate your skin like a moisturizer is supposed to so it sits on top, clogging your pores, causing more breakouts, and drying ur skin out even more which is t r a s h so ppl with oily/ acne prone skin should prob not b using it tbh
145 2018-11-14 23:44:10 City are small time with a random corrupt influx of oil money. What would you be without it let's be honest.
146 2018-11-14 23:44:03 It doesn't surprise me...@MichelleObama probably cooked it with soy cheese and coconut oil.  #lovemesomeMichelle 
147 2018-11-14 23:43:53 , new foods are always a bit scary. I make an avocado salad with tomatoes and red onion, just toss with lime juice and olive oil. Avocados are a fav over here

152 2018-11-14 23:42:59 Part of my thesis on rate hikes has been oil and inflation. Oil has given Powell the opportunity to pause, and given the recent rhetoric, he may seize the opportunity. My base case now is a hike in December with more dovish language.

154 2018-11-14 23:42:55 Me: since when do you care about the environment?
Tucker: since I saw the devestation of Becky.
Me: when was that?
Tucker: 93-94ish...whenever they drilled for oil at bayside. 
Me: is Becky the duck on saved by the bell?
Tucker: yeah obviously.
155 2018-11-14 23:42:53 You can buy cbd tablets from Holland & Barrett, I buy the oil from a vape shop they sell the gummies too
156 2018-11-14 23:42:46 Why don’t you use your great negotiation skills and force them to lower oil prices or is that FAKE too.
157 2018-11-14 23:42:25 We'll accept an oil painting rendition.
158 2018-11-14 23:42:21 Socialism will destroy the US
...assuming we peg our currency to another that we don’t control (Venezuela’s is pegged to the $) and when the price of our most economically vital resource is controlled by foreign governments (price of oil is controlled by US & OPEC, not markets.)

160 2018-11-14 23:42:15 Hmmm, riddle me this..why is Alberta’s crude oil worth so much less than everyone else’s? Do we sell any of our oil to any of our G7 friends at a discount compared to what our G7 friends purchase it from the Saudi’s? Asking for a friend..
161 2018-11-14 23:42:12 IM SO IMPATIENT
162 2018-11-14 23:42:09 mac and cheese. out of butter though so i used some olive oil and a bit of excess pasta water
163 2018-11-14 23:42:09 Ok that’s a fair point-so per your logic we are stuck-fed can’t raise or unwind balance sheet-so just let financial assets continue to climb / drive more inequality and embolden more trump types to peddle snake oil to the masses -I mean seems like we are in a bad spot either way
164 2018-11-14 23:42:08 There is no one size fits all when it comes to diet, weight loss & reversal of diabetes. Some people need 1 day of fasting a week, some need 2. Some people need 500ml of coconut oil daily, some need 1000ml. Some people need 10 rashers of bacon for breakfast, some need 20. #Pioppi
165 2018-11-14 23:41:54 Slump likely caused by the completion of the PNG LNG project construction phase combined with the oil price crash of 2014. Just as capital expenditure ended revenue suddenly evaporated.

167 2018-11-14 23:41:50 Shea butter, Jojoba and coconut oil work for me used together on my hands. Mine weren’t as cracked as they were dry but they were cracked too on the palms
168 2018-11-14 23:41:42 Trudeau has been thinking about scraping the Armoured Vehicles (Trucks) to Saudi Arabia, but Canada is buying their oil from Saudi’s?? Canada has enough oil for the entire Country but Trudeau’s Virtue Signalling is more important!! Hypocrite and Idiotic! FREE OUR ECONOMY!!

Not sure how impressed the islanders would be with that invasion!
You're right though, don't want a tropical paradise, they might enjoy themselves!
 Might have to create an island in the North sea for them, decommissioned oil rig?
172 2018-11-14 23:40:43 The trick is finding just the right essential oil tone to add to the ammonia.
173 2018-11-14 23:40:34 y’all pray for me bc my oil pan busted in my work parking lot and we had to clean it up bc it’s an environmental issue and now I have to replace an oil pan that’s less than 6 months old. And that means spending $$$$.
174 2018-11-14 23:40:29 Scotland really is viewed as an irritating boil requiring regular extraction of oil, brains and everything else worth profiting from.
175 2018-11-14 23:40:13 turns out that chapstick tube wasn't well sealed. Sleep well sweet prince, I'll wipe away a tear as I wipe up the puddle of vanillia scented oil you've become.

178 2018-11-14 23:40:03 Infelizmente o @VascodaGama acabou, hoje depois desse empate contra o Atlético paranaense só um milagre salva, porque não vejo capacidade e time para ganhar dos três times paulistas.

180 2018-11-14 23:39:47 My piercer told me when you clean them, add a few drops of lavender oil into the water every now and again, it’s literally done wonders for me x
181 2018-11-14 23:39:39 Cetaphil+bio for me worked wonders. And the good thing about bio oil is you don’t even need a lot of it

186 2018-11-14 23:38:41 I hope this applies to @teresakok too who should crack the whip on the oil palm industry.
187 2018-11-14 23:38:37 I was there in 2005 w/ #SAETL SA Exchange Teacher's League. Need to get back. Ran out of eucalyptus oil. That stuff is the best stain remover.

189 2018-11-14 23:38:15 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the people who control the National Enquirer. They have a stated mandate to support the oil companies and have been actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. They are not a news outlet, they are propagandists
190 2018-11-14 23:38:10 I guess we will be tucking up our kids tonight with a drop of CBD oil, Asian remedies and a cinnamon chaser. Let’s hope they don’t become T2 overnight from sipping on apple juice from treating the low.  #canteducatestupid 
191 2018-11-14 23:38:04 Hair, skin, and nail vitamins & of course everyone’s best friend, coconut oil but you have to make sure you thoroughly wash out or else it’ll be oily

193 2018-11-14 23:38:02 It would be swell if the MSM would at least touch on the massive conglomerate oil mafia clearly messing with elections directly through highjacking Conservative parties in any country trying to curb fossil fuel emissions. You know bc - life!
194 2018-11-14 23:38:00 And the worries of all the oil workers and coal miners, and of everyone who fears that change will be negative to them.
We will all have to abandon cars, heating, we will all be doomed by eco-terrorists, this is not hysteria?
Stop believing your own propaganda and fearing change
195 2018-11-14 23:37:58 Every time I’m at Costco I buy a big olive oil I couldn’t use in an apocalypse. I have two extras for trade when it does down. Keep your vinegar safe.

200 2018-11-14 23:37:26 Well since all these green products are made from fossil fuels, invest in oil.
201 2018-11-14 23:37:24 I knew it.
202 2018-11-14 23:37:22 The internal market Scotland will loose out, no I don’t think so! All that trade from Scotland exported from English ports & the oil & gas in ‘international’ waters are they English or Scottish?
203 2018-11-14 23:37:11 Brett Wilson,you  really think you so smart we older albertans forget the NEP for a made in alberta price and development of the oilsands.Your freinds in Calgary and the PC party went ballistic that PET would interfere with the free market oil system in Canada,but OK if U PROFIT
204 2018-11-14 23:37:10 You and I are like oil and water, clash at every corner.
205 2018-11-14 23:37:06 So do you believe that Co2 doesn’t negatively impact the environment? Or the government, while massively funding big oil and fracking, is then somehow at the same time paying scientists to lie to us that it is having a negative impact on our environment? The cognitive dissonance
206 2018-11-14 23:37:05 I gotta go pick up my lil oil painting at school 
207 2018-11-14 23:36:57 Ohhhh ..THAT kind of palm oil... I was off on a different tangent
208 2018-11-14 23:36:51 I adjusted your headlights, checked your fluids, and added some oil.

209 2018-11-14 23:36:38 Good luck
210 2018-11-14 23:36:37 What the actual? No one in the history of steak cooking has ever cooked a steak well on medium heat. And oil? OIL?? There should be more than enough fat rendered in the pan to flavor the steak.
211 2018-11-14 23:36:31 The snake oil salesgoon carnival barker got what was coming to him.
212 2018-11-14 23:36:10 How could that be administered with any semblance of fairness? What about oil sands SAGD, it’s not as easily shut-in. Does every producer shut-in a percentage? Only heavy? Or all, including light oil?

216 2018-11-14 23:35:38 "I know everyone is bullish on oil despite its impulsive collapse. I keep reading commentary from people being stopped out by P&L necessity and doing so begrudgingly.

230 2018-11-14 23:34:19 The oil alone  didn't  it's what they done with the money that  did. Uk wasted the money by putting it all into  things the country needed. Norway were more careful and invested some of the money, smart but they had a different situation to the need in the UK.

237 2018-11-14 23:33:21 So impressive  Perhaps I’m biased. People are quick to denigrate oil and gas. And I often wonder if the population are really cognisant of how much of the world around them comes from these organic sources.. #STEM
238 2018-11-14 23:33:11 As soon as it happened I treated it with ice, fresh aloe, lavender oil, and coconut oil. Took the burning out almost immediately and it didn’t blister, but it has been very dry and is now starting to peel from scrape a little earlier than it should. I’ve been washing it

240 2018-11-14 23:33:09 @timandsid Wow is @Ericfrancis out of touch with reality! Calgary taxpayers are already stretched to the limit, and he says Calgary needs to "get out of the oil business". What a complete moron!
241 2018-11-14 23:33:00 You are that way, but not rational AGW people who just go along with it.  You are a priest of AGW.  I want a general person who wants a cleaner environment and who may think CO2 may be a problem.  The also want to get the oil out for other reasons.  Lots of reason for lower fuel.
242 2018-11-14 23:32:51 The notion that ANY companies can, or should, self-regulate doesn’t cut it (see: oil, Wall Street, airlines, health care, etc. ad nauseum)

245 2018-11-14 23:32:25 I’m a Scot and I can say that, unless Scotland can sell oil over $100 per barrel, it will struggle. When the EU impose a minimum corporation tax of 20% (coming soon), Ireland will have a massive recession. Joining the Euro was also a HUGE mistake. Will be evident next downturn.

259 2018-11-14 23:30:13 Thinking of the oil and gas show at $410 sq ft there is definitely an economic model there. I just think it needs more abstract perspective to gain public investment to actually get things built ie partial upgrading 39 billion for 96 tax revenue and 30% more pipeline capacity.

261 2018-11-14 23:30:06 The CAD is still overvalued vis à vis the US$. Housing, low oil prices and inventories the burden now and expect weaker canadian dollar over time as Fed will raise more than BOC
262 2018-11-14 23:30:04 So sad. I just found out that Cadburys, Oreos and Ritz crackers have allegedly all contributed to massive Palm Oil deforestation and Orangutan demise. I’ll never buy these products again as long as I live. #PalmOil
263 2018-11-14 23:30:04 I always thought that Michael Avenatti was a snake oil salesman. Whenever I hear of a male feminist getting dinged for sexual harassment or assault, I have a dark chuckle at the hypocrisy.

265 2018-11-14 23:29:35 Cleanse every morning and evening, get yourself a good moisturiser its so dependant on skin type I just trial and error if I'm honest. And for lips make a lip scrub, I do coconut oil and sugar! do it 2-3 times a week until our lips a soft and then you can do it when needed
266 2018-11-14 23:29:33 if you don't eat fish, then you can make a kind of pesto with the salad bag you buy in the supermarket.

271 2018-11-14 23:28:30 Notice how how fake snake oil salesmen ‘anti war’ pundits like Tucker Carlson never put the blame for Neocon policies and actions on Trump’s own doorstep?

272 2018-11-14 23:28:25 Not to mention most scientist who fund climate change research make PEANUTS in that realm, compared to their primary work - follow the money? The money isn’t in renewable energy, it’s IN FUCKING OIL

281 2018-11-14 23:26:51 Talk about hypotheticals and rumours  causing the yes votes to no...Then in the same segment, @EricFrancis is going to say that the olympics would be the kickstart to diversifying #yyc from oil and gas. 
Maybe these types of huge promises with little founded facts is the reason.
282 2018-11-14 23:26:44 that's the most disappointing part: i actually miss liquid cod liver oil!
283 2018-11-14 23:26:44 I spy, with my little eye, something that isn't a white, male, snake oil salesman!
284 2018-11-14 23:26:27 Gabby off the fresh wash, tires rotated, & oil change. I love my dealership lol we here winter what’s good
285 2018-11-14 23:26:26 yes baby crack my back , rub some oil , make me feel looovveeeddd.
286 2018-11-14 23:26:22 Wild growth oil was really a life savior for me
287 2018-11-14 23:26:21 WHY IS CBD OIL OVER $32,OOO. A YEAR?
288 2018-11-14 23:26:17 Lucky the fire in the fireplace did not set the oil slick ablaze.
289 2018-11-14 23:26:11 What incentive do scientists have to lie about climate change? Oil has the power, the money, and The government in their back pocket. If you believe facts, then why Deny 95% of scientists who say this is a real and obvious threat to humanity?
290 2018-11-14 23:25:47 Possibilities like CBD softgels, along the lines of many vitamin-A/D/E supplements. Fixes the flavor issue.

There will always be room for a cottage industry of more niche products like the plain oil (*cough* Whole Foods) but mass market really needs a step up.
291 2018-11-14 23:25:33 #Oil markets halted their 12-day losses and bounced after the reports that #OPEC and its allies are in discussion to cut supply in 2019. The #EIAReport and and Tweets from President Trump regarding oil prices could exert higher pressure on oil prices in the short run.

293 2018-11-14 23:25:16 Meaning hardly going to relinquish my citizenship and march off to war for the US for US oil interests.
294 2018-11-14 23:25:00 Irony is that it crashed with an oil tanker, and it’s fine...
295 2018-11-14 23:24:55 I get that, but who would do that!!!?? In the above salad, it's all about knife skills so you get the perfect ratio of all the ingredients: onion, mint and salt are accidents and really great quality tomatoes and oil do the talking as the main ingredient.
296 2018-11-14 23:24:45 Trim the wick to an upside down "V" in an oil lamp to get maximum light and efficient oil burning
297 2018-11-14 23:24:31 i dont get ppl who feel the need to touch black women hair like do you not have common decency? why would they want ur nasty hand oil in their hair, not to mention personal space? i dont get it
298 2018-11-14 23:24:28 My car is leaking oil I just love that for me
299 2018-11-14 23:24:21 Oklahoma does the same for the oil industry.
300 2018-11-14 23:24:20 @peta have a bloody cheek give #Dove a cruelty free certificate. Is susspose the petition on #Greenpeace asking you to stop using palm oil, killing the rainforest & animals who live in it, is see no evil hear no evil. Shame on you @dove . #IcelandAdvert #PalmOil
301 2018-11-14 23:24:17 How? Obama had Gaddafi assassinated so white-supremacist govt's could steal Libya's oil & resources, while bringing slavery back to Africa.
302 2018-11-14 23:24:16 I want the same as You an earth that's clean and without pollution.But when Banks(libor,whitewash),Oil companies(biggest Polluter),NGO(child trafficking,Palm oil)Government(global taxation)come together every alarm must be ringing.
303 2018-11-14 23:24:16 The dude at the oil place was low key so nasty and so rude, which is fine because I will email corporate.
304 2018-11-14 23:24:11 They will get to fixing it right after all those "we are fighting for Alberta/our Oil&Gas" industry tweets, right?
Is that how it works?

306 2018-11-14 23:24:07 They are making a move towards no.palm.oil. which is.why.products are labled so !!!!
Nobody's perfect but its a great start. Marketing stunt or.not

310 2018-11-14 23:23:53 when white people recommend shea butter or coconut oil to me i just.. i have to laugh...
311 2018-11-14 23:23:51 Not 100% true but it's true. Canola/soybean oil in every bread you can find at Walmart/Target.
312 2018-11-14 23:23:49 Nabisco akso uses massive amounts of palm oil, and rhey dont have to. In fact, their products would be far better without it.
313 2018-11-14 23:23:47 I had to read that ten times to make sense, for lack of a couple of commas. To be serious though, it may be exaggerated but is is BS? Given their very deep pockets (unlikely to change soon), is it not better that they do serious research on this & other topics  than oil research?
314 2018-11-14 23:23:35 Herbs and butter or olive oil underneath would be great.
315 2018-11-14 23:23:30 1 mark for complying with EU law; 2 marks for the pre-70's precedent; 8 marks for complying with UAE oil projections.
316 2018-11-14 23:23:30 on a side note, a customer gave me their business card to start buying cbd oil from her and said we can “meet up and talk” and well, there’s that
317 2018-11-14 23:23:23 Omg broccoli cauliflower sweet potato chopped smallish and whole garlic cloves tossed in olive oil salt pepper and paprika then roasted till the garlic is just soft and a little brown is. The. Bomb
318 2018-11-14 23:23:17 so until death we back up the oil and gas industry that factually derails the environment? lol. i also majored in sustainable development. yes, you can get your degree from an institution and then no longer support it when you become informed.
319 2018-11-14 23:23:16 I recommend CBD oil
320 2018-11-14 23:23:13 You said no to the money, dumb ass...you cant have the car OR pay rent. No new pipelines are being built and the price of oil isnt rebounding... real smart decision you made there, Angie
321 2018-11-14 23:23:11 Khichdi, Muri with Sesame Oil is a 2 minute hack. And yummy at that.
Between 1994-2005, my average work hours were 9-1(16 hours)! I have cooked meals after that at 1pm (whenever I found, the food in the otg/microwave kept for me by Shree was not to my liking. Milk+Bhuiia+Sugar
322 2018-11-14 23:23:05 And just buy oil and a oil filter and do it yourself @PaigeKpc
323 2018-11-14 23:23:02 republicans are a huge impediment, granted. but it’s not like democrats want us to sprint away from gas and oil. fucking manchin is a coal baron on the energy committee.
324 2018-11-14 23:22:58 better massage them thangs with castor oil & lavender essential oil
325 2018-11-14 23:22:50 Not a helpful response. It shows he really doesn't grasp the fact that his policies are already sending the economy into reverse. Look at housing, autos, semis, oil & lumber prices and numerous other signs that the Fed has already gone too far.
326 2018-11-14 23:22:45 I went to Jiffy Lube & the worker says “is it... jaelyne? Pretty close to GAYlyne.....”  I can’t catch a break from the roasts even when I’m getting my oil changed by a stranger smfh
327 2018-11-14 23:22:34 I agree Doug. He looks a wonderful young player and as clubs focus on their selections maybe he is bolting up the draft order (similar to Clayton Oliver). Maybe, just maybe, Stevens has good oil here.
328 2018-11-14 23:22:26 Hell, you can even warm them up in the microwave and toss them in with the ravioli and a little bit of olive oil, salt and pepper *chef kiss*
329 2018-11-14 23:22:22 When I was getting an oil change, this nice older woman, named Ann, sparked up conversation with me. We talked about her military experience, how her brother lives in Phoenix who is also a fireman, and how she loves her little VW Bug. It was just really sweet and I needed that.
330 2018-11-14 23:22:16 Don't get the logic of people refusing to buy products with palm oil to save orangutans when they just continue to eat meat?
331 2018-11-14 23:22:14 Victory Fund donors include DNC Treasurer William Derrough, lobbyist Michael Berman, oil tycoon heirs Gordon and Ann Getty, former Bill Clinton adviser Tom Werner, billionaire George Marcus and former White House Press Secretary under Obama and now Amazon Senior VP James Carney.
332 2018-11-14 23:22:13 I just got an oil change. please give me the praise and respect that I deserve
333 2018-11-14 23:21:58 Beautiful! Hope you are trying CBD oil for your recovering fingers? It is definitely God Given 
334 2018-11-14 23:21:57 But isn’t there a decline in oil investment everywhere due to low oil prices? Combined Q3 Alberta Oilsands net earnings topped $5B this year. We need added pipeline capacity no question, but need to go easy on the doom & gloom.
335 2018-11-14 23:21:53 Oil changed 
336 2018-11-14 23:21:50 @realDonaldTrump @fox @msnbc. Trump voters, man have you been played The snake oil salesman got you all lathered up about the “Invasion of the Immigrants”, the contagious caravan. But now that he has your money and your vote he’s silent. “Fool me once....
337 2018-11-14 23:21:49 Humans were tasked to be caretakers of this earth. They are failing miserably in that duty. People cry and whine “why does god let bad things happen?” and the most high will ask “why did you kill all the whales for oil?” and humans have no response. Do dolphins believe in humans?
338 2018-11-14 23:21:35 My cars in getting serviced and they’ve tried to tell me that it’s leaking oil but it hasn’t been leaking shit up until right now so they better not have fucked my car.

341 2018-11-14 23:21:15 Hmm, perhaps the article had some unacknowledged inspiration! 

And yes, totally agree: for many, the emotional comfort of a warm bowl of oatmeal likely “outweighs” a spoonful of coconut oil (literally and figuratively) in its sustenance of motivation.
342 2018-11-14 23:21:14 Saudi Arabia. What a fucked up country! Watching “#SaudiArabia Uncovered” on #Netflix. If it wasn’t for oil, the #US #Military would be bombing it!
343 2018-11-14 23:21:13 @SunPatOfficial Why don’t you list Palm Oil on the ingredients instead of the all encompassing ‘Stabiliser: E471’?
344 2018-11-14 23:21:09 If you leave any natural oil exposed to air on it's own it'll go rancid eventually. You'll need to mix them with something to keep it preserved, like neat alcohol.
345 2018-11-14 23:21:06 Wonderful film. It certainly opened my eyes no more products with palm oil for me.
346 2018-11-14 23:21:06 But #oil $DBC?

349 2018-11-14 23:21:03 Labour will not be taken serious till they go back into the centre like they did under Blair. Just take away all the pointless oil wars.
350 2018-11-14 23:20:53 There’s upsides and downsides to 1911s of course. I carried one for a long time. One major upside is how slim they are. Even the full sized 1911s are nicely concealable.
351 2018-11-14 23:20:47 good luck with this- it will fail- oil is so down in price that even if the regime manages to sell any, they cannot bear the cost of their imperial ambitions: wars in Syria and Yemen, exporting terrorism and their nuclear program.

Trump is crushing them

356 2018-11-14 23:20:41 It’s reeked havoc on our health too. There was an additional oil spill a few years ago. Since then I’ve gotten shingles twice, I’m perfectly healthy.

358 2018-11-14 23:20:32 Sometimes I just changed shades of lipstick.  Once I changed my oil.
359 2018-11-14 23:20:28 They can't raise enough tax independently and off-shore oil is drying up.

Unless they have an untapped market in fried Mars bars and Haggis that ain't gonna happen.
360 2018-11-14 23:20:21 "I dont like people who tend to be environmentalists, so I'm irrationally skeptical of the most crucial public policy issue we face, also, im not skeptical at all of the YTers who are literally backed by the oil and gas industry" Yes, you smart

382 2018-11-14 23:17:20 Depressed Canadian oil prices are NOW costing Albertans $Billions in lower royalty payments

Our government has the power to fix the problem by mandating temporary production cuts to bring the market into balance.

It’s the right solution to a made-in-Canada crisis.

392 2018-11-14 23:15:49 @APPropst Global markets attempt to play catch-up as the oil industry declines and suffers from an all time low. If price declines are driven by shifts in demand of oil, will other developing countries be negatively effected?

404 2018-11-14 23:14:38 Well, yeah, but those tiny little CBD oil bottles at their prices... bleh. I mean it needs a full-fledged industry so it's both simpler and, more importantly, cheaper for self medication purposes.
405 2018-11-14 23:14:35 4/ hard time for Unicorns

Certainly, part of 2018 rally on US equities and oil prices were justified by both stronger fundamentals, lower equity risk premia, higher geopolitical risk premia, blabla...
- But then came the slump of October...
406 2018-11-14 23:14:35 Thanks for sharing this - I don’t think people are getting full perspective - while 1 will give up oil 10 won’t that’s the issue palm oil needs sustainability/stricter control need to make less - other oils are much worse - consumer behaviour determines and drives markets

Valuation = how much money will I make my VC?
Business model = trying to sell snake oil instead of taking another round
Moat = can we make this a monopoly?
Lock in = can we make this a monopoly?

412 2018-11-14 23:13:35 done a bunch of research on palm oil tonight and the amount of makeup brands that use it is shocking :( seriously reconsidering who I buy from 
413 2018-11-14 23:13:08 We're not. We're encouraged that religious extremists fronting for Big oil men have lost to grassroots local candidates.

415 2018-11-14 23:12:56 Honest question, is there a difference between deep fryer and pan fry other than the depth of oil? I guess he needs it shallow enough to allow half in?

480 2018-11-14 23:06:30 In respect to how we get our energy, incremental liberalism was moving way in the right direction (the solar and car subsidies were huge), but the Republicans have resisted every attack on coal and oil. 

I will never understand the attacks on wind turbines.

482 2018-11-14 23:05:55 Funnily enough it wa Iceland who raised my awareness in the first place when I saw posters advertising that they would only sell palm oil products that were produced in a responsible manner - then I read up.
483 2018-11-14 23:05:39 This database/program is surely contributing to the inflation problem with currency creation to pay for it. Or perhaps China is getting something in exchange. Like future oil rights.

488 2018-11-14 23:04:52 people defending Bethesda for using gambryo because "all engines are iterative" is like saying your 1995 Ford Ranger is still good because you slapped on new tires, changed the oil, put in a Bluetooth radio, and added a fresh coat of paint on it.

499 2018-11-14 23:03:13 Thankfully the Kirkland rip off version (which is palm oil free I believe) is really good and works in my ‘Nutella therapy cookies’ recipe too.
500 2018-11-14 23:03:07 Hey guys

Just a friendly reminder that although olive oil is considered a health food

it really ain't when heated, especially on high temp
501 2018-11-14 23:03:01 Leaning on people because the oil price isn't right (for the leaners) is not good business.
502 2018-11-14 23:02:58 You should try using coconut oil to pop it with,so yummy 
503 2018-11-14 23:02:57 Just kind of got shot during all the gunfire when you steal the oil wagon.
504 2018-11-14 23:02:38 The trouble is though that massive swathes of Borneo have already been ripped up for palm oil plantations

That was pristine forest which would take multiple generations to grow back at the very least

I love the smell of nae palm in the morning.

I like tinned tuna if it’s ‘upgraded’ with olive oil, lemon, ground pepper, & CAPERS. You should try expensive tinned tuna from Spain.

521 2018-11-14 23:01:01 Styes form as a result of dirt and oil buildup in the oil glands found around your lashes. This causes clogging of the oil gland. To treat them, try some over-the-counter remedies, which can be found at your local drug store.

534 2018-11-14 22:59:48 “Sustainable” Palm Oil is the most hilarious thing I’ve seen recently. Those orangutans living next door to the sustainable farm really appreciate it

540 2018-11-14 22:59:02 Said the oil company.
541 2018-11-14 22:58:54 There is a large body of research on it in other countries, so even if we have very limited research avenues here (at least right now), we do have a good idea what benefits we can expect from it.

And having it in a purified form (oil, capsule, or gummy) works really well.

546 2018-11-14 22:58:26 Sitting here straight up cringing while waiting for my oil to be changed because 1. my car is trashed and 2. there’s probably so much wrong with it I bet they’re all laughing at me like haha wow this stupid bitch.
547 2018-11-14 22:58:24 Honestly but hey at least I know where to get a good price on motor oil this winter
548 2018-11-14 22:58:23 — tea tree oil: mix a dash of tea tree oil into less than half a cup of water. then dip cotton into the solution and applying it directly to a pimple. repeat this 1-2 times a day. use a moisturizer thereafter, if required.

553 2018-11-14 22:57:35 Cut the sales tax on uncooked vegetables/meat.  Also milk, butter, oil, rice and flour.  The rest of the groceries can stay taxed.  We don’t need Kansans blimping up like our Okie neighbors.

559 2018-11-14 22:57:19 Let's have this slippery Oily Robbins the snake oil salesman exposed now .
560 2018-11-14 22:57:18 @timandsid So Eric Francis thinks Calgary should have said yes to the Olympics so they could get government money. How about Alberta stops depending on oil so much and adapts with the times. Now he’s not proud of the city? What a goof. #Calgary2026
561 2018-11-14 22:57:05 It was working pretty well in Venezuela until undermined by the US and depressed oil prices.  
But where socialism works really well is much of Europe especially the Nordic countries.  They don't call it socialism.  They call it being civilized. Happiest people in the world
562 2018-11-14 22:56:58 BTC drop seems to be affected by OIL price dropping. HODL, rebound will be epic. pure market manipulation by the trumpis at its finest
563 2018-11-14 22:56:54 Cleansing oil gets rid of dirt from pores. You need to be double cleansing. Massaging in a cleansing oil well then rinse with water then use a foam cleanser. I would use a cold jade roller to try and reduce pores and redness.
564 2018-11-14 22:56:46 Absolutely! I look at Denver and the Denver Tech Center, whichbwas formed as a Tax Haven to bring high tech to Denver after they relied on Oil industry so much. 

It completely transformed the region.

I think if done right it can be done well.
565 2018-11-14 22:56:42 lucky if you can find one that fries with veg oil,and then the veggie option is usually a buttered roll.jackpot if they've actually got a cheese and onion pie!
566 2018-11-14 22:56:27 Maybe oil free then, unless you don’t mind the glow or use a powder!
567 2018-11-14 22:56:23 Ok...I believe the snake oil we were sold was that the deficit was going to go down. What are you willing to cut? Social security, Medicare, or defense...with trillion dollar plus deficits those are the only way to fix it.

584 2018-11-14 22:55:05 How does stopping CDN oil from getting to market and it being replaced in WORLD markets by less ethical producers help avoid your supposed catastrophic scenario? It would speed it up.  Read her material before you rant.
585 2018-11-14 22:54:49 Nope. Sliced tomatoes, shredded mint, red onion, salt and olive oil is the BEST salad.
586 2018-11-14 22:54:47 What they're doing with moving away from palm oil is great, but hubby said the same when the advert started going around social media. Political adverts are banned fullstop not matter what their content. If it;s allowed it sets a dangerous precedent. Social media however 
587 2018-11-14 22:54:43 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO

589 2018-11-14 22:54:30 Plantains can also be yellow.  Teach teach teach.  Are you frying those and serving with chopped garlic or are you boiling them?  If you boil them, then mash them you can serve with a gravy of tomato, onion chopped up hot and sweet peppers and oil.  Meat is up to you.
590 2018-11-14 22:54:26 Don’t advise this, it’s what they are paying you for! If you take your car for a service you don’t change the oil yourself!
591 2018-11-14 22:54:17 LEt us check out you problem car for FREE. we will only charge you for the repair. Oil change is only $20.
592 2018-11-14 22:54:13 Ok but real rates were still going up. It doesn’t track oil. More specifically it tracks dollar weighted real rates
593 2018-11-14 22:53:42 Ha ha!  You’re not getting your wall because Mexico won’t pay for it.  You got conned by a snake oil salesman.

606 2018-11-14 22:52:40 Who rhe fuck is this guy? Oil and banking printing fake money is probably better deal, 
607 2018-11-14 22:52:37 I agree with this but I also think starting to care about palm oil could start up a dialogue and start people caring. I know it's not enough and I know it's not happening fast enough but unfortunately we have to play this game and stomach carnist's patheticness for now.
608 2018-11-14 22:52:37 Could be a 2 day Bullish Harami candle pattern on Brent Oil Spot. RSI 20 is extremely low. It might try to turn up very soon.

628 2018-11-14 22:50:16 produk turunan seperti stearic acid, glycerine bahkan natural vitamin jauh memiliki nilai tambah lebih tinggi daripada minyak goreng atau CPO saja. keep it up bang. buat road map industri palm oil yg ber added value tinggi.

671 2018-11-14 22:45:45 2/ They put a platform up of 6 action points.

Energy Independence. They shut well & refused new permits, but never offered an alternative. So we ended up importing more oil.

691 2018-11-14 22:43:22 Yes pipelines and partial upgrading to reduce 30% of the diluent occupying the lines from oilsands. We have 200k bpd in excess oil production now that needs to be moved. This is the answer.
692 2018-11-14 22:43:20 Green beans should be fresh and sauteed in oil or if you're feeling very adventurous a little bit of grass fed butter then lately sea salted and peppered and enjoyed still warm. Don't goop up my green beans.

694 2018-11-14 22:43:05 Bullshit excuse from Clearcast!! HSBC have a lot of money tied up with Palm oil and they fund a lot of work done by Clearcast so make your own assumptions on why Clearcast said the ad was political and goes against the rules....!!

712 2018-11-14 22:40:59 My nose gets so dry this time of the year to the point it hurts and bleeds.. 2 days of putting a little bit of coconut oil in it and omg what a world of difference!! If you have issues with dry nostrils, I highly recommend rubbing just a little bit of coconut oil up in there!
713 2018-11-14 22:40:49 Regarding the agreement, this has never been fully published. Nobody knows exactly the terms of service and how much oil revenues have been wasted there. Moreover, many doctors profited to escape when posted close to the border
714 2018-11-14 22:40:47 @timandsid I’m happy it was a no that province has been hurting with fire in Ft Mac and major layoffs in the oil industry people’s jobs and lively hoods are more important. I am sports fan but not at the cost that will hurt.

717 2018-11-14 22:40:16 I’m tempted by a new principle - the quantity of snake oil is in inverse proportion to the fees charged
718 2018-11-14 22:40:14 What about the oil field and Offshore workers
719 2018-11-14 22:40:10 Again I agree.  Here in Great Falls the oil refinery was doing a $300MM upgrade which would increase their taxable value hence taxes.  They asked for an abatement to stagger the raises.  The city/county said no.  Think GF will be the first place that gets upgraded in the future?

727 2018-11-14 22:39:34 Sorry this is late notice. I won't be online tonight. I had to replace the brakes on my truck and do an oil change. And it took far longer than I thought it would. I will be online tomorrow and there will be a stream on Saturday during the day and perhaps a late night stream too.
728 2018-11-14 22:39:30 Oil just crashed 30%. Look at inflation expextations and real rates, which metals track inversely. Fed will keep hawkish language until 2019 unless we get a total meltdown, so real rates and dollar will continue to rise, imo. I bet he capitulates after we get q4 gdp though
729 2018-11-14 22:39:23 Republicans would attack a gold-encrusted bowl of pure Exxon crude oil if it was a democrat, it’s unrelated to effectiveness. Her main achievement was passing a republican healthcare bill in an overwhelming dem house. She was done when she said ‘bipartisan marketplace of ideas.’
730 2018-11-14 22:39:22 Nigeria that we do not, even know our population. Nigeria that we don't even know, how many barrel of crude oil we produce a day? I beg all these figure you guys formulate are just lie.

732 2018-11-14 22:39:19 Packed up, put away and battened down outside, had a bowl of pasta with oil, butter, scallions & Parmesan, looked after some online business and an heading for a nap. Kelly's roast chicken & beans & rice for Sushi Pat's family smells awesome!
733 2018-11-14 22:39:15 It was unhelpful to the argument that U.S. foreign policy is not controlled by oil interests, that's for sure.
734 2018-11-14 22:39:13 Another speaker says the region's oil, gas and access to the Mississippi River is the incentive for industrial companies to want to be located here--not tax breaks.

739 2018-11-14 22:38:46 Im seeing tweets concerning #palmoil lately, im glad! Yall dont have to give up good stuff, just make your own. A lot of cookie and sweet recipes are much easier than people think and you can control exactly what ingredients go in. Enjoy yourself and to palm oil
740 2018-11-14 22:38:33 @IcelandFoods I read an article which said you swap for alternative palm oil not sustainable palm oil, is this correct? Alternatives ruin much more rainforest and sustainable palm oil is a better route. What is your stance? Was very dissapointed reading.
741 2018-11-14 22:38:25 Dude. You are whack. Oil companies are one of the easiest to control. Just a small change in American consumption can bring them to their knees.
742 2018-11-14 22:38:23 Until we adopt Nikola Tesla technology I think it's another 100 years of oil

760 2018-11-14 22:35:41 It’s why our government folds all of the time in favor of the left. It’s the “squeaky wheel gets the oil” effect. 
The Right keeps trying to be tolerant and the bigger person, while the left forces their will upon the country’s leaders. Close mouths don’t get fed.

769 2018-11-14 22:34:52 I'm gonna say it here bc I'm too chicken to say it on my personal acc - banning palm oil is a stupid idea
770 2018-11-14 22:34:51 No no, hats off to @IcelandFoods for what they are trying to do. When I can I always try to avoid stuff with palm oil in, ever since I watched some documentary a few years back about it's production. I was just hoping they'd sell some biscuits that didn't contain the sht.

779 2018-11-14 22:34:24 Indeed. I only use olive oil and try to read labels for everything I purchase. I’m consumer savvy and brand loyal, so once I find a sustainable, Earth friendly product I like, I won’t try anything else. 
780 2018-11-14 22:34:13 Not commenting on your arguement other than to give it frame of reference. No one voted to ban e-cigs, that was tacked onto a bill to ban offshore oil drilling. That's what we voted for. Just a piece of info for you.

788 2018-11-14 22:33:38 Ofcourse we have been lied to and keep being lied to, but: if records keep being broken reason dictates that peak oil/gas will be reached sooner than later.
789 2018-11-14 22:33:23 This is an obvious, patently absurd falsehood. We will not ru. Out of oil in your or my lifetime or our grandchildren. And by the way, timing matters.

826 2018-11-14 22:29:13 Sturgeon really gets on my tits! Why don’t we let Scotland have another referendum and see how she gets on when all her oil runs out! Such a negative pain in the arse.

Had the most frustrating thing happen to me this morning. I got up to wash my face with my rose hip oil and it was EVERYWHERE. Luckily I was able to head to my local health food store with my receipt and get another bottle of it. Talk about a bad start. Oh well

848 2018-11-14 22:26:44 The worlds changed. The rush for mineral wealth in other people’s countries ended after oil in the Middle East. Once we have reliable rocket ships the surrounding planets can be our sources of wealth and The Royal Navy can sail the high atmospheres.  For now #remain

Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes.

Add several drops of the essential oil.

Whisk until mixture thickens.

Pour mixture into a glass with a cap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Huh.
873 2018-11-14 22:23:42 If they are seeking to change that, and make launching profitable, why is it bad to have them refocusing a war machine into something not meant for war?

905 2018-11-14 22:19:49 If you use 30-50 year old specs, and then compare it to some utopian place in order to vilify an industry, you come out with a jaded view of reality.

921 2018-11-14 22:18:22 Hi Francine. Your article says investment into American oil will recover to 2014 levels by 2024, proving that investment in oil is down across the board. It also warns that the oil industry is embracing technology making jobs disappear.

939 2018-11-14 22:17:15 Disagree... This is a well funded fossil energy campaign to disrupt the rapidly unfolding growth of EV's which threaten their survival... This is a high stakes game against a trillion dollar industry which we MUST win but shorting is one of MANY ploys being used by big oil
940 2018-11-14 22:17:09 So Iceland telling the truth about palm oil and the deforestation that happens when producing it ruffles a few feathers because snowflakes can’t handle facts.  Absolute imbeciles all those who complained.
941 2018-11-14 22:16:58 Buzz off, JA. I don’t believe big oil. I believe facts & they include lies & data changes by experts. Who funds these ‘scientists,’ huh? Government does. It’s in their best interest to scare the shit out of you so funding continues. It’s not difficult to follow the money

944 2018-11-14 22:16:35 It's really a catch 22 because if everyone stopped buying products with palm oil in tomorrow , palm oil (a hugely efficient crop) would be replaced by coconut or, rapeseed, which require far more room to grow .
945 2018-11-14 22:16:30 Jimmy was facing with a stagnant economy & inflation caused by RMN's disastrous policy, easy money from the Fed & the Vietnam War debacle.

Unfortunately Jerry Ford's "WIN" (Whip inflation now) button didn't fix the economy.
946 2018-11-14 22:16:26 Roughly 80-85% of all CO2 generated when burning oil is generated at the point of consumption. Alberta Oil Sands traditionally used a lot of energy, but with modern SAGD installations, which accounts for the vast majority today, it is comparable to conventional heavy oil.

954 2018-11-14 22:15:32 And here is the kicker. Why do US refiners not run all that cheap shale oil? Why do the export it and import expensive foreign oil? Because their refiners cannot run more. Growth rate in how much shale refiners can run is much smaller than growth rate of shale

956 2018-11-14 22:14:59 Sooo the guys that put oil in my car didn’t replace the oil cap so the engine is now COVERED in oil and I drove probably 900 miles this weekend with NO OIL... if you want something done right, do it yourself.
957 2018-11-14 22:14:48 Cool graphic. Now inform Canadians how much money is traded for Saudi oil every day and how much we lose trading oil to the US because of the discount in Western Select.

960 2018-11-14 22:14:17 Yesterday I cooked a steak in a mushrooms thyme sauce.  The sides were potatoes (cooked in olive oil, rosemary and scallion), and Brussel sprouts and herbs

It was sublime.

Tonight, pork loin stuffed with stuff and baked potatoes... we will see how it turns out..

966 2018-11-14 22:13:21 my Uber driver just referred Black Seed Oil for lucid dreaming. does anyone have any experience with this specific substance?

all replies welcomed!
967 2018-11-14 22:13:20 I second the mm option as I have avoided nightmares that way. Will CBD oil help at all? For me it was the BEST for anxiety and I have what you have.
968 2018-11-14 22:13:18 This is all oil painting James but equally applicable to acrylic.
969 2018-11-14 22:13:15 The United States is in too deep with Saudi Arabia to really do anything. Oil, arms sales, and keeping Iran “in check” will hamper any real initiative. This goes back quite a awhile.

975 2018-11-14 22:12:45 Let's recap what your freedaum fitas did nothing about:
Malqysia. today- protecting human rights by embargo on palm oil, which destroyed work places, enforcing more poverty than ever on those people.
Rwanda, 1993 - because they had not interest there.
976 2018-11-14 22:12:43 USW is n the process of negotiations for (oil refiners) contract is up 3/19. Let’s see what u will do for them....
977 2018-11-14 22:12:39 We're sorry if you're alarmed! And that's correct: what you're seeing is a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow. Thank you!

979 2018-11-14 22:12:33 For sure. So, tips: Preheat, use butter/oil, and to clean, add a bit of water to the pan and heat to a boil... then deglaze and clean. And enjoy the ride!

Now ask yourself, who benefits from clean technology and sustainable systems?
The first answer is big oil. The second, all of us, which conveniently also answers the third question.

995 2018-11-14 22:10:41 My mama told me if I can get up and wash dishes then I can drive and get my engine oil  she don’t understand that I’m still HALF DEAD 
996 2018-11-14 22:10:41 Absolutely, LPG is the most diverse and useful fuel with the lowest C02 output compared to oil fuel. More investment IN LPG and the education on the benefits of it Combined with BIOLPG manufacture and the future for our industry is bright.
997 2018-11-14 22:10:39 A lot of us already know about animal ag. That it is responsible for, more deforestation than palm oil, more GHG than cars, trains & planes put together, more use of antibiotics than doctors, it truly is a disgusting filthy evil business.

You can also get the CBD as an oil and add it to his favorite snacks. It's really something special. Companies have even started to produce CBD dog treats.

1017 2018-11-14 22:08:55 LOL... right now oil is our main source of energy. In case you can't read he's also discussing nuclear and natural gas energy with the Europeans.  He's getting them to buy American NG brining money into the USA.. sorry you libs have a problem with that.

1020 2018-11-14 22:08:34 Quite relieved I can't eat it after seeing the palm oil info! Definitely reading more labels from now on!
1021 2018-11-14 22:08:26 We need to support sustainable palm oil, not ban it, replanting needs to happen to reverse deforestation. Regeneration of orangutan’s habitat, plus support for local economies.
1022 2018-11-14 22:08:24  Loved that one and the bar one. The minimulist one and yellow bench though.  Oil painting increases in value the most. Needs to be right size though. Taxerdmy big no no. Didnt want it to finish.

1033 2018-11-14 22:07:20 Hi Amy. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018.
1034 2018-11-14 22:07:15 Mani, pedi, wax and oil change by Friday? How Sway
1035 2018-11-14 22:07:14 NO its voted down they go back to the drawing board and set it at a decent price.The money for drilling IS there-they've had loads of placings and the Bergen deal.
1036 2018-11-14 22:07:13 Palm oil is fine. It’s the most efficient oil to grow and takes up far less space than other oils would. It’s sustainability that companies need to achieve. Boycotting palm oil will just move the problem elsewhere
1037 2018-11-14 22:07:00 Ashley Petersen, senior oil market analyst at @StratasAdvisors, told the @PropaneCouncil last week in Savannah, Georgia: “The U.S. is a mature market, and that requires thinking on your feet. It requires diverse sector targeting to take advantage of the opportunities out there.”
1038 2018-11-14 22:06:56 That certainly will put a dent in the popup CBD oil marketing firms roaming the countryside.
1039 2018-11-14 22:06:48 anyways while we’re on the topic of sustainablity .... we need to legalize hemp! it’s illegal in some places bc it closely resembles marijuana but it contains no cbd oil and it actually so sustainable for many reasons i won’t bore everyone with!! thank u for coming to my ted talk
1040 2018-11-14 22:06:36 Positives for the day: Crude oil finished at $55.96/bbl and the 10-year went out at 3.13%. At these levels neither crude nor interest rates should derail the economy.

1062 2018-11-14 22:04:26 I heard drinking oil from the tap solves a lot of health problems.
1063 2018-11-14 22:04:11 It's more likely to just come off if you grab it and pull but I find it doesn't smear as long as there's not too much oil. Which can be solved with a dusting of powder.

1088 2018-11-14 22:01:44 $15 WCS but $1.14/l gasoline and $1.28/l diesel in Saskatoon.... nice that oil production companies know how It feels sometimes
1089 2018-11-14 22:01:37 Good point.  He ignored the biggest demonstration in British history but fully heeded one Texan oil man.
1090 2018-11-14 22:01:33 Use tea tree oil 2 times a day and use sea salt not regular salt
1091 2018-11-14 22:01:30 If you think door to door salesmen and the LDS guys are bad, try putting up with commercial oil and tire salesmen during the holiday seasons.
1092 2018-11-14 22:01:22 @FordService 2008 Ford F150, 79K,  miles. Completely stock except for tires and battery.  Yesterday my oil pressure gauge stopped working. I had it checked and they said the module was bad. All other gauges work. Is there any warranty on these modules?
1093 2018-11-14 22:01:22 A decent caster oil can help eyelashes. Worth a try.
1094 2018-11-14 22:01:16 Well, I reckon you guys may have been importing oil for free from Saudi Arabia. you give 'em security they give you oil . That's just how it's always been
1095 2018-11-14 22:01:11 An 8 million barrel build in  crude oil and the market isn’t much lower —Dare I say it’s building a base? #Crude #OOTT —Can’t see how tomorrow’s number will beat this one… But I have been surprised before

1098 2018-11-14 22:00:56 Why was @IcelandFoods advert banned, I didn’t even know about palm oil and the harm it has caused, people need to be made aware before they can make a change

Paul Martin and his ship company has his fingerprints on this file, too.  Look under filthy rocks and you will find wealthy Libs.
1103 2018-11-14 22:00:41 You should be very grateful for what oil & gas has contibuted to your exchequer instead of making ill informed comments. Thanks to engineering progress, fields previously thought to be unviable are now very much viable. Lots more to come

"If you think that WTI is cheap... then consider for a moment what is happening in Canada these days where Western Canada Select crude trades below $16/barrel or a stunning $43 "discount" to WTI."
1112 2018-11-14 22:00:27 #ASSad.  He is their biggest oil buying customer. Google it

1118 2018-11-14 22:00:00 All of my experience in this world, my advice to you can be summed up in two words: 

Coconut oil.

Trust me on this one
1119 2018-11-14 21:59:58 Romero, Jimmy always put America first. How terrible!
Jimmy always refused dishonest backdoor deals.  How terrible!
Jimmy never caved to terrorism. How terrible!
Jimmy wanted us to get rid of our over dependence on foreign oil. How terrible!
Yes, Romero, you lied!

1124 2018-11-14 21:59:29 Meanwhile at border we have tens of thousands waiting entry, more than willing to do these jobs for even less than Americans make now, hundreds of thousands entering illegally every year taking construction jobs that would pay more if illegals weren't here
1125 2018-11-14 21:59:25 Alberta is oil's bitch. American oil companies ship our crude at a discount in Canada and sell it at world prices in the Gulf.
Canada needs refining capacity in order to sell a finished product.
1126 2018-11-14 21:59:09 I usually add lavender or rose oil but I’d never sleep with it on . Umqhamelo anganjani?
1127 2018-11-14 21:59:08 The first highway across the U.S. was funded by the big, evil major corporations (oil, tire, auto).  Bonds were used for other projects.  But once big brother started caring for the masses, taxes were the only way to continue the give aways.
1128 2018-11-14 21:58:42 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
1129 2018-11-14 21:58:41 Ditto agree with the cod liver oil  good luck. Hope u feel better soon

1133 2018-11-14 21:58:20 US message to the China on tech:   we won't let you take over our industries or advance your interests if they hurt ours

US message to rest of world on oil:  get the fuck out of the way suckers, we are going to export the crap out of our oil and destroy decades old markets

1135 2018-11-14 21:58:11 What an embarrasing sell out.  CBD oil is an absolute placebo load of shit.   Also a gateway drug.  What a fool.
1136 2018-11-14 21:57:58 Hi Donna, thanks for your concern. We use very small amounts of palm oil in our products, but even so, we’re committed to sourcing fully sustainable and traceable palm oil free from deforestation. Feel free to DM us if you want to know more.
1137 2018-11-14 21:57:57 Hot bath done now Olbus oil on, men’s baggy shirt and bed, hate feeling this shocking
1138 2018-11-14 21:57:56 よちよち
1139 2018-11-14 21:57:44 will keep raising the profile of palm oil and finding a sustainable source. Please do not think for one minute i want the fame and fortune as i really dont.. i want the awareness and living on the hope it will lead to many changes for palm oil, orangutans, the rainforest etc
1140 2018-11-14 21:57:43 I hate those kind of things because climate engineering is harmful for our immune system but big pharma profit from it same as the oil industry
1141 2018-11-14 21:57:28 I’m THE WORST at letting my gas run low and not getting my oil changed
1142 2018-11-14 21:57:25 Burning midnight oil
1143 2018-11-14 21:57:21 What does "sustainable" palm oil mean though? Other charities and NGOs have been failing to get any answers on that for ages,
Better to avoid #PalmOil altogether.
1144 2018-11-14 21:57:15 I don’t think I’ve shopped with #Iceland before in my life but their advert has made me seriously concerned about my palm oil consumption. Fucking good advertising that is.
1145 2018-11-14 21:57:14 My week has been punctuated with Olbas Oil baths and if that is better than the Sudafed spray I’ll be getting some of that!
1146 2018-11-14 21:57:10 Yes and getting antifreeze and oil
1147 2018-11-14 21:57:00 I hate waiting for oil changes
1148 2018-11-14 21:56:56 Yes it seems the communist oil companies want to ration oil supplies.. poor conservatives must be fainting..
1149 2018-11-14 21:56:46 Do you work on pickups? I need a rear main seal and oil pan gasket replaced.
1150 2018-11-14 21:56:44 A cod liver oil capsule a day helps keep colds at bay!  Hope you are soon feeling fighting fit!
1151 2018-11-14 21:56:41 siri how long can i go without an oil change without my car exploding
1152 2018-11-14 21:56:34 US strategic goal in Syria currently appears to be little more than oil theft & destabilization by funding terrorists you claim to fight.
1153 2018-11-14 21:56:30 Know your studies!  When you hear of a new study negating the value of a nutrient, find out who funded it!  Super healthy fish oil was attacked recently.  Fish oil is good for dry skin, dry eyes, your heart, fertility, etc!  Have a healthy night!
1154 2018-11-14 21:56:29 Yes, our Vita Coco Coconut Oil is cold-pressed and unrefined. Vita Coco Coconut Oil is made from certified organic coconuts and does not contain additives of any kind.  Our packaging is just different on the little bottles :)
1155 2018-11-14 21:56:28  no oil I will choke
1156 2018-11-14 21:56:24 Always wait until everyone is distracted then you sneak in the kitchen and gentle use fork to pick the meat, Don't forget to check of the oil dropped on the floor...put the meat in your mouth go to the bathroom seat down and chew ur meat..
1157 2018-11-14 21:56:21 There’s no better feeling than resetting that maintenance light after a way overdue oil change lol
1158 2018-11-14 21:56:18 Why is everything compared to oil companies. Wouldn’t surprise me if renewable energy companies have seen an increase in staff. Maybe we should follow them instead?
1159 2018-11-14 21:56:17 I'm genuinely curious to know how palm oil sourcing can be responsible?
1160 2018-11-14 21:55:51 Hes silent on the issue cause it was muslims that did the terrorizing! Jihadi Justine Trudope doesnt get oil money from Jews in order to spread Islam to create civil unrest in order to rush in the NWO! That's how I see it! Soros and his cronies have a plan.
1161 2018-11-14 21:55:37 If the nation's interest was in your heart you would see carbon pricing as a national purpose. We must incrementally move to a low-carbon economy, but we need the revenue from our oil shipped from tidewater to invest in new green infrastructure. Support the Feds #skpoli #cdnpoli
1162 2018-11-14 21:55:33 So you only oil your gears of capitalism with a LITTLE bit of the proletariat's blood? Is that what you're saying?
1163 2018-11-14 21:55:31 There’s nothing like the aroma of olbas oil and being in bed by 9:30 to reaffirm how much of a rockstar you really are! 
1164 2018-11-14 21:55:29 oil
1165 2018-11-14 21:55:29 When you get to Southern California, those of us w/ ties to the Interior would really appreciate seeing you actually getting your hands dirty, for once. Not in the way you normally do w/ Halliburton or the oil co's but let's say cold trailing at Rocketdyne, station 4 perhaps?
1166 2018-11-14 21:55:24 I hate sitting next to somebody with dreads in class and that damn oil they put in they dreads be strong asab

1170 2018-11-14 21:55:04 Yeah I remember in Dec 2015 when that was all the talk. 
"No worries, Christmas rally is coming, to... Wait nevermind, sell everything, we are in a correction, and you'll never see oil over $30/bbl again"
1171 2018-11-14 21:55:01 Okay while I do that you see which one comes first: pelosi uniting the party to pass a plan that'll keep warming under 2 degrees or raising the millions from the oil industry
1172 2018-11-14 21:55:01 Came in for an oil change... leave out with new brakes 
1173 2018-11-14 21:54:57 Go and shower with Goya oil
1174 2018-11-14 21:54:55 Stalinist forced collectivization was indeed a crime. Plenty of other successful voluntary cooperative endeavours. Many more historical examples of profits coming before human lives. This is more true today. Pharmaceuticals, Oil, Food and the Arms industry are but a few examples.
1175 2018-11-14 21:54:55 Me: I've been despondent as hell these past few days. Today, I'm gonna get my sunlight, go on a walk, take a long hot shower, wear my lavender oil, and hydrate!

Also me: I'm gonna take care of myself and make myself happy! I'm gonna watch The Hours!
1176 2018-11-14 21:54:39 The oil price is good for everything. When it goes up people scream how much it'll damage global spending power. When it goes down we're supposed to worry about the big oil producers getting no money anymore to be big spenders. It's ridiculous.
1177 2018-11-14 21:54:35 Tighter regs make exploration, development, and production more expensive, so they definitely affect oil/gas supply. As I keep saying, WE NEED TO DO BOTH! Make the industry pay its true costs and electrify everything to reduce oil/gas demand.
1178 2018-11-14 21:54:18 Oil and gas industries that negotiate complex international treaties? Are you Vladimir Putin?
1179 2018-11-14 21:54:06 Sauteed garlicky greens with a ton of oil and red peppers one of my fave things, but NOT IN THE POTATOES

Why is it so buttery
1181 2018-11-14 21:53:47 my wisdom tooth got removed!!! also i read sth about an oil company that was using carbon capturing (which i'd never heard of and it sounded promising!)
1182 2018-11-14 21:53:45 That has already begun.
1183 2018-11-14 21:53:45 Call me crazy, but this recipe isn't right. The half cup of olive oil is just wrong. There is no stock which means you are counting on the vegetables for all the moisture and salt is you are using the water from the lentils. I'd go back to the drawing board on this one.
1184 2018-11-14 21:53:38 Thankyouu ehh tja hahah dit filter lijkt t wel extra krullerig ofzo en dit is na t wassen. Gebruik shampoo voor pluizig haar van andrelon (oil & care vgm) en ook van andrelon ook spul voor pluizig haar haha wat je zeg maar niet uit hoeft te wassen of iets
1185 2018-11-14 21:53:37 US stocks have turned lower as Apple led a decline in tech stocks, offsetting early support from tame US consumer prices data  a rebound in oil prices. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 5 points higher 5,745. #ausshares #stockmarket

1193 2018-11-14 21:51:47 All our oil and gas revenue is going towards paying for Muskrat Falls and electricity rate subsidization(according to Dwight). Thanks to the previous PC government, we won’t exactly be rolling in cash anytime soon.
1194 2018-11-14 21:51:40 @CNBCClosingBell @JackieDeAngelis : #Oil: The US pumping out 11.6mbbl/day is proof that #Trump got a few shale producers to do what he was asking OPEC to do so price unexpectedly tumbled but excess capacity can get used up quickly & any cut could cause price to surge quickly!!
1195 2018-11-14 21:51:34 u think i have .79 cents just layin' qround? like some kind of oil baron?
1196 2018-11-14 21:51:31 For a nation standing on coal, surrounded by fish and oil we seem to have made a pretty good job of pissing it all away. #Brexit #BrexitDeal
1197 2018-11-14 21:51:26 In fairness, that example is N/A 
(Not applicable) b/c Trump has hired the most corrupt, incompetent group of ppl he could gather together.

DeVos —well, it’s Devos. 
So can’t use that group in data base.

1199 2018-11-14 21:51:14 A kale salad  with cranberries and a little olive oil.
1200 2018-11-14 21:51:09 Tighter regs (methane, water, etc) don't necessarily cut oil/gas supply, but keep focus on enviro and public health. I'm concerned that focus on supply per se could weaken campaigns to cut demand, create yet another Dem circular firing squad in 2020 & weaken Dems in swing states.
1201 2018-11-14 21:51:09 I'll buy anyone lunch if they go get my oil changed
1202 2018-11-14 21:50:55 Yes. Just like Big oil companies and car dealers.
1203 2018-11-14 21:50:53 Which oil are we going for then?
1204 2018-11-14 21:50:51 Can you imagine @BorisJohnson burning the midnight oil,  painstakingly going through the 585 page #WithdrawalAgreement with a fine tooth comb? Me neither. I bet the fucker has an opinion though

1208 2018-11-14 21:50:29 Gibson Energy Inc.,, announced that its Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per common share payable on January 17, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2018.

Gibson gets paid $25 a barrel to haul away heavy oil.

1213 2018-11-14 21:50:05 Well, your wrong. OPEC my cut production, but Sadia Arabia certainly are cutting oil production.

He is a snake oil salesman, exactly like DJT.

1245 2018-11-14 21:46:04 I think it's the thick by texture part that does the trick. It absorbs and/or hides oil build up. I think I get away with few washes mainly cos my hair is quite dry so it does the absorbing thing.

1322 2018-11-14 21:39:02 Another little change to try and make a difference. We’ve now got organic palm oil free hand soap in our bathroom. Definitely trying to make an effort to avoid palm oil!
1323 2018-11-14 21:39:01 Just an FYI, we have 12 yrs until our planet is inhabitable. We the People should sue oil companies because you’ve known for years the damage to the planet and humanity you’re doing.

1365 2018-11-14 21:35:12 It’s so hard . I just wish there was a solution . Someone said about like almond nut oil . Or maybe a man made product. I just think humans are too greedy, we take too much . And earth is doomed 
1366 2018-11-14 21:35:11 Concentrate on China! Why is the emissions increasing again? China of course, they increase by at least 5% this year, it´s a disaster, their “success” is based on fossil fuel, coal and oil and they still make major investments in these dirty industries.

1371 2018-11-14 21:34:48 I want love, unconditional. 
Murphy’s oil soap on hardwood floors and baseboards.
Scents of vanilla accompany me between hip swaying and finger snapping.
And singing aloud for the sheer pleasure of singing.
I’m happy.
So fucking happy. 
My joy is beaming.
1372 2018-11-14 21:34:46 Oil companies donate money to republicans, and they get tax breaks. It's the same thing.
1373 2018-11-14 21:34:40 Oil $ + some folks buying into fear + incumbent advantage + dodgy voting machines... I dunno, really.

It was always against the odds. But he changed minds, brought over many former GOP, & paved the way for progress. His contributions are significant.
1374 2018-11-14 21:34:39 Looking for tips on dealing with my eczema and everything is like "??? Prolly lather yourself with three kinds of organic oil and stop being stressed?? "

1376 2018-11-14 21:34:30 So the dentist office turned me away bc I brought my daughter with me. So I decided to go to the dealership and get my oil changed and they were booked up until Friday.

1378 2018-11-14 21:34:28 sick of seeing high frutose corn syrup, corn syrup and or soybean oil on the ingredients list on every fucking thing now!
1379 2018-11-14 21:34:22 ...indeed Pat! And plenty of oil, wood and coal! We seem to spend all our money on fuel of one sort or another!  But hey-ho, county living!
1380 2018-11-14 21:34:18 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
1381 2018-11-14 21:34:12 Yes I mentioned the oil price fall and softening in interest sensitive sectors
1382 2018-11-14 21:34:11 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.
成功の秘訣？ 早起きすること、遅くまで働くこと、油田を掘り当てることさ。
1383 2018-11-14 21:34:05 No it aint,they are trying to trade Fellani's hair for oil!
1384 2018-11-14 21:34:04 The Germans’ problem was that they had no focus. Too many objectives (Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev/Minsk pockets, oil fields) not enough troops. Thank God.
1385 2018-11-14 21:33:51 If Gibraltar, Cyprus or Northern Ireland had oil and unlimited renewable energy,  today's deals would have never been done. But Scotland. ..well, we're just a burden England loves to subsidise.

1391 2018-11-14 21:33:27 Oga if your sister is 50years and unmarried, won't you bath her with anointing oil. Haba! "NO" 50yrs can't be unmarried abeg. Even if she's unmarried she's a sugar mummy not a girlfriend abeg. Don't disturb me.
1392 2018-11-14 21:33:20 someone anyone please bless me with some olive oil
1393 2018-11-14 21:33:05 *Knocks over oil drum*

#VideoGameLogic
1394 2018-11-14 21:33:05 I understand your point, but fracking is causing a “lot” of our issues in the West! Climate change is real and the western states should be fighting tooth and nail to shut down big oil and mining interests before it’s too late. Of course it’ll be too late before most even care!
1395 2018-11-14 21:32:41 Olive oil iz the cigarettes of cooking — Covering every crime
1396 2018-11-14 21:32:24 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
1397 2018-11-14 21:32:12 Well if she tells us if it's the communist lovers, the anti oil members or the one who hates vetrans maybe we could narrow it down.
1398 2018-11-14 21:32:09 パンさんおはみらしずですー！
1399 2018-11-14 21:32:07 Production is at record high levels. If they ain't hiring now nothing will change that.

And again Alberta labourers don't get value for the oil companies resources. The oil companies do. 

There is no world market waiting for bitumen. Its a myth.
1400 2018-11-14 21:32:07 Oh, got it. I think Consumer Repots did 1 but not to that level. As I recall of course in fish you'll have mercury and PCB exposure. In OTC fish oil pills, most are mercury free but have trace amounts of PCBs. Vascepa has neither.
1401 2018-11-14 21:32:07 How is the oil pouring out of the jug if the oil in the jug is below the neck? I don’t think this will be that simple 
1402 2018-11-14 21:32:04 Alhamdulillah Allah tashemu lafiya
1403 2018-11-14 21:32:03 I like how you draw the facial expression and the anatomy is excellent, I really love the effect of oil on the body to make it look shiny
1404 2018-11-14 21:32:03 After the "ACRIM gap" gate, the IPCC focuses on "measurement of consensus". And pardon me, that is like Christians proving existence of God by consensus. 
"See we all agree!"
This is no longer a science, this is a "shared belief" in my eyes.
(P.S. I do not own oil company :-)
1405 2018-11-14 21:32:03 A very very good move by the school authorities... I commend their efforts for this
1406 2018-11-14 21:31:48 Absolutely not original, but for Canada specifically, it's the best idea I know of to really have a shot at influencing the real producers. The main argument as you know is "Ok, we stop using oil, and switch to what?!?" Developing the what is paramount, as we all know the why.
1407 2018-11-14 21:31:46 Perhaps its time for a climate change protest and descending on Grangemouth. We cannae be stopped protesting oil barons ruining the planet. I wouldnt imagine it would hurt the UK economy anyway, cos its fucking worthless apparantly
1408 2018-11-14 21:31:46 Omg temp. has droped down to 16 outside with howling winds!Thanks hubby for getting oil today to keep warm.
1409 2018-11-14 21:31:45 All I will say is do your research. Coconut oil has great benefits for your hair. Idk about skin tho.
1410 2018-11-14 21:31:34 Not at all
1411 2018-11-14 21:31:34 the sun doesn't shine at night, nor is it windy all day long, I have a way that uses a waste 24/7, that is almost free this waste is more abundant than oil,globally. no need for a giant battery!
1412 2018-11-14 21:31:32 that's exactly it. It needs fundamental change, recent EU laws take one step forward (by making companies list palm oil even if derivates are used). Next step is to use only sustainable sources, then ban if not working. Just hope UK maintain same protections after Br**it
1413 2018-11-14 21:31:32 @realDonaldTrump   You are a character out of an old Western movie plopped on us in the 21st century - a snake oil salesman. Hype, extreme exaggeration, boastfullness, and lies. An academy award winning snake oil salesman.
1414 2018-11-14 21:31:22 I was so ready for my man to leave to the oil field now I’m counting down the days to see him again 
1415 2018-11-14 21:30:57 No.  They have S-400s & nukes.  They'll do what the EU tried to do in the link i gave you.  Pushed too far, they'll say "We & China value gold at 500 barrels per oz for Russian, Iranian, Venezuelan oil, & for Chinese goods."  

They'll have all the USD liquidity they need.
1416 2018-11-14 21:30:56 wait until they find out how much oil is in mayonnaise!
1417 2018-11-14 21:30:54 Allah Sarki maza, Nasrun Minallah
1418 2018-11-14 21:30:50 Y’all don’t get tired of using lotion to Jack off? Use vegetable oil 
1419 2018-11-14 21:30:47 If this technology is so good will you push for radical cuts in the HMRC budget to protect borders and import standards? Or do you know on some level that this is snake oil?
1420 2018-11-14 21:30:42 Also try castor oil treatments they rehydrate your hair and make it grow suuuuper fast
1421 2018-11-14 21:30:36 All this is from a politicial class which largely backburnered nuclear energy, did nothing to buck Chinese coal or OPEC oil production, and had relatively few issues with the effects of overpopulation in the Global South on fossil fuels usage.
1422 2018-11-14 21:30:36 No economy can run on a single industry forever. Lack of previous governments foresight into growing beyond oil and gas has set us back.

Also American now surpasses all countries in oil prod.
1425 2018-11-14 21:30:22 Where is my muthafucking thc oil?
1426 2018-11-14 21:30:17 I voted. Hehe. Can't wait to see the final results. Love your wonderful polls as always "Oil Tot"! Hugs.

1428 2018-11-14 21:30:17 EZ shares -0.6%, US shares -0.8% with another volatile session as mkt again couldn’t hold on to early gains.

1429 2018-11-14 21:30:08 Well, if it had any dairy products or fish oil in it, it also wouldn't be vegan. The opposite of vegan isn't "meat"--it's any animal product. Most white glue is made from animals, so if you're a serious vegan, you need to look for vegan glue. Doesn't mean you plan to eat it.
1430 2018-11-14 21:30:03 Some hot fry oil to the face would have ended this a lot faster
1431 2018-11-14 21:29:37 Full disclosure my wife is an Amarin rep.  the only Drs that have said anything about the mineral oil are the ones that own the stock.

1434 2018-11-14 21:29:20 I be doing that but this new body oil I be using says best use when skin is damp so I be half dry .
1435 2018-11-14 21:29:13 All I have been saying
1436 2018-11-14 21:29:06 Dont forget : what you label revenue with one hand is an expense on the other: that'show accounting works.  Those are the dollars of Canadian households and businesses ending up in the hands of oil companies.
1437 2018-11-14 21:29:02 I'm still complaining. I get my oil and petrol from a Sligo garage and they gave me one lousy stamp on my loyalty card when I spent €50 9 stamps gets a free shite coffee
1438 2018-11-14 21:29:02 Has nobody noticed what a mess the stock market is, and where the economy is actually headed. Tell signs, oil down dollar up. It’s a mess and the market is deteriorating because of @realDonaldTrump policies. And now @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats are piling on too.
1439 2018-11-14 21:28:54 "eco terrorism" is a Harper Conservative construct. Environmentalists are not Daesh! Subsidies unnecessary. They've received billions over decades and have billions to invest in refineries yet choose not to. 1/2 of AB's oil is not discounted as majors are integrated in the Gulf.
1440 2018-11-14 21:28:52 Russia is playing with fire doing that and they will pay with USDRUB > 100 and 20-30% inflation while they will have to sell gold to stabilise their currency when it will be reaching 800$... while oil prices 20$... You will remind my words.
1441 2018-11-14 21:28:31 Is Subaru doesn’t hurry up with this oil change
1442 2018-11-14 21:28:29 Peanut Shrimp: Add 1/4 pinches of sunflower oil, 3/4 squirts of butter & 1/3 pinches of ground beef to a plate. Stir with knife and enjoy!
1443 2018-11-14 21:28:25 Avocado oil is good to strimuate your body or what ever

1446 2018-11-14 21:27:52 Aussie shares are expected to edge higher at the open after a mixed day in Wall St. Oil bounced. The US listed shares Rio Tinto were 2.1% lower in late trade in NY. The $AUD turned higher. Volatility continues to keep investors and traders on edge. $RZI #ASX #Australia #fintech
1447 2018-11-14 21:27:48 If only our Arewa ppl can be this influential rather than the retrogressive unending drama and envy.

1449 2018-11-14 21:27:45 Unfortunately some of the companies they list in the sustainable palm oil also but from the bad palm oil companies. They list cadbury's and mars
1450 2018-11-14 21:27:45 Just wait for the oil to collapse how they will be selling gold ... as USDRUB will skyrocket same as inflation in 2014 and gold will tumble.
1451 2018-11-14 21:27:41 The Dow closed down 206 points Wednesday. Apple lost another 3% on iPhone demand concerns. U.S. oil prices rose 1%, snapping a record 12-day losing streak. BU-98WE
1452 2018-11-14 21:27:41 Can they just leave the rooftop bar “naked” and say the rainforest has been cleared for palm oil production and, if you don’t like it then you’re just supporting the globalist rape of the environment. 
(now give me my money!)

1455 2018-11-14 21:27:38 Really? ‘Scotland’ owns the oil and the whisky. And there I was thinking that the oil companies own the oil and Diageo and other companies own the whisky. You are saying that is wrong? Evidence?

1462 2018-11-14 21:27:01 here's my late night cooking advice... add a little toasted sesame oil to any dish made with tahini for a more intense and nuanced sesame flavour...

If we weren’t subsidising england we would’ve been cut loose years ago
1481 2018-11-14 21:25:41 I am sure he ploughed in millions but unfortunately together with the naieve recruitment he wasnt Abramhovic or a Dubai oil multi billionaire. I am thankful for the infrastructure though.

1494 2018-11-14 21:24:56 Melissa, could you still have pizza with an olive oil or alfredo sauce? No tomatoes! :)
1495 2018-11-14 21:24:52 The Liberals consider this a win! Afraid they dont care what you think Brad! Sad days ahead for Canadians when we have environmentalists running the show! Funniest part is the Trudeau family made their fortune from oil and now JT hates it!
1496 2018-11-14 21:24:48 A little mineral oil will help with really bad constipation. Be prepared for it to lead to a very full diaper though lol.
1497 2018-11-14 21:24:47 Try covering it in oil (baby oil, coconut oil, olive oil, etc) before taking it off! This will help :)
1498 2018-11-14 21:24:46 Omg I am breaking into a friend’s present I can’t take this anymore I am out of CBD oil, have $20 til Friday & my deadbeat sister quit her job & my parents are going to be so upset & stressed I want absolutely 0 interactions with anyone in this house

1500 2018-11-14 21:24:26 Bout to hand-brew a thick black coffee dark as an oil slick to get my machine running for the second part of the day Everything works by hand-crank in my body
1501 2018-11-14 21:24:19 I think Trumps  agrees with that, two differences he has got with those  pushing for just green energy is the fact that those challenging America  out there with energy are not using green energy but oil. Many live in  energy illusions regarding global reality on energy&politics
1502 2018-11-14 21:24:16 طيب وش الضمان انه طور سيناء !!
1503 2018-11-14 21:24:08 Yes, oil and gas industry. You?

1506 2018-11-14 21:23:53 is it because coconut oil doesn’t give moisture? like if your hair is dry it’s not going to give it moisture just sit on it? Idk if I’m thinking about it right lol
1507 2018-11-14 21:23:49 @ENERGY reduce oil production by -1m barrels/day

current situation is not responsible.
1508 2018-11-14 21:23:49 Yes,  I'm an amrnite from 2011.  I've seen the x oz of fish/35 capsules of fish oil  per day to... for years, but it always stops at that;  it never covers exposure to mercury, DHA/AA, oxidized oils, expense, calories, gastric issues etc.  Anybody done that?

1512 2018-11-14 21:23:25 I thought that was a protein/coconut oil sensitivity thing rather than it being bad for the hair.
1513 2018-11-14 21:23:16 And than said Pelosi has a history of activism and would appreciate them being there

She should have called out Pelosi gor being corrupt as fuck and bought off by Pharma Oil and War!

But this is a win?

National mic used to say Pelosi is awesome

1518 2018-11-14 21:22:34 Mix few drops of tea tree oil with your daily fascial wash it’s really good for acne because it has antibacterial effect.
1519 2018-11-14 21:22:27 Cbd oil? My wife loves it. Hope it really does help you. Prescription pills are a death sentence.
1520 2018-11-14 21:22:23 And you wonder why jobs in the patch are low while production is at record highs and oil and gas companies are making huge profits.

Great job cheering against labour and Alberta jobs Jason...ugh

1524 2018-11-14 21:22:10 Does it bother the oil beetle?
1525 2018-11-14 21:21:53 Snake oil excites more. Fish oil can be turned into snake oil by oil barons. Any oil, actually, if well-oiled. Any thing actually - oil or otherwise.
1526 2018-11-14 21:21:41 I said a prayer for you. Have you ever looked into CBD oil? It helped me a lot and a lot of people I know have said the same.

1530 2018-11-14 21:21:23 @HunterZThompson the thing with pickle juice is possibly the properties, Vinegar which has astringent values & oil for pores, the possibility of 'clearing & increase flow of blood to the pores' may be a benefit in some sort of way?? but what do I know =D

1532 2018-11-14 21:21:08 The price of oil per barrel is still dropping for the 8 month straight and still the government is increasing the price of fuel in Kenya.
1533 2018-11-14 21:21:06 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
1534 2018-11-14 21:21:04 Thanks babe. I’m already using both coconut oil and Jamaican black castor oil. I need to find someone who’ll do the threading on my hair. It’s so long but the shrinkage is ghastly.
1535 2018-11-14 21:21:00 Get some beard oil or beard balm ! Will help big time
1536 2018-11-14 21:21:00 Its only Africans who buy anointing oil for protection from a pastor who has 7 bodyguards.
1537 2018-11-14 21:20:53 Gotta admit, a great idea.  Not exactly original, however.  BP was likely the first oil company to advocate it...back in 2000.  Too bad BP dropped the ball too few others thought it worth retrieving.  It's other industries that have surged ahead into renewables.

If it was Macedonian rice I would be with you bc the Slavs like to overcook it and add like 10 cups of oil but other cultures make such tasty rice dishes
1546 2018-11-14 21:20:00 burning the midnight oil again & i’m high on caffeine and tinkies. i’m way up, i feel blessed.
1547 2018-11-14 21:19:48 cauli rice is meh. get the cauli gnocchi. cook it in a tbs of oil and don't add water like they say. it'll get crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. it's so fire makes me so angry

get the brie and they have these fig and olive crisps that are perfect as crackers
1548 2018-11-14 21:19:43 Going on the pill called ‘Yasmin ‘ helped massively with my skin, tea tree oil face wash and tea tree oil itself is good at drying out the spots. Also acnicide gel is good, also try witch hazel! Drink plenty of water and always wash your face morning and night!! Hope this helps x
1549 2018-11-14 21:19:38 Which Fish oil and krill oil brands do you suggest?
1550 2018-11-14 21:19:37 Who is "we"?  I don't own an oil company. They need to reduce production and/or build more refineries.

We have already let the industry build enormous amounts of specialized infrastructure on our land. Enough is enough. 

And we need to reduce fossil fuels over all not increase
1551 2018-11-14 21:19:28 I know she uses coconut oil and black castor oil to moisturize. To stretch,she uses the African threading method
1552 2018-11-14 21:19:28 I leave Friday & I have nothing packed & need an oil change.
1553 2018-11-14 21:19:23 I could tell him but what's the point. I could explain about oil markets and what Norway did but he hasn't a clue. Oil brought in total, total that is, since 1960s £408bn. Currently its 1.2bn and declining. Norway on the other hand has bigger fields and sold peak oil at peak mkt

1559 2018-11-14 21:18:55 Yes I actually have. But I think it’s because they contain specific ingredients that do something, like Argan oil.
1560 2018-11-14 21:18:47 Olive oil and baby shampoo works super well
1561 2018-11-14 21:18:39 these stupid fuckers are going to get us all killed with their "oh we have to study the problem some more" bullshit. 

take the oil, and leave it all in the ground, then adjust society so we can deal with not having it anymore. thats what we have to do.

1567 2018-11-14 21:17:47 You know those goofy internet quizzes where you answer questions to see what kind of flower, movie star, pasta dish, etc. you are? Took one to determine which car I am. Seems I'm an old Toyota Land Cruiser with 380K miles that leaks oil and needs a paint job and new tires.
1568 2018-11-14 21:17:44 @weirdmedicine you guys should do a show where you talk about CBD oil

1570 2018-11-14 21:17:29 So you want to board the Mediterranean diet train. To start, begin cooking your meals in olive oil instead of butter. Load up on fruits and vegetables, and try to limit your protein consumption to salmon, sardines, eggs, and pulses. Lastly, avoid processed food.

1599 2018-11-14 21:14:53 @CadburyUK when are you going to do the decent thing & stop supporting the deforestarion of the world & the extinction of orangoutangs? Stop buying & using palm oil.

1607 2018-11-14 21:14:26 Does Pres. Trump want oil prices to go up to help US oil companies, or does he want oil prices to go down to help US consumers?  Maybe both.  Too low  prices will force many companies out of biz & into bankruptcy (BK).  Too high oil prices will force many consumers into debt & BK
1608 2018-11-14 21:14:23 Use lemon (help burn the excess fat/oil) and also aloe vera (help smoothen the face and help remove the black spots gradually)
1609 2018-11-14 21:14:16 Is that why we have @realdonaldtrump as our President?  His habitat was taken for a palm oil plantation.  SAD.
1610 2018-11-14 21:14:09 And then I put on this oil called “everyday oil”. My life is so much easier. Traveling is so much easier. And my wallet is smiling. Bless.

1626 2018-11-14 21:12:54 How about a tax increase on the 1% and corporate profits? How about a decrease in military spending? How about seizing the assets of convicted white collar frauds and Wall Street swindlers? How about Federal funding for education and clean energy instead of bail outs for big oil?

1638 2018-11-14 21:11:51 Well done, & good on, Iceland for continuing to highlight the problems of palm oil. Top work by Icelands Managing Director, Richard Walker. #HumanityMustEvolve #ImproveSociety #PlayYourPart
1639 2018-11-14 21:11:49 A man knows who his heart belongs to . So you can cook his food in diamond oil & do backflips on his dick but if it ain’t you then it ain’t you .
1640 2018-11-14 21:11:42 Ah yes, the 'you-need-us-to-protect-that-for-you-because-Russia' argument. It's hilarious. The eejits still don't get it that Scotland likely won't remain in the UK long after any Brexit. So the oil and gas is no longer theirs to bargain with.
1641 2018-11-14 21:11:41 いやまた一から書き直すけど！！！！！！！30分間の努力が無駄になった 悲しい
1642 2018-11-14 21:11:30 We can dream on for sure.Even when oil prices hit record lows our fuel prices remained high.
1643 2018-11-14 21:11:30 He’s not a politician, he’s a snake oil salesman.
1644 2018-11-14 21:11:28 Al aire de #ElComodorenseRadio el fiscal Juan Carlos Caperochipi, por investigación al juez  Gustavo Toquier en la causa de OIL Combustibles
1645 2018-11-14 21:11:22 Not every type of sales position requires a "snake oil" or pushy sales pitch. The way technology has evolved has actually helped sales, they have already price shopped, if they are at a retail location they want you to educate them. But I get it isnt for everyone
1646 2018-11-14 21:11:18 え、あの、書いてた感想文消えたんだけど泣いていいか？
1647 2018-11-14 21:11:03 I need an oil change bruh
1648 2018-11-14 21:11:01 je vous rappelle que e gaz oil est toujours moins taxé que l'essence et que les utilisateurs du diesel  ont bénéficie d'une niche fiscale pendant des années! Faut arrêter ce poujadisme Zohra, pas vous mince!
1649 2018-11-14 21:10:59 I think the majority of Western Canada and East coast sure, however the problem lays with our tyrant corrupt PM and his cabinet of clowns that believe that Canadians want a stagnate economy which is being across the country. Move oil work with provinces!
1650 2018-11-14 21:10:54 You are an oil engineer
1651 2018-11-14 21:10:45 Maybe a positive Oil inventory Tomorrow could lead to a bounce?
1652 2018-11-14 21:10:42 lol at everyone getting all “woke” about palm oil, yet still continue to contribute to the meat industry every single day 
1653 2018-11-14 21:10:40 i wanted to see what would happen. its just frozen oil lol. i licked it and it doesnt really have a taste :(
1654 2018-11-14 21:10:36 No I lived in PR and guns are banned there. The murder rate has reached 2900 per year. So when ever anyone talks about common sense gun laws I see them as snake oil salesmen. Punishment to the law abiding citizens has never decreased crime.
1655 2018-11-14 21:10:33 Here is the NO vision:

Dear Policians, 

Until you figure out how to build pipelines, close the oil discount gap, and bring back foreign investment, there will be no expensive photo opps and crooked deals for you to hand out.

Signed,

Calgary "No" Voters.
1656 2018-11-14 21:10:30 I did it. I actually poured straight olive oil down my throat to do the last chapter but every scrap of Iron Dragon 2 is recorded and will be edited before bedtime.

1666 2018-11-14 21:09:40 I want an oil field job  I needs money
1667 2018-11-14 21:09:36 Check out MXC for super low float oil/gas. Usually little volume, a lot of buys right before 4.
1668 2018-11-14 21:09:35 I’m with you there. Started a long time ago. SAY NO TO PALM OIL. 
1669 2018-11-14 21:09:35 It is, isn't it? 

It was the same thing with the Corexit and BP oil spill in the Gulf. 

We got a state of the art brand new cancer center built on New Orleans' hospital row 2 years after.
1670 2018-11-14 21:09:09 Even JV cash calls were not paid. The IOCs only kept production going because of high oil prices and hope/confidence that they will eventually be paid. It was a real house of cards!
1671 2018-11-14 21:08:56 well you know how sometimes you freeze water? imagine that except its olive oil instead
1672 2018-11-14 21:08:54 2 teaspoons of castor oil & cod liver oil is all you need not to get sick.... Ask y’all grannies.
1673 2018-11-14 21:08:44 Will that include Canadian NGas and Oil Sands crude @JustinTrudeau and @gmbutts?  Alberta is banking on it.
1674 2018-11-14 21:08:40 I though I would try @LidlUK today but was incredibly disappointing when the first item I picked up had palm oil listed as an ingredient. Still worse was that the box pronounced 'new recipe'. I'll shop elsewhere thanks!  #PalmOil #Outoftouchwithcustomers

also me: omg why is my skin so bad
1678 2018-11-14 21:08:19 Im in total agreement. We can bring the UK to a stop in one fell swoop by shutting down Grangemouth. What will they fund the country wi then. The bad oil, whit a scoop that would be
1679 2018-11-14 21:08:10 Thank God for CBD oil on days like this
1680 2018-11-14 21:08:09 Ya Allah ka saukar da n'imah a wannan garinmu na Lagos, the heat is just too much
1681 2018-11-14 21:08:09 It can dry down so I usually mix in a drop of facial oil and it’s the perfect consistency. I hope they’re helpful at the Bobbi counter!
1682 2018-11-14 21:08:06 @sainsburys can you confirm whether or not the palm oil used  in your own brand products is sustainable?
1683 2018-11-14 21:07:58 Me too, it’s the best life. Red wine from the bodega and Frieixenet at €4 a bottle. The tomato & olive oil on toast is to die for as well!

1687 2018-11-14 21:07:38 Don't see anything new - my guess is $USDCAD after that trade comment and the oil sell off
1688 2018-11-14 21:07:29 You need an oil change tomorrow
1689 2018-11-14 21:07:28 This CBD oil is lit 
1690 2018-11-14 21:07:17 hey quick question what the FUCK is an olive oil iced cube
1691 2018-11-14 21:07:15 Go wit that cookin oil I'm spottin there to zim there is shortage of it...and that document on the bed those words look like "uhlelo lwesindebele" yini sis?@MboMahocs 
1692 2018-11-14 21:07:11 I need an oil change lol
1693 2018-11-14 21:07:06 Pele ooo add palm oil and onions 
1694 2018-11-14 21:07:04 Great to see that fancy new crossrail station on the Apprentice. Paid for by Scotland's tax and oil subsidy to the south of England. #indyref2
1695 2018-11-14 21:06:59 I oil my scalp after I wash and before I moisturize and I massage it into the scalp, you can use any essential oil you’d like, I use a mixture of coconut, castor and jojoba oil
1696 2018-11-14 21:06:45 Ironically it may not be necessary.   The price of crude oil has dropped and the Rand has firmed slightly in the last few weeks.
1697 2018-11-14 21:06:42 I only smoke oil but I prefer indica based
1698 2018-11-14 21:06:15 I’m gonna smell like lavender for the next couple weeks because I’m coating myself in essential oil to keep my shit together and not flip out
1699 2018-11-14 21:06:13 MBS wanted oil at $85 a barrel, Kashogghi murder weakened him, may end him, and day Kashogghi is killed oil starts a 30% selloff.  might just be a coincidence, but there is no question is was a big part of the risk off sentiment and nobody mentions it why i pointed it out to you
1700 2018-11-14 21:06:12 I hate getting a oil change, they be tryna tell you everything that’s wrong like relaaaaax I just want my oil changed
1701 2018-11-14 21:06:03 BLACK SEED OIL is THE ONE
1702 2018-11-14 21:06:00 I can't believe I'm doing aromatherapy rn
If this thyme oil cures my pneumonia I'm the queen of fuckin England
1703 2018-11-14 21:05:49 وهل رحمة الله مرهونة بالصلاة عليه وكل شئ فى قبضته سبحانه
1704 2018-11-14 21:05:41 Nobody is lobbies me.  Why?  Because I cut 95% of the fuel out.  Think an oil company is going to like what I am doing???  No, they will go bankrupt.  So, why not find me your rich CO2 buddies, we have lunch and set up a company all up board to get it done.  Easy enough, right?
1705 2018-11-14 21:05:40 class action seems more direct - and there's even documentation.  The oil companies have been doing research on climate for decades.  They knew.  

Possibility to shut down fossil fuels AND get the money for climate action.

At the least it's great press.
1706 2018-11-14 21:05:31 Generation/storage/transmission will all continue improving. The batteries of today are way better on a $/kWh basis than 20 years ago. Energy for stable value storage won't work because breakthroughs are unpredictable and will devalue investment. Feel bad for whale oil longs.
1707 2018-11-14 21:05:27 Has nobody noticed what a mess the stock market is, and where the economy is actually headed. Tell signs, oil down dollar up. It’s a mess and the market is deteriorating because of @realDonaldTrump policies. And now @HouseDemocrats @TheDemocrats are piling on too.
1708 2018-11-14 21:05:27 I’m clearly slacking on my nutrition  what is black seed oil used for?

1710 2018-11-14 21:05:08 now my oil change is $80 & it came w/ a 2019 loaner car... Mmm.. Fancy #BMWClub 
1711 2018-11-14 21:05:08 Really??!! If they are, what of seizing there personal estates?! For example, let assume capital oil is worthless, I don’t think ifeanyi Ubah is worthless.
1712 2018-11-14 21:05:08 Ah, maybe that's because your country is the 1 which has control; and our country is the 1 that is shown disrespect. Glad I didn't upset u. (It is true though about Lon. It was a mess for many years after the 2nd World War. Oil is very important, hence WM not wanting to let us go
1713 2018-11-14 21:05:08 "nationalize Amazon" is "nationalize oil and natural gas" bt for tech. quit it.
1714 2018-11-14 21:05:02 How’s oil today?
1715 2018-11-14 21:05:00 Hey @PepsiCo, I can’t stand by brands that use #ConflictPalmOil. Demand responsible palm oil from your suppliers and eliminate rainforest destruction and human rights and labor abuses from your products.
1716 2018-11-14 21:04:58 Ruddy palm oil
1717 2018-11-14 21:04:42 The Fatherland Card is yesterday's news.

Now its all about that fake crypto-currency called Petro. 

To put it simple, it is a bond for future oil extractions, used as a fiat currency for daily transcations to ease the use of US dollars within the government.
1718 2018-11-14 21:04:35 #Diesel_exhaust Kills. # nairobi is chocking from motor emissions!
Diesel oil has more than 30 components that can cause cancer, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
1719 2018-11-14 21:04:24 @realDonaldTrump I thought our petroleum production was up and oil prices had dropped. Then why are gasoline prices VERY high? Are we increasing production so we can ship more to other countries without helping our own citizens first? Us older people on fixed incomes need help.
1720 2018-11-14 21:04:23 And it looks like you want to buy you're oil from Saudi Arabia what a joke don't worry our new fruitcake governor will be raising prices on gas just wait and see.
1721 2018-11-14 21:04:18 Just yourself & a fab outfit. And maybe some love oil. And a cannabis candle.
1722 2018-11-14 21:04:12 As the Minister of Environment Shannon Philips says “An action a day keeps global capitalism away! “. I think most will agree that phrase includes pipelines and Alberta oil.    #Leapmanifestomuch?
1723 2018-11-14 21:04:09 Cadburys with all that lovely palm oil?
1724 2018-11-14 21:04:02 Working towards that list is the only way progress of any type will be made.

That, and for the oil industry to be the ones to profit from clean-energy...
1725 2018-11-14 21:04:01 @Beatlebaby64 @jenniferkrneta @Bren05_ @Lautergeist So @anniefreyshow is so into the Christmas spirit she's sweating pine oil.
1726 2018-11-14 21:03:52 $440 on tires, alignment & oil change. I’m sick
1727 2018-11-14 21:03:42 What a crock! Corporate welfare?!  NFL teams & MLB teams do the same thing.  Amazon is not holding out its hand. They are actively gaining advantage from politicians who wish to sell their electorate snake oil in the form of jobs. The optics work in a way the economics don't.
1728 2018-11-14 21:03:30 No, it was not "booming" - check the stats.  Moreover, the point made was that neither Abbott nor Cruz had anything to do with why it has lately spiked.  That is directly tied to the oil boom.  Fact matter.  And it's "initiatives" not "inilalves."
1729 2018-11-14 21:03:28 let me find out you use pink oil and blue magic
1730 2018-11-14 21:03:22 What has happened in reality is the reverse of what you suggest, the alternatives have been replaced with cheaper palm oil.  Pure greed.  I can remember when Cadbury's used milk.

1736 2018-11-14 21:02:46 2) the west coast of France & use the Mediterranean route to reach Israel! No doubt hoping that Israel would lose the war! Israel prevailed & the oil embargoes began! Never underestimate the perfidy of France! Since then Europe barely lifts a finger for Israel! The left worse!

1758 2018-11-14 21:00:37 WTI Crude Oil +0.8% at 56.14 bbl $USO
Gold +0.7% at 1210.20 oz $GLD
Copper +0.7% at 2.71 lb  $CU
1759 2018-11-14 21:00:34 If we could get the oil to markets that pay undiscounted prices, I would hazard a pretty strong guess the degree of subsidies would not be necessary. Alberta and Saskatchewan have to attract business interest somehow. The cost of fighting back on eco terrorism is significant.
1760 2018-11-14 21:00:32 3d. #Orthorexia refers to an unhealthy obsession w/eating food arbitrarily labeled as being healthy.

1765 2018-11-14 21:00:05 I seen vegetable oil 
1766 2018-11-14 21:00:04 OMG! Not a new idea! gop are all on the take from Big oil including fake president! That IS where to focus! VOTES! The GREEDY, CORRUPT,LIEING gop MUST BE VOTED OUT!!!
1767 2018-11-14 21:00:02 "Use both bribery and threats to exterminate every Cossack to a man if they set fire to the oil in Guriev." - Vladimir Lenin
1768 2018-11-14 21:00:00 I need to catch my breath in life, especially not full of oil.
1769 2018-11-14 20:59:55 Nah go sooner don’t ruin your engine. Lol RT @rarebre3d: I need an oil change bad! Maybe Sunday
1770 2018-11-14 20:59:42 If u have qon a free soap sample or come to me oil and have not got it yet please inbox me and let me know. I will resend a sample out tomorrow thanks
1771 2018-11-14 20:59:42 A good day is when bitcoin steals the "crashing" headlines and Mr. Fisher says the worst in crude oil prices is over.
1772 2018-11-14 20:59:40 Let me finish the oil for you
1773 2018-11-14 20:59:38 Trying using essential oils(peppermint or eucalyptus), CBD oil, and turmeric
1774 2018-11-14 20:59:36 Yes im burning the midnight oil also
1775 2018-11-14 20:59:30 Is CO2 a conspiracy to you?  Why then no solutions?  Conspiracy?  Evil oil cartels?  Clearly 95% of the fuel can be eliminated.  Why can't the NWO solve this?  Conspiracy?  What gives?  Please, take off the tin hat and get real.  Find solutions like I have.  Wake up.
1776 2018-11-14 20:59:29 Those are the pH champions. Also tried others which made little or no effect, so kids could see that some are neutral or don't even mix: oil (no effect), milk (very slightly acid), pineapple juice (acid), egg white (slightly basic) and whatever the kids wanted to try
1777 2018-11-14 20:59:28 Interesting that most palm oil/kernel is used to feed livestock. And there is so many people posting it who I know eat meat/consume dairy. So to reduce the most as possible you should go vegan. But no you couldn’t possibly do that... #palmoil
1778 2018-11-14 20:59:23 Sure oil and gas companies must have given him over 10 million in campaign contributions over his governorship because they liked his new glasses.
1779 2018-11-14 20:59:18 They are not your neighbours you share the same land..or used to until you threw people out of homes they had lived in for a century or more.
I do not suppose the $Billioins worth of Oil/Gas laying offshore Gaza has anything to do with the situation?
1780 2018-11-14 20:59:17 I don't get on with lush, I prefer @FaithInNature  or traditional olive oil soaps like savion de Marseille
1781 2018-11-14 20:59:17 I wrote my way IN - this momma is a professional writer who burned the midnight oil on a freelance project to buy the kiddos #hamilton tix for Christmas. Any chance we can get a shout out for the big reveal? @leslieodomjr @Lin_Manuel @DaveedDiggs @ReneeGoldsberry @ChrisisSingin
1782 2018-11-14 20:59:10 HOLY SHIT ITS HE i lost acnl again dude bukc SIR please give me peri EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume
1783 2018-11-14 20:59:01 I’d love to help you apply some oil sometime. 
1784 2018-11-14 20:58:57 I'm partial to a couple of spaghetti dishes that are pretty easy to do. One you slice some cherry or grape tomatoes in half and put them with garlic and olive oil and roast them in the oven, then mix them in with some spaghetti noodles. Can put meatballs with it or go meatless.
1785 2018-11-14 20:58:52 @CadburyUK rethink your use of palm oil. You have a huge responsibility as a market leader to set the standard for acceptable behaviour towards our environment.
1786 2018-11-14 20:58:51 Wheezing is no good.
You need to place the Chonky Chunk medicinal oil on your shoulders, leg and toes for the Limpy Goo to appear and heal your soul for the Heavens to greet you, where the Gods of portable kernel corns come in to celebrate your arrival with poptarts and a Plop.
1787 2018-11-14 20:58:49 I've survived three surgeries for endometriosis in the last 1.5 years, been promoted to a manager position at work, successfully fixed two major oil leaks in my car with help from a friend and my sisters, and my writing is on track for two new releases in May of 2019. #conquer
1788 2018-11-14 20:58:49 Gold diggers dig until they find oil
1789 2018-11-14 20:58:44 1) DNC backed off commitment 2refuse fossilfuel donations. 2) ORourke & Heitkamp in the top 10 for Oil&Gas campaign donations. 3) Many in Dem leadership support fracking.  4) Dem Party+DAPL=empty set. Even Dems who support EPs lack the courage to stand up. Silence is Complicity.
1790 2018-11-14 20:58:40 #Canada’s oil sector is divided over whether to force a temporary cut to production, with some major producers pushing the controversial idea in a bid to ease a supply glut and halt a steep plunge in prices

BBG #OOTT
1791 2018-11-14 20:58:39 I don buy my bottle of olive oil sef.
1792 2018-11-14 20:58:39 when oil is 2 high,Russian oil co's forget abt domestic fuel market and start to export like crazy. So there is a need for gov intervention either to put domestic production level in % of TTL/impose higher exp tariffs. Gasoline price is rising domestically despite high production
1793 2018-11-14 20:58:33 Nothing quite like the first chapped lips of the winter season. My face is DRINKING  coconut oil.
1794 2018-11-14 20:58:23 Britain should also #Brexit out of the oil rich lands in Syria as well  I'm just playing calm your tenga
1795 2018-11-14 20:58:18 @JenBriney this doesnt discourage me from thinking it's a good idea. but I 100% think if the shoe drops and America shifts away from gas and oil we need to be prepared for some crazy ex girlfriend spiteful fuel costs from the energy sector.they will pass any costs onto consumers.
1796 2018-11-14 20:58:15 Thanks CBD Oil - K Guzman for the follow!
1797 2018-11-14 20:58:03 I swear if Kassi dont stop trying to sell me weed oil im gonna die
1798 2018-11-14 20:57:54 Would it help if I ate cat food?  Will I become more limber?  Right now I am like the Tin man in the Wizard of Oz.  I would appreciate some olive oil about now!
1799 2018-11-14 20:57:51 Happy you have gotten relief from CBD oil!
1800 2018-11-14 20:57:49 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
1801 2018-11-14 20:57:41 Use a little coconut oil on the ends
1802 2018-11-14 20:57:40 Unbelievably devastated and heartbroken by the infernos raging through California. As the drought continues, and little is done to mitigate the environmental impact of careless and unconcerned energy and oil companies, I fear this is just the beginning. #ClimateChangeIsReal
1803 2018-11-14 20:57:36 What are the chances that Big Oil and the GOP "convinced" these scientists to "walk back" their independent findings?
1804 2018-11-14 20:57:30 I miss when oil changes were like $35.00
1805 2018-11-14 20:57:18 Just saw the most white collar, dad bod, got the afternoon off from work dude strolling down the heights puffin on an oil pen. #WorldDiabetesDay
1806 2018-11-14 20:57:18 I need to go change my oil :/
1807 2018-11-14 20:57:12 Bloody hell! There’s palm oil in @GalaxyChocolate Minstrels. Can someone tell me an alternative without #PalmOil
1808 2018-11-14 20:57:11 I fear this is the end for Cadbury in my life. As a child of Birmingham, with the Bourneville factory not far away, I grew to love the company and the chocolate. But, as if using palm oil wasn't bad enough, the new owners of Cadbury don't like paying tax either.
1809 2018-11-14 20:57:08 It's him, Dr. Water and his snake oil
1810 2018-11-14 20:57:06 The $300M is $16.67M/yr. The majority probably went to the Great Bear Rainforest to protect it (a 20-yr battle to which Harper also gave approx $30M), so what was left to block Alberta oil? LOL. Her conclusions are conspiratorial, not logical, and a deflection from oil subsidies.
1811 2018-11-14 20:57:05 I’ve just wasted the last 20 mins of my life watching this utter trash.  The BBC should be ashamed of what is being televised!  The price of peppers and a £4K Porsche which would have cost £65k new and now has an oil leak!!#watchdoglive
1812 2018-11-14 20:56:57 Union is good, but not with Big Oil, AOC is fighting Big Oil not Pelosi, you framing it other way is simple inaccurate.
1813 2018-11-14 20:56:56 Oil and water
1814 2018-11-14 20:56:48 My hair might fall out one of these days  I literally just conditioned it, semi detangled it, put oil it & threw it in a ponytail 
1815 2018-11-14 20:56:44 I'm sure little jo spends an equal amount of time protesting against USA, Saudi oil and contributes to any American fringe group wanting to meddle in other countries sovereignty.
1816 2018-11-14 20:56:43 #askrichard Hi Richard. Thanks for sharing thoughts on taking notes in Finding my Virginity. I often try to catch those thoughts, especially driving in traffic. Is Ghana on your radar? The country has no national airline yet lots of oil and gas.
1817 2018-11-14 20:56:42 Sear salmon skin side down until skin is crisp. Place in foil with oil and lemon (I had mushrooms too) and bake for 10 mins at 170°c. Boil rice and broccoli in a pot full of water, they should both be cooked at a similar time, 12~mins. Plate and throw on some sweet chilli sauce
1818 2018-11-14 20:56:28 Tu négocies tes accords pétroliers tout seul et non au nom de 27 pays, l'OPEP va t'adorer, et là les gilets jaunes vont devenir cramoisis car le baril serait multiplié par 2 ou 3 . Cà te fait un litre de gas oil autour des 3.5€
1819 2018-11-14 20:56:26 I think it's a conspiracy to clear land for the new cannabis industry to start farming. No blood for "hash" oil!
1820 2018-11-14 20:56:15 Oil barons, polluting, destroying and working hard to hold up any non fossil fuel research.
1821 2018-11-14 20:56:13 No. This issue has been known for decades but it needs large scale change in manufacturing, legislation etc to make a real difference. Palm oil is cheap & versatile, until an alternative is found it'll be used. Like transition from fossil to elec cars
1822 2018-11-14 20:56:02 Because of crude oil British government after killing of about 3 million #Biafrans the owners of the oil in a genocidal war , still refused to dissolve the forced UNION on called Nigeria. What a world!!!
1823 2018-11-14 20:56:00 Clean energy is the wave of the future. Try as they may, oil barons like the Koch Brothers cannot stop it. But, they will do everything in their power TO stop it until the day they die.
1824 2018-11-14 20:55:56 Sounds like it was a blockage. The oil will help a lot. Kitten food is good I used it with Lola. He's getting enough fluid. Sounds like he's been really off colour. I'm sorry I haven't seen about TC before.  Twitter isn't good ATM  Hugs to him from me  he's getting better x
1825 2018-11-14 20:55:54 No you don’t necessarily have to let it warm up your car will automatically idle higher creating more oil pressure to get oil to all moving parts faster when cold but you are NOT supposed to drive it hard while cold (over 3k RPM)
1826 2018-11-14 20:55:53 Great piece @DavidAFrench because it brings focus to this issue. Trump seems like a symptom of party advocacy snake oil vulture media preying on emotions and inspiring division. He has done best job of harnessing worst of this. We should reject hate & demand character! How is ?
1827 2018-11-14 20:55:49 Oil change = $92... well fuck me right 
1828 2018-11-14 20:55:46 This man said he finna buy some beard oil
1829 2018-11-14 20:55:44 It looks like the GOP is getting their wall. It’s being built by the troops that trump insisted be stationed at the border. He’s using the military’s budget of supplies and manpower to bypass regular channels. He’s none other than a slithery snake oil salesman!
1830 2018-11-14 20:55:36 AHSJSJ I JUST DONT EAT DAIRY AND SADLY these all contain palm oil (as far as I know) which I really don’t like to support but when I did eat them they were pretty good :)
1831 2018-11-14 20:55:32 Taranaki oil industry workers,  Northland swamp kauri harvesters, South Island game safari operators. 
Plenty of Kiwis currently being kicked in the guts but we focus on helping other countries so our celebrity PM gets overseas recognition
1832 2018-11-14 20:55:31 I hope now the whole country realises what a snake oil salesman you really are, with your Nazi style propaganda posters and bullshit about holding all the cards. Now you're looking for someone else to blame for the mess you've gotten the country into. Own your shit tosser!
1833 2018-11-14 20:55:30 would be less obvious and that individual would likely feel much less self conscious about such things. It serves no benefit to highlight these things for anyone if it bothers them and even if it doesn’t. I’m sure none of us are oil paintings. It’s not okay to judge people based
1834 2018-11-14 20:55:12 je les lave 1fois par semaine shampoing+masque , 1fois toutes les 3semaines bains d’huile(car j’ai la flemme sinon ce serait 1fois par semaine) , et je coiffe avec de l’huile mythic oil de l’oréal ou les huiles kerastase , si j’ai envie d’avoir de jolie boucle je met de la mousse
1835 2018-11-14 20:55:08 Just thought I lighten up your day by informing you that gas prices  dropped 20%. USA has enough oil to supply 80% of the world for the next 5 years.
1836 2018-11-14 20:54:56 Again Tom, if anything we did in Canada could possibly stop warming, I'd move into a little grass hut right beside yours. But it won't. So throwing away billions that could be solving real problems is lunacy, as is doing so AND continuing to support less responsible oil regimes.
1837 2018-11-14 20:54:42 Nigeria isn’t a normal country. We monitor only one key indicator obsessively, the price of crude oil.
1838 2018-11-14 20:54:37 #PalmOil is *really* hard to avoid. I've been trying to be palm oil free for nearly 2 years because of the persecution of Orang Utans. It sneaks into things like bread, it's in cola - Coke were into "sustainsble" PO whilst @PepsiCo have only recently ditched  #ConflictPalmOil 1/2
1839 2018-11-14 20:54:30 Today on How Its Made: Ranges, Climbing Walls, Canola Oil
1840 2018-11-14 20:54:29 Hi Chi. Do you have any book, or in general resource, recommendations for someone starting out trading oil? Fairly new at trading derivatives. Thanks
1841 2018-11-14 20:54:24 tendría que estar en la facultad en 5 minutos y estoy en la cama en tetas con la toalla en la cabeza escuchando oil of every pearl’s un-insides de sophie
1842 2018-11-14 20:54:24 What is the best website to research CBD Oil?  Any suggestions?
1843 2018-11-14 20:54:14 Alabama has cracked down on even CBD oil lately
1844 2018-11-14 20:54:14 I don’t want to discourage you but airfrying isn’t healthy. I have learnt conventional deep fry with non refined oil is much healthier.
1845 2018-11-14 20:54:13 Sis Linda mune extra 2 litre ye cooking oil here kumba
1846 2018-11-14 20:54:03 Nope. Unhealthy air pollution from dirty Canadian oil sands is making people sick and causing fatalities in cities around the world. Need to move off fossil fuels as quickly as possible.
1847 2018-11-14 20:54:02 يا يحيى  .. 
الله يعوض أمك وأبيك خير ويجبر في خواطرهم .. لا أشك لحظة في حرصهم على تربيتك تربية سليمة ...لكن ... لم يرد الله لك صلاحا في الدين ولا في الأخلاق .
1848 2018-11-14 20:54:01 If ur man dont know how to change brakes, oil, tire or spark plugs (all easy things) he not a real man... Ijs 
1849 2018-11-14 20:53:52 Thank you! They did this when Avery was 4 months and sent him to South America for 60 days so I’m used to it. But it’s gonna be hard with 2 especially during the holidays. Hate the oil field.
1850 2018-11-14 20:53:51 Flowing oil behind the cameras..
1851 2018-11-14 20:53:37 I do need to go and get my oil changed tho...smh
1852 2018-11-14 20:53:36 what I mean is that the Canadian economy, and with that Alberta, are taking such a deep discount on oil (we get WCS ~$17.90 when WTI is $56.26) that we miss out on around $80M a day. You're right about the sprawl, but David Miller... meh
1853 2018-11-14 20:53:35 Probably paid them off, its the oil way
1854 2018-11-14 20:53:33 So much for the attempted rally...Dow -177 before the close....but oil snapped its 12 session skid, although only having a modest impact on energy stox.
1855 2018-11-14 20:53:33 Go for the oil,  brilliant
1856 2018-11-14 20:53:26 I’ve never been sexually attracted to Alex Wright until I saw this pic. The magic of baby oil, I guess.
1857 2018-11-14 20:53:22 Pullback Day #6: $ES_F took the baton off #WTI #Crude #oil
1858 2018-11-14 20:53:22 World without oil is like no bouncing back to disaster
1859 2018-11-14 20:53:21 Oh,foreign oil doesn't care about natty gas.
1860 2018-11-14 20:53:10 If you've got new beard growing in, exfoliating with a brush helps.  I have found that a little jojoba oil doesn't make my facial acne worse, but ymmv.

I get frustrated when I get a huge acne cyst that basically takes out an entire section of my beard with it. Not fair.
1861 2018-11-14 20:52:54 Yeah but she never watches he kids, she nvr watches her kids when she's over, one time her 3 yr old put red oil based paint in her hair and they had to shave it off
1862 2018-11-14 20:52:53 Brussel sprouts in a baking dish, olive oil, maple syrup, sliced bacon, salt and pepper, half an hour at 180°C, stirring once - boom. #AutumnDelights
1863 2018-11-14 20:52:40 yes NAT gas and oil  ticker has alot of room higher $CEI
1864 2018-11-14 20:52:39 My belief is that foreign oil is trying to kill America oil by driving the price below production cost thur over supply.
1865 2018-11-14 20:52:36 Thinking I'm going to go back into selling CBD oil. Is there anyone interested in joining my team? #health #wellness #CBD #Cannabis #healthandwellness #painrelief #antistress #organic
1866 2018-11-14 20:52:31 met with @GreenwichBio rep today
CBD oil is now FDA approved,
can now start prescribing as an option for my Epilepsy patients

however
lots of misconceptions from proponents & opponents about its utility 

get informed before shelling out $30k/year 
or worse using impure CBD
1867 2018-11-14 20:52:28 That’s an oil filter  thank you , next
1868 2018-11-14 20:52:18 I’m all for the next generation of power. I’m sure engineers will figure out how to harness an energy source that is clean, renewable and cheap. Until then, it’s not economical to shut down oil & coal. As to “fixing” the climate, who gets to say what its supposed to be?
1869 2018-11-14 20:52:11 @divinechocolate is your best bet. No palm oil and fair trade.
1870 2018-11-14 20:52:10 You've got a point here.
I had a look in my local store at the weekend and sure enough the bourbons and custard creams (not own brand, but the only ones in the shop mind) contain palm oil.
Tbh I'm struggling to find palm oil free versions of either of these  2 classics any where.
1871 2018-11-14 20:52:10 @THEJamesWhale spot on James linguine al olio peperoncino with some smoked pancetta cubes & chargrilled sweet peppers- best patsa ever (use chilli oil for some added fire)
1872 2018-11-14 20:52:08 Wow yeah it’s not like a vast portion of our infrastructure is powered by oil, coal, or gas sold by powerful groups with a vested interest in discouraging alternative sources of energy production. You’re both vapid JFC
1873 2018-11-14 20:52:08 No, where in a repricing period, oil, bitcoin, etc. I own @netcoins so I welcome the volatility
1874 2018-11-14 20:51:58 Fam... oil+hot water+beef tube,  pour that in your pap that’s a potent meal my bra.
1875 2018-11-14 20:51:53 Coconut oil. Massage them into the nail beds and let sit for around 10-20 mins
1876 2018-11-14 20:51:47 lol like think about it, Nigeria produced just a tiny bit less than Dubai in oil, people in Dubai are driving Lamborghinis, what are y'all driving , y'all have to make that country modern and get rid of the nonsense fighting so you can understand what wealth is
1877 2018-11-14 20:51:37 Photios was a parasite in the Greiner Government. Libs need a good dose of castor oil ! Old but very effective remedy !
1878 2018-11-14 20:51:36 Does anyone else wait for their oil to get to 10% to get an oil-change?

1879 2018-11-14 20:51:32 Oil
1880 2018-11-14 20:51:21 In your world, ignorance is the solution to everything.  29 years ago, AGW science was not a problem until the oil lobby worked out the $$$ trillions in revenue it would cost them.
1881 2018-11-14 20:51:20 Dreads clean. Wait til it dry some more then oil it.
1882 2018-11-14 20:51:20 I do not understand . Why do the Pakistani beggars think of solving the problems of Kashmir without not having their own machine oil?
1883 2018-11-14 20:51:09 We loosened ours up for a while but went back after the sub crash.  Our 3 biggest cities will be more expensive than London, yes really and not sure about now but Calgary is biggest city near oil sands and it was 3 times what is considered astronomical.
1884 2018-11-14 20:51:09 Watching a programme on cutting down on plastic right after reading an article on palm oil.  Where do you start to make a difference 
1885 2018-11-14 20:51:07 Ownership pattern of media houses in india has to change they have to free from other business like in usa. Media owners are not allowed to dl business in other discipline. In India person can own telecom, sugarecane, oil and gas , and also the media empire. Make media free
1886 2018-11-14 20:51:00 Tom Steyer became a billionaire investing in the oil & gas industry.
Now that CAPITALISM has got him rich, he wants to destroy the oil & gas industry.
Alternative energy & fuels need to live or die on their own merit.
Don't force feed this crap onto all of us YOU HYPOCRITICAL POS
1887 2018-11-14 20:50:59 Very pleased with services and products I have received.  Not enough CBD oil in stock in some stores.  Happy this is finally here.  Much better for pain than medication.
1888 2018-11-14 20:50:50 BofA: "#Oil bulls, us included, have capitulated and we no longer see oil climbing to $95/bbl next year. Still, we believe oil is oversold and will likely bounce up from the current levels, as #OPEC+ dials back production in December".
1889 2018-11-14 20:50:48 Finally got an oil change and I swear my car grew arms and hugged me
1890 2018-11-14 20:50:46 I need an oil change bad! Maybe Sunday
1891 2018-11-14 20:50:37 Just want a man who’s going to check my car for an oil change and takes it to get it done.
1892 2018-11-14 20:50:25 I've just read the small print on the #BrexitDeal and to make matters worse it turns out it contains palm oil.
1893 2018-11-14 20:50:25 And they’re still saying this BS. My friend who’s going to a University told me that it turns out, they were correct and coconut oil is bad 
1894 2018-11-14 20:50:19 Another racist Barbie joins the party, a 1% one by the looks of it. Candice, Langley is a strong supporter of oil/gas, perhaps someone can build a refinery there?
1895 2018-11-14 20:50:19 Sorry just a quick follow up point! 

As we see in developing countries with palm oil plantations, there’s always the potential for a repeat..., for the voices to be lost as it were in the name of development and growth.
1896 2018-11-14 20:50:16 Alaskans own 38,000 shares of TOA OIL CO LTD, worth $46,720. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in JAPAN.
1897 2018-11-14 20:50:07 the fact that oil is holding onto a green day makes we wonder if a turn in gas is on deck.
1898 2018-11-14 20:49:59 @kunleafolayan is like an after effect of an ejaculation. He’s weak. He has apologize to them. U don’t apologize for saying d truth against wrong. He came 2 Abuja, kissed oil with Asorock. They saw he was becoming dangerous wit d script & screens then they corrupted him. #coward
1899 2018-11-14 20:49:54 apppro NAILED IT! This was a Trump led situation Comedy where everyone is concerned there wouldn't be enough salt in the soup and by the end of the show you've got SALT SOUP! The Oil Shortage that NEVER MATERIALIZED!
1900 2018-11-14 20:49:46 Idk what female needs to hear this but, go get your oil and filter changed in your car! 
1901 2018-11-14 20:49:41 Was Buhari responsible for the oil fall?

I'm no fan of any politician but the mess ure seeing around today wasn't from him. Like u said "diversification is a process", if the past governments had diversify from the boom, at least we will not be where we are today.
1902 2018-11-14 20:49:40 Shoulda stayed out of the oil pits these past 2 months....
1903 2018-11-14 20:49:35 I woke up with pressure in my left eye and pain near my tear duct. Went to the ophthalmologist and they told me I have a blocked oil gland and that I basically need to stop crying so much  it’s fine I’m fine
1904 2018-11-14 20:49:20 They are using that as one of their bargaining chips. Also Iran oil sanctions
1905 2018-11-14 20:49:13 Christian Marital Advice: Lay hands on yo wife with that oil and watch God move lol
1906 2018-11-14 20:49:09 Was coughing a lot. Sure he had a fur blockage. Eyes were deep set. I’ve melted coconut oil into warm fish for him. He wouldn’t even eat fish soups a couple of weeks ago. Gets butter as well. Will get kitten food as it’s high in calories, will mix in his food
1907 2018-11-14 20:49:06 oh!イル
1908 2018-11-14 20:49:06 I’ll change my ladies oil, put gas in the car, wash it, make sure the tires are full of air and aligned, but when I want a sandwich made I don’t wanna hear nothing
1909 2018-11-14 20:48:59 Best bet for toiletries is @LushLtd - no palm oil in their products
1910 2018-11-14 20:48:52 Any of y’all people got some motor oil
1911 2018-11-14 20:48:47 snake oil salesmen like #BillKristol (just to mention ONE OF MANY) are more phony that the TELEVANGELIST Jim & Tammy Baker ... they get rich off the angst of REAL #Conservatives who are too busy taking care of their families to do anything except send some PHONY Activist a check
1912 2018-11-14 20:48:46 Bezos is getting $BILLIONS not just millions....  Amazon is a monopoly that needs to be broken like Standard oil in the early part of the 20th century.  No one should have as much money as Bezos does.
1913 2018-11-14 20:48:41 proud of my 5750 call for oil today
1914 2018-11-14 20:48:38 affirmative action is snake oil
1915 2018-11-14 20:48:37 .. he has dried food with different things added either sardines in sunflower oil or chicken & also eggs ..oh and the odd thing he can persuade you to give him off your plate 
1916 2018-11-14 20:48:24 A schedule D notice has been put on the size of the *Clair ridge oil field." Thanks to Teresa May and her Brexit shambles I suspect the UK's oil will run out within five years, hopefully Scotland (at last) will enjoy the proceeds for many decades to come. it's not running out
1917 2018-11-14 20:48:20 oh good I'd love to pay $800 for a glorified PC that won't let me do anything but convert electricity into snake oil
1918 2018-11-14 20:48:19 Continued dependence of global financial markets on crude oil prices should be a clear sign that ruling class interests align with the destruction of the planet
1919 2018-11-14 20:48:17 ah, gotchya.  why i mentioned Kashogghi, interesting coincidence that happened day before Powell "neutral rate" statement. that was definitely when oil topped, maybe not exactly when spx topped.  powell needs to fix this mess tonite, or he won't even get one hike done in 2019
1920 2018-11-14 20:48:12 So, have we got this right.  Special deals for Gib, Cyprus  and NI,  but nothing for oil rich Scotland?  I wonder why?
1921 2018-11-14 20:48:07 C'mon, tell @rogerkver, @jihanwu, @calvinayre that you don't want to own BCH SV, a digital token run by a delusional mental patient? He is going to control the world's supply of money the way John D. Rockefeller controlled the world's supply of oil. I heard him say it himself!
1922 2018-11-14 20:48:03 Bill back jim s back  tge silver truck...ef spider bite...for ed it is all about money he doesnt cate if a baby died or if bill bbq it or if the oil clogged the pipes  he just carez that he has money.
1923 2018-11-14 20:48:00 CPI inflation likely to slow/moderate over coming months as oil prices (among others) have reversed. We'll see if Fed acknowledges that and market vol, biz investment in coming weeks.
1924 2018-11-14 20:47:57 Some days I get really mad at how oily my skin still is and how many times I have to use oil blotting sheets, but then I think about how good I’m gonna look when I’m old and everyone is all wrinkly and it makes me a feel a lot better  
1925 2018-11-14 20:47:23 Yes. I’ll advise you don’t go over the top. I mean you don’t want to seem so presumptuous. So a few tubers of yam and well wrapped palm oil with yaba purchased curry and thyme is a good package.
1926 2018-11-14 20:47:17 In my World its called creed, they do the same thing Oil Companys do the supplier's create a shortage to drive the prices up, this isn't the 1940s they know how much this Country use's everyday every year and when the price's go up there will plenty available just like Gas.
1927 2018-11-14 20:47:10 I get oil, bring salt
1928 2018-11-14 20:47:04 LOL you defending Big Oil with teeth and nails, and I am the sycophant, please someone that doesn't know how to argue will recur to insults.
1929 2018-11-14 20:46:58 How’s that? Isn’t it Notley that’s been blocking everything oil?
1930 2018-11-14 20:46:26 Olbas oil
1931 2018-11-14 20:46:16 Thats great! But quick question: what are you replacing palm oil with in your products? Or are you removing it without substituting it for something else?
1932 2018-11-14 20:46:15 The best deal they had, was being a full paid up member of the EU & they have thrown that away based on the lies & cheap promises of snake oil salesmen. Whatever happens now, the UK has taken a step back.
1933 2018-11-14 20:46:10 You can get CBD oil by mail in all 50 states. It has no THC so it is legal. It helped with pain in a friend of mine with brain cancer before she died. I think if she had known more about it she might have lived.
1934 2018-11-14 20:45:57 how about another place I can get brand name engine oil for $1.99 a qt? DAMMIT ima miss the Liquidators....
1935 2018-11-14 20:45:55 @SatchinPanda I would like to find a way to take CBD in the morning without impacting my Time restricted feeding. I assume most of the oil‘s that I would take orally would affect it but I am curious about smoking CBD oil?
1936 2018-11-14 20:45:54 I think I also qualify...., ambassador, hey, what do you say, Bomb.

But, these "qualify" with a healthy injection of heavy oil and grease into a few hands. But Nigerians!!!!! LOLEST
1937 2018-11-14 20:45:46 ALSO. how are you going to get upset with me for a straw while we all sit by and watch oil companies destroy the oceans??
1938 2018-11-14 20:45:43 @Morrisons afternoon all, please can you send me any information you have about where you source the palm oil in your products? I realise how blind I've been & I'm not prepared to buy products containing #dirtypalmoil any more. #rangtan
1939 2018-11-14 20:45:36 Absolutely but oil & gas industry is spending MILLIONS $$ lobbying DC to keep from turning to clean sources. China is raking up profits while US is stuck in 1950’s. Congrats R’s & Koch Bros! Renewable jobs are triple oil & gas...
1940 2018-11-14 20:45:31 With plastic whales made from oil. Idiots.
1941 2018-11-14 20:45:15 Or maybe don't buy shit from a snake oil salesman.Hes a fraud and people should have enough common sense to realize that.
1942 2018-11-14 20:45:12 I would have a squirty bottle with oily liquid in it to squirty it in her mouth to oil her throat... for one.
1943 2018-11-14 20:45:10 You brain oil needs change, ode
1944 2018-11-14 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1945 2018-11-14 20:45:01 1 day left to protect the #rainforest, #orangutans, and #palmoil workers from greedy companies like @Indofood! RT to tell @RSPOtweets, the global palm oil body, to vote to stop certifying destructive palm oil in its new Principles and Criteria #RSPO #RT16
1946 2018-11-14 20:45:01 I’m getting an oil change and this guy really just lit one up next to me
1947 2018-11-14 20:44:52 #OIL report in an hour... many expecting more bearish news on that front. Let's see what it brings
1948 2018-11-14 20:44:39 My car tells me when I need an oil change that’s fye
1949 2018-11-14 20:44:37 so what the HECK am I supposed to do with this useless ass tub of coconut oil from shea moisture 
1950 2018-11-14 20:44:32 Oil production in CA is sufficiently badly polluting, especially with regard to ground water, that it's not at all popular in urban areas. Obviously that changes as soon as gas prices go up a lot, but then it becomes a matter of how the restrictions are implemented.
1951 2018-11-14 20:44:24 finished basing my hair 2 hours ago and I overdid it, the oil is still dripping from my forehead  I look so shiny.
1952 2018-11-14 20:44:13 This chicken and this website need Oil of Olay. And Jesus. And Leah Chase.
1953 2018-11-14 20:43:45 Indeed they were, but they also removed resources available in production, used up both air power and man power, and used up already scarce oil in flying them to attack
1954 2018-11-14 20:43:38 I make mine by blanching. Cutting them in half, layering them on heated olive oil, with chopped garlic and chopped bacon bits. Carmelize, top with parmesan cheese (and panko bread crumbs, but they're optional).
1955 2018-11-14 20:43:36 Are you using Palm Oil in those?!?!
1956 2018-11-14 20:43:05 My current fave is Dill, Sea Salt & Olive Oil. Will you send me a box in exchange for the 30 mouthwatering minutes I spent proofreading your boxes?
1957 2018-11-14 20:42:57 Just announce some new oil reservoirs beneath Scotland and we'll have a couple supercarriers park off your coast by the end of the week.
1958 2018-11-14 20:42:56 That oil product is a threat too, to BC's coastal economy
1959 2018-11-14 20:42:42 I think he’s part of Liberty’s “Snake Oil Speaker” series.
1960 2018-11-14 20:42:42 Is Obama going to take credit for the lower oil prices too? #oilprices
1961 2018-11-14 20:42:36 From what I can gather the production of some palm oil is less detrimental to the environment than other oils. It is "dirty palm oil" that we/you should be focusing upon and campaigning again.
1962 2018-11-14 20:42:35 What's your recipe? I use olive oil and coconut oil with a touch of almond oil.
1963 2018-11-14 20:42:17 Socialism is too vague a term to discuss accurately anyway.  Forcibly nationalizing the oil industry and single payer health care are completely different things.    The US already has single payer health care for seniors, it's called Medicare.
1964 2018-11-14 20:42:01 Why did the oil monarch do after a socialist revolution hit Switzerland?
1965 2018-11-14 20:41:55 @OIL_MEN
1966 2018-11-14 20:41:53 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
1967 2018-11-14 20:41:52 my take is if u take oil money and country backed clubs out (city psg) who no one can get near..were prob only behind barca with our spending and have 3rd highest budget in league...pogba sanchez lukaku wer 3 unbelievable signings who for whatever reason now look sunday league
1968 2018-11-14 20:41:44 Maybe because climate change is real and is a serious threat to the whole planet and you should stop pandering and selling out to oil companies and concentrate on helping save the planet while we still can?
1969 2018-11-14 20:41:39 Welcome to the semi EU member club  we basicly regulate most stuff by EU, but dont have to give away our oil money 
1970 2018-11-14 20:41:34 lol urban legion-everyone washed just didn't look like it and the patchouli oil! God, I hate that stuff still.
1971 2018-11-14 20:41:31 1. Hold the military and defense contractors accountable .  

2.  Hold politicians receiving funds from oil and gas companies accountable.

3.  Ride your bike or take a walk and eat more vegetables.
1972 2018-11-14 20:41:29 Brought My car to the Honda Dealership for an oil change for $92. Got a blueberry muffin and coffee, free car wash, and 2 Lyft rides to the gym and back to the dealership. Was that worth?
1973 2018-11-14 20:41:20 Take your car to get a simple oil change and they’re gonna act like if there’s 100 things wrong with it
1974 2018-11-14 20:41:17 Show me an NFL fan base that on the whole would embrace that gracefully? There is not one.  Same with locker room. You know that. Great dig on  a portion of the online portion of all Browns fans though. Squeaky wheel gets the oil though I guess
1975 2018-11-14 20:41:17 #ItsTime to #ProtectOurCoast
 Help us amplify this message  
Congress has the power to stop Trump's dangerous giveaway to the oil industry. Tell them to stand up to this reckless plan and protect all of us from expanded offshore drilling because #ItsTime to #ProtectOurCoast!
1976 2018-11-14 20:41:07 #writingchat Lavender oil. Rub it on like your Mum used to rub on the Vick when you had a cold. Knocks you out. Or wine. Don't rub that on. Drink it!
1977 2018-11-14 20:41:04 استح يا وضيع .
قبحك الله ... 
عهدنا أهل جيزان طيبين .. أنت يا #يحي_الامير و #صلاح_الطبيقي من طينة واحدة اجرام وتشبيح لا حدود له ، أدعوا أهل #جازان الكرام أن يتبرأوا منكما .
1978 2018-11-14 20:40:50 "Medical article" from the website of a known antivax doctor who sells snake oil? Not the best source, tbh.
1979 2018-11-14 20:40:32 trying to be really careful to only buy palm oil free products as I sponsor a monkey at Monkey World and they are educating sponsor parents well! #PalmOilFree #Icelandad #RangTan
1980 2018-11-14 20:40:32 You know your mechanics your mate when you take the car for a service and he Says ‘you know your oil lights on aye egg?’ 

In other news washings done, school drop offs done and car services by 9.30  Bula Vinaka
1981 2018-11-14 20:40:26 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
1982 2018-11-14 20:40:20 Well, that's wrong. But they should be pointing you towards McCarthy's office instead of Pelosi's for your Green New Deal protests. He is, after all, of the coal and oil party.
1983 2018-11-14 20:40:18 Global oil prices rose for the first time in 13 trading sessions on growing expectations that OPEC and its allies may cut output. Brent crude rose by US65 cents or 1.0% to US$66.12 a barrel and the US Nymex price rose by US56 cents or 1.0% to US$56.25 a barrel. #ausbiz #ausecon
1984 2018-11-14 20:40:10 Ownership of the oil in Scotland's water is a problem. They need indepence
1985 2018-11-14 20:40:08 And so has the tide (without a future of more oil drilling and water pollution from spills) #CA45.
1986 2018-11-14 20:40:08 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
1987 2018-11-14 20:40:03 Family Nutrition: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this November? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
1988 2018-11-14 20:39:52 almond oil is amazing for skin 
1989 2018-11-14 20:39:50 Seasoned iron. I give mine a light wipe with rapeseed oil before popping the dough in for final prove. Bake around 50 minutes gas Mark 6 of hot solid fuel for a crusty 2lb loaf. Cool in the tin for 20 minutes and the loaf just lifts out 
1990 2018-11-14 20:39:44 Farmers that have been impacted by trump should look at the possibility of during soybeans into a gasoline additive. If we can used French fry oil    Why not soybeans oil!!
1991 2018-11-14 20:39:43 The oil in your food is going to change phase at the slightest drop in temperature.....be a good sport and gobble up before that happens
1992 2018-11-14 20:39:42 #ledaig nose: crude oil, petroleum, dark earthy peat. Meaty notes and later on vanilla and sweet citrus come up. I quite like this one #ClaxtonsWhisky
1993 2018-11-14 20:39:40 No one should have to choose between heating and eating. By switching from propane, electric or oil heating to natural gas, residents can save up to $2500 per year. By providing greater access to natural gas, we're putting more money back in your pocket! @fordnation #OnPoli
1994 2018-11-14 20:39:37 A lot! New Zealand is in the middle of an electricity price review, is doing improvements to the Emissions Trading Scheme, has set up an independent Climate Change Commission, has passed a polarising law ending future offshore oil & gas exploration around the country...and so on.
1995 2018-11-14 20:39:31 ほんとに！！会いたい！
1996 2018-11-14 20:39:29 This cold and rainy weather is making my hair angry . Been drenching it with coconut oil  gotta stay moisturized
1997 2018-11-14 20:39:27 Houston beyond oil gas be struggling a bit, tbh
1998 2018-11-14 20:39:22 Adore mine, have the 1 and 2lb tins. Not non-stick to start with (so oil & flour well and expect a few casualties) but a couple of years on completely faultless. Never use detergent or put in dishwasher.
1999 2018-11-14 20:39:20 California Socialism an environment go to have to bring in company an business more an oil company what every they do not like it California Socialism an environment you have not enough the way you are going . you have to bring company Business an oil company

2001 2018-11-14 20:39:17 Nutella being mostly Palm Oil is what grosses me out. That stuff is evil... Horribly bad for you, and quite possibly one of the most environmentally damaging crops in existence.
2002 2018-11-14 20:39:09 Financial services, real estate & tourism attached to oil? I dont think so. Dubai's dependency on oil is limited; yet ever-so apparent..
2003 2018-11-14 20:39:07 Emma Dunkley @EmDunks as “Oil” is not a commodity; its price has always been & will be fixed by the oil cartels
2004 2018-11-14 20:38:49 both sound hot and fun and tasty. are we tasting olive oil?
2005 2018-11-14 20:38:47 I was babtized in used motor oil
2006 2018-11-14 20:38:39 Need To Hurry Up And Get My Oil Changed 
2007 2018-11-14 20:38:38 @realDonaldTrump  Good job on #oil #CL_F #WTI . But what about Natural Gas which is abundant apparently and it is being manipulated to rip off common man this winter.  Study and act now
2008 2018-11-14 20:38:31 "THEN LAMP OIL, ROPE, AND BOMBS FOR YOU!"
2009 2018-11-14 20:38:25 I can't imagine how terrible it was after 20 years. My husband was on codiene for years, he had a bad time stopping that too, he used black seed oil capsules and they really helped him with the pain and cramps etc
2010 2018-11-14 20:38:08 You could reply to him with LOL or with OIL both are equally pithy responses..
2011 2018-11-14 20:37:54 I am thinking members of OPEC & other related countries weren't pleased & even insulted by Trump's statement that OPEC is a monopoly, & that he "does not like it". OPEC may show the USA who's really in charge. Started already? "I can drive oil prices to zero" Preemptive by Trump?
2012 2018-11-14 20:37:52 And he belongs to the cult of Pentecostalism don't forget! I see a revivalist snake oil salesman trying to covertly push his religious beliefs!
2013 2018-11-14 20:37:52 I inadvertently took a job on today 2  pay 4 food, electricity & oil.
Managed it,but now I've reopened my spine&upper rib cage.
My son is sorted but can't go 2 GP as he's been asked 2 'inform' on my phys cond& I'll loose my £42 p/w full stop.
Even morph not working but son safe.
2014 2018-11-14 20:37:48 Half olive oil and half fairly liquid, squish the sponge into it loads, rinse under warm water and then if there's still surface stains I'll use a bit of the solid sponge cleanser from Penney's.
2015 2018-11-14 20:37:48 Mine is too I gotta put some oil on it cuz lotion not helping.
2016 2018-11-14 20:37:45 纽约最近看见好几家可以加CBD oil的咖啡店了
2017 2018-11-14 20:37:44 @cwilkins42 checking his team mate's oil at practice then again in the showers.
2018 2018-11-14 20:37:39 I just spilled like 10 bottles of olive oil all over the floor  Ima catch mf's slippin today
2019 2018-11-14 20:37:29 She probably has shared in Palm oil
2020 2018-11-14 20:37:29 Pretty sure the first time I heard about palm oil and that it threatens orangutans in its cultivation I thought that it was an oil taken from the palms of their hands and they were hunted for it. I am extremely dumb and that’s fine
2021 2018-11-14 20:37:25 Oil prices looked set to finally break their record breaking 12-day losing streak on Wednesday morning, but analysts remain concerned that prices could drop below $50 a barrel.

2023 2018-11-14 20:37:14 Is that time of the year my ebony people. When everytime you leave the house you have to oil your face up like you’re going to spar with Floyd Mayweather. siiiigh
2024 2018-11-14 20:37:11 I got oil on my camera and I’m mad cause my pictures coming out blurry no matter how much I wipe if off 
2025 2018-11-14 20:36:57 Why is @Chevron the last Big #Oil company still funding anti-climate #ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic] #ClimateChange #ClimateActionNow
2026 2018-11-14 20:36:56 Cutting out meat from your diet is way better for the environment than cutting out palm oil. I'm not taking part but everyone's being mislead.
2027 2018-11-14 20:36:55 I’ve been Applying black castor oil to my edges everyday for the past few weeks and my edges are flourishing 
2028 2018-11-14 20:36:54 Livorno. Trademarke. Corn oil
2029 2018-11-14 20:36:50 So let's summarize the #oil market today:
- #Trump has the b... of #MBS in his hand with #Khashoggi
- #Putin has the b.... of #Trump in his hand (ask #Mueller)
- In the end #Putin is the new big boss on #oil
2030 2018-11-14 20:36:49 By the way did you know that renowned brands like Ferrero, Nutella use palm oil in their processes. It's part of their main raw materials.
2031 2018-11-14 20:36:45 @UKVolkswagen if my car is showing an Inspection Service in 372 miles and a Oil Service in 745 miles, can I wait until the Oil Service is due to get both done at the same time?   
2032 2018-11-14 20:36:26 The way Maiduguri girls like guys with car you'll think they breastfed them with engine oil 
2033 2018-11-14 20:36:26 Getting oil changed this morning, the shop had on old #Roseanne episodes.  I never watched the show as a kid, and now I wish I had. Funny, poignant, CLEAN with touch of sincerity missing from today’s sitcoms. I can see why a spinoff would have worked if PC crowd didn’t kill it.
2034 2018-11-14 20:36:23 Imagine if you lavender oil got you high... I would be so stress free 
2035 2018-11-14 20:36:21 Rick Perry soon to be king of the big oil lobbyists.
2036 2018-11-14 20:36:20 I do not agree.  If you do not buy any processed food then it should be easy.  Just use fresh local products and use butter or lard to fry.  I would say use Olive oil but often palm oil is illegal mixed with it.
2037 2018-11-14 20:36:17 Grabbed some at .2 hopefully ppr doesn’t tank by then. Oil has not been fairing well lately . 
2038 2018-11-14 20:36:10 I need an oil change bruh
2039 2018-11-14 20:36:08 "A bit of oil lets a hand go a long way~."
2040 2018-11-14 20:36:04 tea tree oil >>>>>>>
2041 2018-11-14 20:36:01 Other than baking, what are the uses for coconut oil? #AskSharon #ThePlantPoweredDietitian 
2042 2018-11-14 20:35:57 Oh how convenient, don't  bother to mention....the petro currency is backed by oil, gas, gold and diamonds, and is meant to help overcome, wait for it....... the US and EU sanctions!!!
2043 2018-11-14 20:35:51 Thanks. I'll quote you on that. They are considered far more harmful to the environment than palm oil. So where are you guys heading with this?
2044 2018-11-14 20:35:51 Yes an unregulated central bank ran by the heads of the largest banks is where it’s at all you antiestablishment noobs. Nouriel is right btc is the mother of all toxic pollutants, way worse than nukes and dumping oil in the ocean.
2045 2018-11-14 20:35:50 @WBrettWilson is a climate denier nutjob. Even conservatives call him that. Investment is strong in the oil sector.
2046 2018-11-14 20:35:50 I'm sure little Pete protests loudly against his own massive USA oil production industry.  Right?
2047 2018-11-14 20:35:41 Aveda Beautifying Composition Oil. Hair, body, nails, it's what saves me during the winter and so nice I use it year-round.
2048 2018-11-14 20:35:27 So.....that’s....everything....then. You realise how pretty much everything is made of oil?
2049 2018-11-14 20:35:19 Hi from Giki Social Enterprise - we rate 250,000 supermarket products on sustainability - including sustainable palm oil - it’s not easy and we have set a high hurdle for sustainable palm, but download our app - hope it helps! 
2050 2018-11-14 20:35:08 Man crypto got hit harder than oil yesterday and stocks lately.  So it’s not a flight to quality asset yet.
2051 2018-11-14 20:35:03 My understanding was that, extremely stupidly, they thought attacking pearl harbour would intimidate the US into giving them the oil access back, and that in the event they didn't it would damage naval capability. But as we know, battle of midway proved otherwise 
2052 2018-11-14 20:35:00 Lmfao i don’t be knowing if it’s true last time i went for an oil check and they ran me $100 for some bullshit 
2053 2018-11-14 20:34:57 @CadburyUK  stop using dirty palm oil, there is no Planet B!!!!
2054 2018-11-14 20:34:53 And I'd question where that wealth in London came from. I think our oil money is what built the finance sector in London. Before oil London looked like shit I'm sorry to say.
2055 2018-11-14 20:34:42 Then why are we buying foreign oil?
2056 2018-11-14 20:34:36 Oil?
2057 2018-11-14 20:34:34 This has nothing to do with Canada. The money is there and laying stagnant. Check your sources a little more. While you’re at it, check into the rothschilds and see who’s actually funding the blockage of our oil to port.
2058 2018-11-14 20:34:33 motor oil
2059 2018-11-14 20:34:32 Usually when I go to the shop by myself for something simple they play me into thinking my car gon break down but today Rocky hooked me up on my tires, windshield and half off my oil change. S/o to you Rocky you go be great.
2060 2018-11-14 20:34:27 Oh yes, it does.  Restore the Nautical Border to Berwick and stop stealing Scottish Oil & Gas from OUR seas.

BTW selling to 27 Countries is far more profitable than selling to ONE - However, England relies on Scotland for 62% of their Financial Exports THAT WILL NOT CHANGE
2061 2018-11-14 20:34:26 Zero pipelines for exports of oil to Asia. Bought one. It doesn’t now, and won’t when and if it’s ever built.
2062 2018-11-14 20:34:22 Fish and chips cooked in extra virgin olive oil
2063 2018-11-14 20:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
2064 2018-11-14 20:34:15 so i have the kinds that use oil and it’s a rlly cheap preheating pen hehe
2065 2018-11-14 20:34:15 Coconut oil can be used for so many things, lip balm, moisturiser, bringing your battered hair back to life... how do I go about applying it to my soul?
2066 2018-11-14 20:34:13 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]

2068 2018-11-14 20:34:06 .... But they are doing partnerships with Angola and other counties. The (manipulated) Yuan goes one way - China gets oil / minerals.
2069 2018-11-14 20:34:05 Lmao pls do , fuck around go for your next oil change and end up with a laundry list of repairs 
2070 2018-11-14 20:34:05 LEAVE OUR COMMUNITY OR RISK ATTACKS ~~ EX- MILITANTS TO OIL COMPANIES.
2071 2018-11-14 20:34:02 Just made my own shampoo. I can’t wait to wash my hair. Then moisturize it with the oil spray I concocted. I really love making this stuff. The research, the trial and error, the feeling when you get it right... I love it all.
2072 2018-11-14 20:33:58 New jpipe on friday and i couldnt be anymore excited, gona be taking off my oil pan and re-sealing it since the jpipe is gona be off and outta the way
2073 2018-11-14 20:33:54 I agree that Hitler was a terrible tactician but its about the situation. For example, he declared war on the States after pearl harbour, it wasn't necessarily a choice. Breaking the pact was over communist neighbour, wanted all of Poland, Luftwaffe losing to RAF, and the oil
2074 2018-11-14 20:33:39 But the Oil Producing Countries are say the supply is higher than demand. (The same media you are telling us this) I guess wamemulika hiyo fuel consumption ya Christmas season.
2075 2018-11-14 20:33:24 Oil and gas accounting or business management
2076 2018-11-14 20:33:23 Just package the asteroid defense spending as an oil derrick operator stimulus package and I’m sure it’ll go through fine.
2077 2018-11-14 20:33:23 With bulk prices falling shouldn’t they be protesting to the oil companies for failing to pass on those reductions.
2078 2018-11-14 20:33:23 i’m glad my papa taught me how to check/change my tires and check my oil.
2079 2018-11-14 20:33:23 A drop of jojoba oil in my hand lotion at night has saved my hands from washing them constantly at work!
2080 2018-11-14 20:33:20 Oil & Gas commodities price per gal are down, considerably, $60 per barrel. The real problem are states like California where actual tax on gas is closer to 73.82 cents per gallon, depending on where you fill up and the price of gas at the time.
2081 2018-11-14 20:33:15 The large amount of flammable oil in Tutankamun's tomb caused his mummy to catch fire shortly after burial
2082 2018-11-14 20:33:07 He's never changed a light bulb, changed the oil in his car,  made his own bed,  folded his own clothes,  run his own errands, mowed his own lawn.  He's a pampered poodle.
2083 2018-11-14 20:33:06 Interesting to see how oil plays out over the rest of the year. You'd expect a bounce here but on the bright side my local oil company is quoting  £257 for 500L for next Friday from £308.
2084 2018-11-14 20:33:01 Natural Gas was up 20% in overnight trade (up 45% in last two weeks). Crude Oil up $1 a barrel after having been in a solid downtrend, down $22 (28%) since the start of last month.

2086 2018-11-14 20:32:50 I haven’t actually but he also has mast cell tumours and it’s supposed to be good for that. I wouldn’t know where to get proper oil from though 
2087 2018-11-14 20:32:50 #natgas market is a joke. America is the Saudi Arabia of natgas and can easily turn back on the spigots. Enjoy the run, soon it will tank like #oil. $UNG, $UGAZ, $DGAZ, $BOIL
2088 2018-11-14 20:32:43 They did testing for many years before since is not their first experience with temporary tattoos.. and if it was for a one time thing he could just remove it with some bby oil or something..
Only time could tell but im both confused AND EXCITEDㅠㅠㅠㅠ
2089 2018-11-14 20:32:24 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ABOUT THE OIL
2090 2018-11-14 20:32:06 remember two days ago when no one gave a shit about palm oil

2092 2018-11-14 20:32:02 We had them down the oil seed rape field in the summer
2093 2018-11-14 20:31:53 I put peppermint oil on my feet last night, drank peppermint tea, and put lavander behind my ears and on my wrist and I still was up every 45 minutes last night!
2094 2018-11-14 20:31:48 Reaching down to pat the puppy as he bounds up, I’m then greeted by your hug and demand for kisses.

2098 2018-11-14 20:31:23 Oh my god you retweeted a tweet by Andrea Jenkyns the women is thicker than crude oil. You would get better responses reading the bible to a gold fish than Jenkyns lol
2099 2018-11-14 20:31:15 Oil almost collapsed 10% yesterday
2100 2018-11-14 20:31:07 Someone give me a round of applause. I’m finally getting an oil change
2101 2018-11-14 20:30:56 If we get on a roll and sweep this weekend, I figure we could  go 6-2, Split 4-4, if we loose both games, we will be lucky to be 3-5. The weekend is gonna be interesting! Go Oil!
2102 2018-11-14 20:30:56 That’s great.  Oil production is important because it is a source for the plastics you find in everyday products.  I for one feel plastic is actually the number one environmental issue this world faces, not a warming planet or our resources.
2103 2018-11-14 20:30:55 What I want for an early Christmas gift? 4 quarts of Honda engine and transmission oil, air and oil filters, spark plugs, and back end struts I’d love you forever   

Adulting at its finest 
2104 2018-11-14 20:30:50 So I'm in a store..a caucasian woman walks up to me n says "your skin is beautiful!" I said "thank you."...she asked "how do you keep it so nice...?" I told her...I use coconut oil(#true)...and she said "OMG! From where??" ..and with a straight face.....I told her....
(Pt.1)
2105 2018-11-14 20:30:49 Can you think of any other circumstances where this occurs......Oil companies, defense contractors, pharmaceutical companies, etc
2106 2018-11-14 20:30:46 Just can't quite make my palm oil / olive oil / popeye wanking joke work.
2107 2018-11-14 20:30:36 Can’t believe any Brexit pop lasts too long. Like that’s a big help for NVDA, Oil, etc.
2108 2018-11-14 20:30:36 Idk this makes me feel lots of empathy for the oil giant who knowingly poisoned the planet
2109 2018-11-14 20:30:28 Hmmmmmm I am not totally convinced that you have not just used the #Greenpeace film for below the line exposure, given you have not committed to not stocking palm oil products. The comment from your CEO was that you are a commercial organisation first

2120 2018-11-14 20:29:36 Why with oil prices dropping from $100 to sub-$50 in the last 2 months has the American public not seen any relief at the pumps? Isn’t that something you can actually participate in? Why are you allowing oil companies to keep gasoline prices the same, when their costs are half?
2121 2018-11-14 20:29:05 The first cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical hit the market a few months ago. Watch for the push by Big Pharma to shut down cannabinoid oil distributors like #CharlottesWeb and #GreenRoads to prevent them from cutting into their profits in the name of "public safety". #CBD
2122 2018-11-14 20:29:02 Good.  You won’t be drilling or spilling oil here.
2123 2018-11-14 20:28:56 @Honda I purchased a 2018 Honda Accord 3months ago. The dealership told me first oil change is on them, but the thing is. I live over 60 miles away from where I purchased the car. I asked if it could be transferred to a local Honda dealership. They said, no. Can you help?
2124 2018-11-14 20:28:49 Thank you for your response but sustainable doesn’t explain the process gone through to produce the oil, what was wiped out to make room for the plantation initially? I suspect the damage is already done 
2125 2018-11-14 20:28:34 What do you use the oil for
2126 2018-11-14 20:28:33 Hair care!!

-I want to cut my hair really short lol 
-get bangs but I’m scared oof 
-try new hairstyles 
-put coconut oil in my hair everyone Friday night

-moisturise my roots

2136 2018-11-14 20:27:49 I just found out that the hospital I work at, where I order three eggs over easy numerous times per week, uses a corn/soybean/canola oil spray on their grill AND eggs so they are easier to flips and serve!!!!

2138 2018-11-14 20:27:18 Flashback to the old house with no legitimate heat source. Our olive oil froze (it had to be given warm water bath to cook!) and we got in great shape because we went to the JCC EVERY day because showering with strangers became preferable to showering at home.
2139 2018-11-14 20:27:11 i stopped using coconut oil on my body months ago when will ppl realize it’s ~actually~ not good for ur skin
2140 2018-11-14 20:26:54 Pues te aconsejo te mueras antes de 2040, Ese año ya no habrá ni gasolina ni gas oil.

2142 2018-11-14 20:26:33 The Chinese only listened to your #IdentityPolitics bullshit to be polite & get you out the door quicker. When you were there did you ask if they want to buy our oil? Alberta has plenty and we're looking for some buyers.

2143 2018-11-14 20:26:28 @TheOceanBasket Hi. I'm told that all your food is fried in palm oil. Are you able to deny this?

2145 2018-11-14 20:26:26 Pretty much, the same thing happened across the mid west with cities who’s entire economies were tied to 1 industry (Cleveland and oil refineries is a good example) had that 1 industry eventually leave, lose a lot of their populations
2146 2018-11-14 20:26:25 @AmbJohnBolton yu have to warn Iraqi prime minister of Ammar Al- hakem plans of  smugling Iranian oil to basrah , already dismatled  MUFTIA Depot , reinstalling near Iranian border , send your drones ,still factory in ERBIL producing tanks  , will finish in 3 weeks time ( 400  ).
2147 2018-11-14 20:26:20 I didnt have mayo for my tuna fish sandwich so I substituted cream cheese and olive oil. Its good.
2148 2018-11-14 20:26:08 Try CBD Oil from Holland & Barratt. Works wonders for me. Helps me sleep and wake up feeling refreshed, calms my mind and has helped massively with anxiety xxx

2150 2018-11-14 20:26:01 Here again I respectfully disagree.

The squeaky wheel gets the most oil.

Although AOC may not have made friends,she was elected on a very progressive platform,NYers plan on holding her to that. She is putting the people who elected her first.
2151 2018-11-14 20:25:58 On a performance chart Trudeau has a failing grade. I can fully understand why Canadians need to elect a Conservative government who will get the job done and abolish the carbon tax and build oil and gas pipelines to foreign markets.
2152 2018-11-14 20:25:50 JM @ #AKRDC2018:  Willow will be a stand-alone facility. We est $2-3B of investment to first production and then $2-3B more for a multi-yr drilling program. First oil could be achieved by 2024-2025.

2154 2018-11-14 20:25:32 Origins oil free moisturizer! Kinda pricy buuuut sooo worth it!!)
2155 2018-11-14 20:25:27 Isn't that just a urinal? Did the urinal flush with anabolic steroids and crude oil?
2156 2018-11-14 20:25:13 I’m getting my oil changed and there’s this girl in front of me that looks EXACLTY like @Abella_Danger im trippin
2157 2018-11-14 20:25:10 Aren't you shocked to also know that the father of that boy was merely compensated with:
(1.) N115,000 = $315.07
(2.) 2 bags of rice
(3.) 1 carton of  
(4.) 1 keg of groundnut oil?  

This is the worth of a Nigerian according to the Buhari/APC-led administration. 

Sad for 
2158 2018-11-14 20:24:56 Diversification is the only option. Oil revenue can't never be sustained.
2159 2018-11-14 20:24:55 JM @ #AKRDC2018:  Also exciting news, GMT2 has been approved! It is sized for up to a 48-well development. Est production is ~35-40,000 BOPD. We are targeting 2021 Q4 for first oil.

ماذا عن الشهيد #جمال_خاشقجي ؟
من أمر بقتله؟
أين جثمانه؟ نريد أن نصلي عليه .. ألم يكن مسلماً؟!
2161 2018-11-14 20:24:43 This war has nothing to do with human rights and saving Syrians. This is about resources. Russia has made a deal with Syria and Iran for their oil. The US needs to implement regime change so they can profit off the oil.
2162 2018-11-14 20:24:43 Use lavender oil, it has the calming and sleep inducing effects, it will helps to improve your sleep quality 
2163 2018-11-14 20:24:35 The rich ones should pay 65% income tax, middle class 25% and lower incomes 20%. College should not be more than $2,500 a year for each individual. This would work. Oil companies should pay climate tax.
2164 2018-11-14 20:24:26 just dropped cbd oil in my kombucha 
2165 2018-11-14 20:24:24 Olive oil is my everything. My skin is soothed and glowing.
2166 2018-11-14 20:24:19 Major reason of wage stagnation for last 30 yrs. Those calling for a $15 min wage will never admit this. Its contradictory to other agendas they have for ignoring illegal immigration on all sides.
2167 2018-11-14 20:24:15 my man Jerome gonna save the day Micky?  did you notice oil and the spx topped out on the day Kashogghi was murdered.  hmm....wonder if that is a coincidence?
2168 2018-11-14 20:24:14 Shetland doesn't have any oil in their 12 mile territorial waters. If they want to be part of North Britain then that's up to them.
2169 2018-11-14 20:24:07 USA need oil at $80
2170 2018-11-14 20:24:05 Pouring some olive oil on bread looks easy enough 
2171 2018-11-14 20:23:54 Missing my dumb oil field job where I don’t have to study anything 
2172 2018-11-14 20:23:49 As a socially insecure preteen, the home remedies my mother would smear in my hair to correct for chlorine damage include but are not limited to:
-ketchup
-mayo
-apple cider vinegar
-egg
-olive oil
-baking soda
2173 2018-11-14 20:23:28 Ingredients= palm oil grown on chopped down rainforests
2174 2018-11-14 20:23:17 Standard Oil says hi.

2178 2018-11-14 20:23:07 It can never be 'just an oil change' can it 
2179 2018-11-14 20:23:02 so guys we’re going healthy & copping essential oil vape (non vape) pens
2180 2018-11-14 20:22:59 One day  

BTW you can order empty gel capsules to put the oil in if your sensitive, or you can put 2-4 drops in Orange juice.
2181 2018-11-14 20:22:53 NO OIL..NO COAL...NO NEW PIPELINES...NO EXPLORATION FOR NATURAL GAS...TRUDEAU LIBERALS..JUST RUNNINIG ON HOT AIR..

2182 2018-11-14 20:22:47 Jamás vi tantas empresas de oil&gas juntas en un mismo lugar como en el centro de Houston.
2183 2018-11-14 20:22:43 Boiled in oil or stepped on by an elephant.
2184 2018-11-14 20:22:40 yoooo my professor literally brought his dab pen to class and I was like oh is that cbd oil and he said “uh no it’s more of the illegal kind” I’m done 
2185 2018-11-14 20:22:39 Very disappointed when checking the ingredients of the sweets for the cinema tonight, almost all of the ones I picked up contain palm oil!
2186 2018-11-14 20:22:39 The Alberta oil sands are not the cause of the fires that occur yearly in California. 
If you are looking to blame the oil industry, look no futher that Californias own oil extraction practices.
2187 2018-11-14 20:22:36 フロントのOIL固めにすれば？
2188 2018-11-14 20:22:23 You must watch CNN. Just what subsidies are you under the illusion the oil companies receive
2189 2018-11-14 20:22:10 Thank you!  I need to try something new, the coconut oil is not doing the job lately
2190 2018-11-14 20:22:07 Get the oil out and let's have a pose down!
2191 2018-11-14 20:21:56 I made the tomato sauce with 14 cups of olive oil in it or whatever and it was divine.
2192 2018-11-14 20:21:55 Funny. As an ex forex trader that went into oil, commodities and sovereign PR im the opposite. I like a bit of grime, the odd drill bit hanging around, plenty of bad language etc. Point is each to their own, we are all different #powerandinfluence
2193 2018-11-14 20:21:54 @BootsUK I use your Expert Skincare day cream, but I've noticed it has Glyceryl Stearate in. Is this derived from Palm Oil?
2194 2018-11-14 20:21:53 I am simply pointing out the folly of throwing away 43 billion a year (14 billion or so to gov't coffers) based on the lie that killing our Oil Industry will help with global warming. A lie you are helping to perpetuate. If it WOULD impact warming, I'd be on your side.
2195 2018-11-14 20:21:49 It smells like oil 
2196 2018-11-14 20:21:45 I tend to just simply pan sear them with salt, pepper, and olive oil. Ribeye is my go to cut.
2197 2018-11-14 20:21:30 I can’t even check my oil without 2-3 cars stopping like “u need help?” I’m good helpful sir..shawty must’ve been lookin chapped..
2198 2018-11-14 20:21:24 WTI #oil closes up today, ending 12th consecutive days of losses -- it has been the longest streak of daily losses since the Nymex light, sweet crude oil futures was launched more than 35 years ago (March 30, 1983)
#Crudeoil #opec
2199 2018-11-14 20:21:24 JM @ #AKRDC2018: GMT1 achieved first oil on Oct 5, two months ahead of schedule. GMT1 is the first drill site on federal leases w/n the NPRA. Provided ~700 jobs during construction and represents ~$725MM in investment.
2200 2018-11-14 20:21:14 If US dollar reverses, it will boost oil stocks further. Any ideas on 3d sector, some stocks look good value for a bounce next 12-24 months
2201 2018-11-14 20:21:13 I think after this, i gonna go back to painting. I really want to try oil painting style.
2202 2018-11-14 20:21:06 And still @IcelandFoods have over 200 items on their shelfs that contain palm oil as they like to give customers a choice. Source- GMB
2203 2018-11-14 20:21:00 Korey Mickie got some oil with him
2204 2018-11-14 20:20:54 I hate you
2205 2018-11-14 20:20:46 Why is it that @IcelandFoods advert featuring the destruction of orangutan habitats for palm oil production is banned but the @WWF advert isn't? Both political in there own rights.
2206 2018-11-14 20:20:45 @Djdubya3 I don’t know where you are coming from. We’ve been taken for a ride by the petrochemical giants who have polluted the world. They now want to frack for oil and gas at our expense. Others destroy forest habitats. We object. You think we’re helping them by objecting?
2207 2018-11-14 20:20:36 I guess the fact that Norway is a MAJOR exporter of Oil and Natural Gas to Europe didn't cross your mind.  40% of the Services the government provides to the Nords is on the back of Fossil Fuel revenues received by that Socialist Country.

But you do you.
2208 2018-11-14 20:20:24 I mean don’t laugh but I love flying out of Bradley. The “expensive” parking is $80/week, but there are so many nearby lots ... one even does oil changes and other minor repairs while you’re gone. There is one decent pub, reasonable selection of direct flights ...
2209 2018-11-14 20:20:23 His fingers hungrily danced along the vial of blueberry-scented oil. One might describe him — recklessly — as sadism.
2210 2018-11-14 20:20:19 Yes, reducing demand will keep oil in the ground. Not sure what you mean by "house of sand" except a rhetorical flourish.

2212 2018-11-14 20:20:18 Mexico has plenty of money. Oil income and drug money. But the people never see any of it. They live in a sewer so bad that San Francisco is a step up living on the streets
2213 2018-11-14 20:20:10 @HaloTopCreamery really disappointed to see palm oil in your list of ingredients 
2214 2018-11-14 20:20:10 هاهااااي
2215 2018-11-14 20:19:50 The repeated and insane attacks against Colombia's oil pipeline (Caño Limon) reveal that the country is not being policed or that it is unpoliceable (what I think) !!
2216 2018-11-14 20:19:48 Cenovus share ownership:
75% institutions
44.5% just four institutions, all American/International (ConocoPhillips, FMR, Capital World Investors, FIL)

2217 2018-11-14 20:19:43 I got six of the belt for rolling an empty oil drum down a hill into the side of the school to see how loud a noise it’d make. It was loud.
2218 2018-11-14 20:19:40 Marlise makes roasted brussels sprouts w/garlic and pecans. I think they're just halved & tossed together w/olive oil, salt & pepper, then placed cut-side down & roasted for awhile, maybe 15-20 min. at 350. Pretty savory.
2219 2018-11-14 20:19:36 Hey climate hawk - What do you think about a class-action lawsuit against the oil companies for climate change damages.
2220 2018-11-14 20:19:30 What does that have to do with my initial point that the oil companies lobby the government and fund republican candidates?
2221 2018-11-14 20:19:29 a lip oil oR, this sounds so weird but when you’re moisturising spread any excess on your lips and push in if that makes sense? ew sorry
2222 2018-11-14 20:19:28 IM SO STOKED THEY HAVE ESSENTIAL OIL LOTION AND CANDLES I WANNA BUY IT ALL
2223 2018-11-14 20:19:25 Definitely she is. This wasn’t an attack on her. The group protesting just wants to ensure that climate change policy isn’t going to be ignored and more importantly, any new policy will include ambitious, challenging, and necessary plans and not written by oil/gas-funded politics
2224 2018-11-14 20:19:24 @IronMenCrosby what’s the palm oil situation up to these days? Is it clear to free run dogs?
2225 2018-11-14 20:19:22 Is the sister still single
2226 2018-11-14 20:19:12 I believe lower oil prices help the market and contribute to a very strong holiday season.
2227 2018-11-14 20:19:12 @jimcramer saying 40s are possible is the lowest call I’ve seen.  I’m not nearly smart enough for the oil market and have no position in anything directly related
2228 2018-11-14 20:19:09 I like Hask a lot for hot oil, and OGX for spray on oil. I like AMLA oil best for jojoba
2229 2018-11-14 20:19:06 I wish this could be a cautionary tale for other researchers and journalists but noooo someone else is going to come along and try and sell this snake oil to evangelicals. 
I’m glad Littman stepped right into her own trap, though.
2230 2018-11-14 20:19:04 You guys sure do use a lot of oil considering you're so opposed to its benefits:
1. Oil for  ship fuel
2. Oil for your plastic canoes
3. Oil for your plastic signs
4. Oil for your clothing, spectacle frames and shoes
5. Oil for your computers and smartphones
Just stop using it!

2235 2018-11-14 20:18:28 Ask Beto O'Rourke. Look carefully at his positions, which call for tighter regulation of fracking and pipelines but not supply cutbacks. He couldn't get elected dog catcher if he took a "keep it in the ground" stance. Ditto in other oil/gas states.
2236 2018-11-14 20:18:23 They could only say that if they’ve never tasted Broighter Gold. So beautiful a taste and so versatile I would never want to use any other type of oil or different variety. #shoplocal #environment #delicious
2237 2018-11-14 20:18:14 lmaooo use Jamaican castor oil
2238 2018-11-14 20:18:14 Lol @ everyone concerned with palm oil all of a sudden but eat animal products which is the main cause of deforestation but who cares cause orangutans are cute and you’re not brain washed into eating that species
2239 2018-11-14 20:18:06 Melatonin every time. 1 a day for 3 days and then take it down to half a day. Add extra CBD oil and lots of grass stroking outaide and you're onto a winner xx

2248 2018-11-14 20:17:17 This is a made up hoax to scare people into taxing-the crap out of oil ! I remember acid rain being the enemy ! I remember global warming being the enemy ! When they could not sell those 2 claims they went to climate change ! What the hell does that mean anyway ??
2249 2018-11-14 20:17:15 The disproven Global Cooling hysteria caused social and economic change, morphed into we're running out of fossil fuels hysteria, now disproven forcing social and economic change morphed into there's LOTS of oil, but now Climate Change requires social and economic changes.

2252 2018-11-14 20:17:06 A fact often overlooked: 'oil market' (in control terms) suffers from huge 'dead bands', long 'over shoots' and deep non-linearities. Far from idealized real time and linearly direct dependent variables. Fast on-line trading and "sentiment" add to the noise... Tough to control

2256 2018-11-14 20:16:48 Just shut the tap off and watch how fast it will climb. Tired of the US trying to destroy our oil and gas industry. In fact, shut off gas, and power as well. Oh and water. Oh and lumber.

Another #MAGA moment as Pres Trump asserts US world dominance.
2259 2018-11-14 20:16:30 The oil itself would not be enough to float you guys. As part of a UK econemy it would negate some negtives from a shit Brexit but thats diffetent than running an entire country with it with the amount you have coming out.
2260 2018-11-14 20:16:19 i HATE getting an oil change because all the dudebros try to talk me into getting every extra thing and I’m too dumb to kno what i actually need
2261 2018-11-14 20:16:12 Nows the time to ban palm oil palm sugar and soya from the far east asap if you value the planet
2262 2018-11-14 20:16:09 I'm saying that aggressively reducing supply AND demand (not studied in the article you linked) will keep the oil in the ground and not increase imports. These analyses about shifting production are built on a house of sand. Reduce supply AND demand and we're on the right track.

2275 2018-11-14 20:14:47 That's true LOL, may be usher needs to pull out his paint brush and give us an oil painting, knowing how usher is, he probably could
2276 2018-11-14 20:14:46 oil, ES, @lebas_janney says flows matter more this time a year than fundamentals.  And when risk off happens, people come to eurodollars for liquidity and DO NOT CARE about price they just have to be long and so you will see overshoots
2277 2018-11-14 20:14:36 Fry it in garlic salt and a bit oil and pepper and honestly its delish xx
2278 2018-11-14 20:14:34 There are some macro and micronutrients that fish can't give. That tells on the overall balance of your hormones and oil production. Eat everything but find a balance. Some foods need to be eaten way less than others. Hang in there.

2283 2018-11-14 20:13:51 @CadburyUK @CadburyWorld I (and my family) will no longer be buying your products due to your use of cheap palm oil. Appreciate my custom is a drop in the ocean for your parent company; but thought you should know.
2284 2018-11-14 20:13:50 It's not like this is some new issue that is suddenly being raised. Tell me again why you don't think they should already have a program that can solve the crisis? I mean I understand why an oil exec doesn't want that, but any liberal should want that.
2285 2018-11-14 20:13:47 I wish I'd realized earlier. I've been supporting the palm oil campaign for months.
2286 2018-11-14 20:13:27 That looks like the soup base packages in the pml brand of ramen I get sometimes, I think spices and some sort of congealed oil
2287 2018-11-14 20:13:27 His account was started yesterday and 100% of his tweets are about city. The level is piss boiled here is immense. Probably one of our proudest achievements! Here’s to oil money 
2288 2018-11-14 20:13:23 Only acceptable scenario would be beard oil and Anadolu.
2289 2018-11-14 20:13:22 Love how everyone is bare all over Iceland advert but is anyone actually gonna cut down on their palm oil use tho?? Probs not. Is anyone gonna eat less meat?? Probs not. Do summat more than tweeting “this needs to be seen”
2290 2018-11-14 20:13:16 *BOFAML: NO LONGER SEES OIL REACHING $95/BBL IN 2019

insightful...
2291 2018-11-14 20:13:07 Obviously that is an issue, but they had quite an advantage with the wide spread nature of the production line in America, plus the fact that the Japanese were heavily reliant on them for oil, so that dented the Japanese war effort
2292 2018-11-14 20:12:57 The guy that put the spoof up is a dick. Doesn't learn does he :)

2293 2018-11-14 20:12:47 What gets the #potstocks sector out of this bad acid trip:
1. M&A/JV announcement of substance ( $APHA / $TRST )
2. Valuation gets crazy compelling for CDN institutional $ to step in (IMO long-term pot >> oil sands !)
3. Broad market rebound (trade deal with China gets done)
2294 2018-11-14 20:12:42 デスリ、ウサポリだけなんでめっちゃ離れたとこからしょっぴくぞって言ってんの？
2295 2018-11-14 20:12:40 China one of the largest important of oil. Less import because of China eco slow down will cut oil price. Again. China is the cause.
2296 2018-11-14 20:12:21 Ideas: 
1. Hop
2. Oil it
3. Remove the mouse that has taken up residence in your boot
4. Wear earplugs
2297 2018-11-14 20:12:18 I called Honda & they told me I got 3 more free oil changes/tire rotations... God is good.
2298 2018-11-14 20:12:10 Gaskiya this  man  allah daiyasa mudace
2299 2018-11-14 20:12:09 Many of them "supply" those "news" to CNN/FOX etc, others listen/read them. So when u present on ground +ve image, they react just like an egg reacts when thrown into boiling oil in a frypan to make omlate :)
2300 2018-11-14 20:12:07 Would you join a class action lawsuit against the oil companies in the United States for damages related to climate change?

Retweet if you would - because with 250 retweets it's possible.
2301 2018-11-14 20:12:06 @Morrisons hi! I love your Morrisons own berry granola however I checked the packaging today for the 1st time and saw that there is palm oil in it - because of this I didn’t buy any. Is there any chance you could reconsider your use of palm oil in Morrisons own products?
2302 2018-11-14 20:12:06 New owners that actually like football.

Not Saudi oil money though. We're a rich club without breaking the rules, and having dirty money on our books.
2303 2018-11-14 20:12:05 So I have fairly debilitating Degenerative Disc Disease. CBD oil has been my saving grace

If you deal with chronic pain or depression/anxiety, I highly recommend CBD oil

I may do a thread on herbal pain relief in a min, because our healthcare system is trash for pain control.
2304 2018-11-14 20:11:54 Goes to show, money does help success and its not all about oil rich clubs or Russian billionaires.
2305 2018-11-14 20:11:49 and has like, a coil in the middle for you to wipe your brush on so that the oil paint gets cleaned out of the brush and you don’t mix colors or muddy them up next time you dip into your palette
2306 2018-11-14 20:11:48 Nah I was talking to the fish oil guy not @cryptominerkid.
2307 2018-11-14 20:11:48 Seriously! guess ur losing ur grip on the slaves not enough moneys coming in? Cause u sure arent for your communities or things would be better but they are not. Walk away ppl this guy is a snake oil salesman
2308 2018-11-14 20:11:46 Like the Iceland ad being "too political" about palm oil. We would rather die than be political.
2309 2018-11-14 20:11:45 I haven't said a cure.. And what am I advertising?..  I have a shitty website I made to entertain maybe 1 out of a 10000.. I am a dyslexic review writer.. Understand?.. I am not selling anything.. I am saying it helps me..  sorry you are not cool about it. is CBD oil ok to you?.
2310 2018-11-14 20:11:44 Zuma had a golden opportunity but I don't think he liked Mavuso that much, oil and water don't mix....
2311 2018-11-14 20:11:44 Really gas is higher????
I guess you didn’t notice the 20$ a barrel fall in oil prices the past couple weeks huh ??
2312 2018-11-14 20:11:41 I’d love a dedicated video on oil paints :)
2313 2018-11-14 20:11:39 Hahaha for one oil shop like that abi. 
2314 2018-11-14 20:11:39 oil the hair faster
2315 2018-11-14 20:11:37 If niggas only knew the value of hash oil, extracts etc niggas would be on but everyone wanna trap trees still y'all know how much these white folks paying for this oil 
2316 2018-11-14 20:11:25 Thx for the reply. How about just not using the palm oil? Have they not looked at alternative sources?  @MishJ1977
2317 2018-11-14 20:11:13 Burning the midnight oil mate? 9am in NZ... good time to be long the $GBP... so yes doing ok mate!
2318 2018-11-14 20:11:10 A terrible take from @byterryjones .  Isn’t that shocking?!!!  He’s such a sycophant to the Oil and Esks. He should just be on the payroll.
2319 2018-11-14 20:11:00 All I came here for was an oil change!!! Don’t recommend nothing !
2320 2018-11-14 20:10:59 I’ve returned car like but I really didn’t feel comfortable driving back with broken clutch and smell of burn oil! Drove straight to office to return this car. I didn’t bother to look for fuel station as I was so worrying of having accident. Now you charged me £25 for 11l fuel!
2321 2018-11-14 20:10:48 You need to oil them ?
2322 2018-11-14 20:10:41 "We need to react quickly to invasive species like we would for a wildfire or an oil spill," says Justin Bush w/ @WAinvasives at the #Montana workshop of the Western Governors' Biosecurity and Invasive Species Initiative
2323 2018-11-14 20:10:36 DUP have seen the proposals.
Gibraltar have seen the proposals.
Scottish Govt? Excluded because they need Our Oil, Fishing, Whisky et al to make ANY kind of deal
We voted 62% to Remain and they expect us to bend over and take it up the botty? 
Well NOT THIS TIME! 
This means War
2324 2018-11-14 20:10:34 Charlotte's Web makes a very good sublingual oil, however it isn't cheap. I paid about 100$ up in Connecticut a couple months ago. Totally worth the price though

2326 2018-11-14 20:10:23 BofAML no longer sees oil hitting $95/bbl in 2019.....
2327 2018-11-14 20:10:13 I agree with you that a war with Iran would be a bad idea, but you really need to stop parroting ignorant propaganda about Syria. As you well know, the US funded & used terrorists including ISIS as strategic assets to destabilize Syria & seize control of their oil fields.
2328 2018-11-14 20:10:07 One year ago today I got the WORST haircut of my life. By the strength of god and castor oil I got my hairline back

2335 2018-11-14 20:09:40 To be honest, I would have taken the deal... But seriously need to know why the guy ran... My best guess, she didn't give him room for negotiation 
2336 2018-11-14 20:09:38 @JustinTrudeau Biggest waste of money by this government is the tax dollars spent on Bombardier,a mismanaged dead horse!Liberals allowing Alberta oil industry to die because of carbon tax,regulatory restrictions and not allowing pipeline to tidewater!Costing BILLIONS of Dollars!

2341 2018-11-14 20:09:02 Discounting oil, we are in an excellent position to remove ourselves from this toxic mess.
2342 2018-11-14 20:09:02 You have no honor ... see skinny bill ... you are a cold nra oil fraud.  And you knew about the 2016 hack

2345 2018-11-14 20:08:47 @POTUS did a LOT to bring the steel, aluminum industries back here. China had it all. Had @POTUS @realDonaldTrump not launched tariffs,  we wouldn't have a steel nor aluminum industry. We need to bring oil,copper,lead,glass back too! Mexico is building Russian tanks now.

2346 2018-11-14 20:08:42 Shouldn't we be glad that Harley is trying to adapt to market forces and technological advancements? They aren't only selling electric motorcycles. You can still buy an "oil and gas" cycle that makes the sound that you are so hot for.
2347 2018-11-14 20:08:39 Eye exam, oil change, therapy, and plasma donating the next two days? ADULTHOOD YOU ARE MY BITCH

2351 2018-11-14 20:08:13 If you want an all over body scrub sugar, a little lemon juice, and whatever essential oil you have for the scent. I use this stuff all the time and I just put it in a mason jar which is no waste
2352 2018-11-14 20:08:08 It surely was, but now it is worst ! And please don’t tell me us make war for liberty or democracy ! It is all about money, oil, and giving jobs by making weapons ...
2353 2018-11-14 20:07:59 目覚めがあまりにも良すぎて逆に気が狂いそう
2354 2018-11-14 20:07:58 Yeah-why WOULD they want the country with the biggest oil reserves in Europe? & gas? & green energy, & whisky?, textiles?, some of the best Unis, some of the most educated citizens.  Do you REALLY think they tolerated the UK for their charm & personality? Get a fkin grip! Numptie
2355 2018-11-14 20:07:55 Low oil price is good! Consumers have more $ 
2356 2018-11-14 20:07:41 
2357 2018-11-14 20:07:41 Thanks Kate. All from the garden too.  But didn’t she invent cooking oil 
2358 2018-11-14 20:07:27 Landlocked? Not even remotely. We have several pipelines and infrastructure that get oil to the St Lawrence and to the Pacific.
2359 2018-11-14 20:07:25 Oil change is the worst thing about being an adult...maybe top 5 actually
2360 2018-11-14 20:07:25 The sacrifices for oil, killing people of color and oppression? No thanks
2361 2018-11-14 20:07:23 I still can't understand why heating (diesel)oil doesn't drive generators to work in the process of supplying heat. Burning money.
2362 2018-11-14 20:07:16 Big Biz,  bad.
Big Pharma, bad.
Big Oil, bad.
Big Ed, good.
2363 2018-11-14 20:07:15 I hope we can find the person while digging for oil
2364 2018-11-14 20:07:14 can we stop consuming palm oil pls its literally destroying the world
2365 2018-11-14 20:07:05 Even if oil prices come back Energy companies have trimmed the fat and become more efficient. The days of golden Friday’s and over staffed departments are gone.
2366 2018-11-14 20:06:58 That's a sh*t just changing the name won't take oil out 
2367 2018-11-14 20:06:53 Thank God we can't hear peoples voices here if not @songstyl_ Would have collected everybody's  babe, just one R Kelly song finish, it's over for the rest of us ...
2368 2018-11-14 20:06:47 I take a sip from my oil, yellow.
It pulled me down to a lower level
2369 2018-11-14 20:06:41 Can't wait for the next prosperity bonus.  Kids dropping out of highschool to make $100k working on the rigs and blowing it all on hookers, blow, jacked up F150's and ATV's.  Why save for tomorrow, oil will save us all!!!!
2370 2018-11-14 20:06:21 Didn't think was a worst regime, but if that is what you think of Trump,,,so be it...most of our oil imports come from USA,
2371 2018-11-14 20:06:19 Not interested in anything that snake oil salesmen has to say
2372 2018-11-14 20:06:18 I need to go get an oil change 
2373 2018-11-14 20:06:14 2 days of argon oil on my face and I think I might actually survive the winter.
2374 2018-11-14 20:06:10 This Wild Growth Oil got me and Cleo fucked up, like nah.
2375 2018-11-14 20:06:03 Thank god the broad shoulders of wastemonster are able to help poor wee stupid Scotland with these oil price drops.
If we were independent we would have to face this terrible burden ourselves.
Good job we have the Barnet handouts to keep us in our place.
2376 2018-11-14 20:05:59 All these people posting about palm oil but still consuming and buying animal products?
2377 2018-11-14 20:05:53 Do they have oil?
2378 2018-11-14 20:05:48 The thing is, palm oil is a good product provided it is farmed responsibly and not by cutting down rainforest.
2379 2018-11-14 20:05:40 Learned a trick from one of Emily's art school friends: put on the masking tape, then seal the edge first with a clear coat (maybe Liquin in the case of oil / polymer medium for acrylic) and then when it's dry, the paint won't seep through. It really works.
2380 2018-11-14 20:05:28 Cos ur oil money mate wish they FFP gets u then ur going back to the old days 8-1
2381 2018-11-14 20:05:17 That a trick question? Vegetable oil dude
2382 2018-11-14 20:05:06 I used blood orange in a beard oil that I made once and it was the wildest thing ever. Citrus is the business.
2383 2018-11-14 20:05:03 and our OIL is still landlocked!! Do something!!
2384 2018-11-14 20:04:57 The best traditional meals out there are made with red oil... 
2385 2018-11-14 20:04:53 Get in touch with us for transmission repair and oil change services.
2386 2018-11-14 20:04:52 can't believe Biscoff contains palm oil :/problematic fave
2387 2018-11-14 20:04:50 After months of being in the “car HOPsital” (Alyssa’s understanding of mechanics) I’m getting my car back today  I promise to stay up to date with oil changes, and not turn up the music louder when the car makes a noise  jk
2388 2018-11-14 20:04:49 I've avoided Cadbury's chocolate for some time because it contains palm oil. However I was pleasantly surprised to see that their new Dark Milk range is palm oil free.
2389 2018-11-14 20:04:33 Actually the thing we are good at.  Oil and gas development and export. If @JustinTrudeau golden trust fund boy ever gets off his butt and moves these projects forward.
2390 2018-11-14 20:04:22 Happens in PA too. Oil and gas industry is never a friend to the state they are raping.
2391 2018-11-14 20:04:21 The simple answer for the majority is Fear of retribution . Having spent years in and out of the Middle East Oil biz I had some limited exposure to female colleagues this is what they told me sadly
2392 2018-11-14 20:04:18 Great now stop using suspect palm oil
2393 2018-11-14 20:04:13 Friday’s my birthday, so I‘ve to have noodles. Off to buy vermicelli, kecap manis, sambal ulek, lap cheong (chorizo de Macau), shallots, fresh turmeric, fresh galangal, sitaw, kutsay, beef, mushrooms. Have achiote oil, garlic, fresh ginger, five spice, carrots, laurel, cilantro.
2394 2018-11-14 20:04:01 Get CBD tinctures if you don't smoke they won't get you stoney at all. There's specific flower and oil strains but they're tricky. Always make sure the CBD is at least double the thc. Speaking from experience the tinctures are the best way to go.
2395 2018-11-14 20:03:59 Being a girl is cool because you can get $20 off your oil change and a free car wash just by smiling at the guy
2396 2018-11-14 20:03:57 I have chronic nerve pain as a side effect from my chronic lymphedema, and the only solution my doc gave me is pain meds. I'm not living the rest of my life that way. I'm looking into CBD oil- can anyone give me any feedback and advice on where to get it, etc?
2397 2018-11-14 20:03:56 Just heard @rushlimbaugh say that oil isn't a finite resource because "the earth makes more and we find it." Also conservation is bad, somehow. There you have it folks, crisis averted. Oh, also @Ocasio2018 is right about Amazon even though she doesn't know why she is, apparently.
2398 2018-11-14 20:03:49 Me to, I am just not sure where the top is, I have been shorting it with DGAZ Man that was a tough oil trade yesterday, I though we had a home run but we got picked off at first base.
2399 2018-11-14 20:03:44 @IcelandRichard Iceland have 10 stores in Spain so I contacted Richard Walker to tell him I've told The Olive Press Spain who will publish the story. No reply from Mr Walker yet, thought he'd be pleased! Maybe Iceland Spain keep Palm Oil there! Hope not!

2401 2018-11-14 20:03:37 Oil reserves will last longer now..
2402 2018-11-14 20:03:36 Well, not a Tesla, but I can get a 2011 Leaf for about $5K. No oil, tranny, or antifreeze fluid changes. No tuneups, belts, hoses. transmission, alternator, starter, Cat. convtr, radiator, wtr pump, coils, oil/air filters, cam belt. No smog tests. Brakes replace. are less too!
2403 2018-11-14 20:03:27 Damn so usually I go to Tire Choice for my oil but they were really busy so I went down the road to Jiffy Lube and paying $10 than I would’ve with Tire choice 
2404 2018-11-14 20:03:07 Trinidad can't call their swamp water something else? Why come for Grenada's oil down? Oil down belongs to Grenada.  Why is this still an argument? This shit is actually bizarre.
2405 2018-11-14 20:03:05 Midweek Service today was for me. @jerrystreams hit a cord. Don't bask in yesterday's laurels. You need fresh oil for fresh exploits. You must never run out of pots for the Holy Spirit to fill.

Covet fresh oil.

Gather more pots.

Selah.
2406 2018-11-14 20:03:01 Dude I don't know what you are talking about  we are here to make friends
2407 2018-11-14 20:02:58 Wait, how long has local furniture magnate Manny had his own olive oil?!?!
2408 2018-11-14 20:02:56 Now google another map showing USA and NATO military bases and another map showing countries bombed by the USA for oil and regime change in favor of looting resources like the case of Congo.
2409 2018-11-14 20:02:51 Did the Gogeta v Vegito end, damn I wanted to throw more oil in the fire
2410 2018-11-14 20:02:40 A quick Ctrl-F reveals the words 'customs' appears 256 times...could be burning the midnight oil!
2411 2018-11-14 20:02:30 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2412 2018-11-14 20:02:29 She's got oil smeared all over her face from working on her mech.

Sips a nano cola.
2413 2018-11-14 20:02:24 How about....

Class action lawsuits (localize the concept to your region... so legal action) against the oil companies in every country of the world with the entire population named as plaintiffs.

#climateaction
2414 2018-11-14 20:02:15 CBD oil is my savior for any kind of stress/anxiety related situations
2415 2018-11-14 20:02:11 Have you contacted other supermarkets to join in the anti Palm Oil campaign?
2416 2018-11-14 20:02:05 A book, pajama set from marshalls/tj max, gift cards, oil diffuser, fuzzy socks
2417 2018-11-14 20:02:03 First bottles of olive oil, now chocolate jewellery (?) lucky you! Though earned by hard graft, I know. I hope the chocolate gem is as big as it looks on Twitter!

2422 2018-11-14 20:01:29 Too bad she doesn't have the backing of our federal government. Trudeau is also in favor of land locking out oil,  just like the American anarchists.

Oil be dropping but I don't see your fares dropping. What you only increase when oil goes up but don't decrease when it goes down?

Where are the complaints now?
2424 2018-11-14 20:01:12 Well done Mark I've contacted The Olive Press, Spain's leading Newspaper for Brits & they will run the story & share. We don't need saturated fatty Palm Oil when we have Olive Oil, Sunflower & Oil seed plus veggie oils! Have also shared to the USA. @IcelandRichard
2425 2018-11-14 20:01:07 As long as the Nic-wax you're using is approved for down. You'll also want to make sure to use a down-safe detergent, many regular detergents can strip the oil off the down, compounding the clumping problem.

2428 2018-11-14 20:01:02 A positive signal: US markets react to Theresa May’s progress with her Brexit plan and oil price inching up. Up sharply from a low of -1.5%.

Nobody attack Pelosi, are you saying that AOC by attacking Big Oil is attacking Pelosi?
2456 2018-11-14 19:58:58 No fund blew up and hit the oil market yday you simply had a mass of people trying to sell oil at the same time bc most funds have the same risk management and or stops. 
I love how all these anonymous people on twitter tell you Wall Street and hedge fund rumors from their house
2457 2018-11-14 19:58:42 Just marinate them in something. Oil them up!

2459 2018-11-14 19:58:26 Lol...utter nonsense. Texas's economy was booming when oil was 40 $ a barrel. The Texas economy is highly diversified and supply side initialves are responsible.

2464 2018-11-14 19:58:09 Because Libs wouldn't drill in Alaska, and oil is our lifeblood. Now that we are drilling, need refineries. Then POTUS can undercut them, and defund Terrorism as well.

Once there was The Rose  Committee and the oil companies got together to organize their shutdowns. Then the lawyers got involved called it collusion and deemed it illegal what is this guy talking about? If that was collusion then so must what he is saying

2470 2018-11-14 19:57:40 I’m pleased that this issue is being addressed in earnest, though I’m skeptical of top- down economic solutions offered by those who aren’t involved in the micro industries that would be a driving force in an alternative economy; one where the U.S. dollar wasn’t backed by oil.

2483 2018-11-14 19:56:00 Including part production, they still use less oil overall compared to ripping it out of the ground for decades indefinitely.

We use petroleum to build the parts but that’s better than burning it! It’s a small price to pay in order to save the planet and lower electricity prices
2484 2018-11-14 19:55:50 Then why are fossils Kayla.   Wtf is oil.  It’s dead dinosaurs.
2485 2018-11-14 19:55:36 Wasted effort I'm afraid.  Trudeau has said many times he wants to kill the oil and gas industry in Canada and his actions prove that out.  PET and now 'Jr' showing their hate for Alberta.
2486 2018-11-14 19:55:30 yup

2492 2018-11-14 19:54:40 Oh give us a break , just sit back and watch the fireworks kids. This company is going to leave a trail of destruction of former big car companies, will strangle big oil and the shorts will be hung from street lights

2496 2018-11-14 19:54:30 I thought about that but tbh thats just a waste and the yolk is simply disgusting alone... so just mash em up with ton of olive oil and season that bitch. If u are a nasty person, add avocadosss. I HATE those. Lol.

2501 2018-11-14 19:53:59 I like $50, but $40 wouldn't surprise as it over corrects. My thinking is some of this is due to Trump's bluster with Iran, etc., but high oil prices brings high gas and that's not winning for Trump.

2504 2018-11-14 19:53:47 Get briefed by the CA Association of Firefighters, or CA Gov. Jerry Brown. They know what's going on.  FEMA admitted they weren't prepared for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, and Zinke can't find his ass with both hands, unless he has an oil company contract taped to it.
2505 2018-11-14 19:53:44 It's unethical for @GlobalRegina to feature this story without disclosing who has funded the "researcher"S work in the recent past. Hint: It's Big Oil.

2506 2018-11-14 19:53:30 So you want to know what YOU can do about climate change!

Do you need a PERSONAL action!

2510 2018-11-14 19:53:17 I know all of this, I worked for her. But in the grand scheme of politics, oil expansion isn’t the answer and will never be the answer. An ideal world is one in which all countries move away from oil and when some of most influential aren’t doing so no one else will.
2511 2018-11-14 19:53:14 Mike, this is why I once asked you if @realDonaldTrump would fix Venezuela. This is a national security issue and the Chinese are getting too close through the country with the biggest oil reserves

2517 2018-11-14 19:52:17 I shall be trying to avoid anything with Palm Oil, however companies have to be more transparent about what they are selling. Thank goodness for Iceland... Not the largest yet, but seems to be the most ethical. I know where I shall be shopping
2518 2018-11-14 19:52:15 and lets not forget about the leather in their cars, the palm oil in their home products, and the fact that avocados, melons, and some squashes arent even vegan because you NEED bees in order to grow them.

2522 2018-11-14 19:51:58 Pelosi wants a transition to fracked oil products and natural gas that has been billed as clean, then when she’s dead we can move to harnessing renewable green energy, like the sun, wind and ocean tides.

2555 2018-11-14 19:49:32 Houseknecht: The "surface has not yet been scratched" in terms of finding out how much oil is in these formations (Nanshuk and Torok). #akrdc2018
2556 2018-11-14 19:49:19 Congratulations.  Now maybe you could focus on your palm oil usage and save the orangutans from suffering.....

2558 2018-11-14 19:48:51 Maybe a contributing factor is China/India coal. Mid East oil. But ya let’s kill Canada’s number one export instead because it’s an easy target right.
2559 2018-11-14 19:48:40 my car is more needy than a boyfriend 
*last week: battery and wiper 
*today: oil change and alignment 
*next week: new tires
2560 2018-11-14 19:48:22 Just payed $60 for a oil change 
2561 2018-11-14 19:48:12 Cheap oil is good for the economy, but oil needs to be at a price that supports producers and promotes exploration.
2562 2018-11-14 19:48:06 "Thou prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies, Thou anointed my head with Oil..."

2563 2018-11-14 19:47:49 did them same as marmite spuds;  par boil - drain - coat in warm oil and marmite - put on baking tray - chuck in hot oven.
2564 2018-11-14 19:47:43 This dude consciously manipulates millions of people for a living so he can get rich. People have uprooted their lives based on his charismatic snake oil. It's hard not to think he's a sociopath

2570 2018-11-14 19:47:19 Why are you still on the TV? You were knifed by Brown, and we’re still drowning in your PFI debt Ponzi schemes, mired in your oil wars... and yet someone somewhere still gives you the oxygen of publicity.
2571 2018-11-14 19:47:08 It might be but it sounds so hypocritical now coming from the USA.The two standards that are used to measure & treat your friends & measure countries you don't care about  or has no oil is a sad standard. It creates a mistrust,specially when done in public.Hopefully it's a start.
2572 2018-11-14 19:46:52 Walmart Buggies Need Tunes-Ups And A Oil Change Too!!! 
2573 2018-11-14 19:46:49 U.S. oil prices finish higher to end a record losing streak

2577 2018-11-14 19:46:36 Here is a tweet about work.

Natural Gas is nearly $5.00/mcf and that is really awesome for the oil and gas industry.
2578 2018-11-14 19:46:34 Fuck sake it’s actually annoying that I use specifically “oil free” and products that are matte and I still get shiny 
2579 2018-11-14 19:46:34 I really thought cars get oil changes for free 
2580 2018-11-14 19:46:24 Lower prices squeeze Iranians and Russians. 
Iranians instead of having open access to market must tranship through waivered parties  which increases costs of getting oil into the market.

2582 2018-11-14 19:46:09 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
2583 2018-11-14 19:46:04 This is good news. Can you please update us on where you are with palm oil?
2584 2018-11-14 19:45:53 How many times do the Dem leaders have to get out-maneuvered and/or ripped off by the GOP before you consider it a compelling argument? How many of Trump's judges confirmed? How much oil money? FFS. The reasons are so obvious, they may as well sleep in your bed.
2585 2018-11-14 19:45:51 'Scotland's Future' expicitly (over-exaggeratedly) set-out the reliance on oil in a future separate Scotland's economy. If you didn't read it, more fool the Greens. If you did then advised us to vote Yes, the same level of idiocy applies. With or without oil, sep Sco is madness.
2586 2018-11-14 19:45:33 "With all the coal in the core,
all the water and the oil,

With the soil that you borrow,
and the moral you deny,
you can buy the eyes of the world."
2587 2018-11-14 19:45:28 Just discovered @mrkiplingcakes French Fancies contain palm oil. That’s the last time I eat those then #irresponsible #morals
2588 2018-11-14 19:45:21 Put too much olbas oil on me and now my eyes are streaming and I still can’t breathe properly owww

2591 2018-11-14 19:45:14 Bitcoins still still seems to hold up pretty well against stocks, oil and USD ;-) after testing 6k for months the fall from here will be huge !
2592 2018-11-14 19:45:08 i see i'm not the only one who likes scented candles or maybe oil burners in their office.
2593 2018-11-14 19:45:01 I wonder if the size of the "button box" mass-production has out-run the deliciousness of Danish butter?  Not all butter is created equal (and veg oil is definitely no sub)!
2594 2018-11-14 19:45:00 Monday saw oil’s largest one-day drop in three years, securing its longest losing streak on record.

2599 2018-11-14 19:44:34 Roasted Root veggies -easy & healthy- cut up colorful root veggies add salt/pepper/olive oil & bake rather than sweet potatoes/marshmellows on it. 

Stouffer's Corn Bread stuffing just add in dried cranberries & Walnuts the last few minutes of cooking. Use ckn stock not water
2600 2018-11-14 19:44:32 If Ju$tin was really tough, he would ban Saudi oil imports to Canada and protest their place on the Women's Rights Council at the UN. He likes to talk a lot but hasn't the spine to back it up IMO

2606 2018-11-14 19:43:08 No surprise. He’s a snake oil salesman
2607 2018-11-14 19:43:04 Try neem oil in a spray bottle. It’s an organic option
2608 2018-11-14 19:42:58 Using buttermilk to coat the flour is very helpful. Also making sure the oil is the right temperature so that the inside can cook properly but the outside is not over cooked
2609 2018-11-14 19:42:56 You prop up a party that advocates oil production
2610 2018-11-14 19:42:42 Haha so all the oil companies, pharmaceutical companies, and all the other companies screwing over the little guy will keep peddling money to congressman but nobody will bat an eye. God forbid planned parenthood to try to keep senators who actually care about what they do
2611 2018-11-14 19:42:37 They cannot relate to each other. Michelle Obama has a harvard law degree, and Melania is just a high class escort golddigger. The two are like oil and water.

2622 2018-11-14 19:41:23 Snake oil salesmen alert 
2623 2018-11-14 19:41:21 ...as is coal & oil. There will always be a market for all 3, but not on the scale of the 20th century.  Those who work in those formerly-robust industries should be well-paid : there just won’t be as many of them. The future will be a mix of solar, wind, hydro, nuclear & ???
2624 2018-11-14 19:41:15 @waitrose just eaten your Classic Steak Pie’. Horrible, and tasteless. Anything to do with the palm oil in it? Expected better!

2629 2018-11-14 19:40:52 I hate cooking with oil , I feel like ima lost my hand every time I get next to the pan to flip whatever I’m frying. 
2630 2018-11-14 19:40:46 Go peddle your snake oil somewhere else.

I'm not buying.
2631 2018-11-14 19:40:41 Also, goverment airdrops? That took me by surprise. They probably took that idea from DayZ what with its helicopter crash sites. Wasn't the US goverment eradicated during the war? Save for the Enclave on that oil rig.
2632 2018-11-14 19:40:41 I think it might have sustainable palm oil in it
2633 2018-11-14 19:40:34 Yes, Zinke has the solution--get rid of old forests, build roads everywhere, & convert from forests & grasslands to oil wells & coal pits.
2634 2018-11-14 19:40:34 PRIVATE companies have spent this on oil not the government. Talk to them this is not a political issue. #cdnpoli

2639 2018-11-14 19:40:17 Hi,  We'd like to assure you that we're as concerned as you are about this, which is why we're committed to the responsible sourcing of Palm Oil. We're members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),
2640 2018-11-14 19:40:13 that's pretty close to what I see, too, except it won't necessarily be *our* state that controls our means of production. China, Saudi Arabia, US.
Post National, after all.
I have a suspicion that they are keeping our oil price down until the pieces are in place - probably 2020.
2641 2018-11-14 19:40:12 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil, yeah they're gonna dig a coal-face!
Out of you.

 - Olympic infrastructure

We have lots of sun & wind to displace oil but no leaders.
'No' is bad.
2655 2018-11-14 19:39:00 The rollover in housing,autos,semis,oil among other things,along with accelerating weakness overseas is becoming so obvious that even the blind man Powell will soon recognize it.I suspect we will see a pause in the tightening cycle soon.U.S./China relations could also play a role
2656 2018-11-14 19:38:57 my oil target is 28 within the next 16 months could be a lot sooner based on a 25 yr cart we are in a bear move to go test 28 ...again as we did in 2008 most oil co will go bankrupt but tis x it's NOT coming back long $OILD  sort strength it could bounce to 62 is but tats it

2660 2018-11-14 19:38:25 Can I also add, speaking as a retailer, that I will stop selling ALL Mondelez products at the end of November unless & until you change your palm oil use policy
2661 2018-11-14 19:38:23 We can replace oil with solar energy. Creating new jobs and replacing old ones. The sun is the biggest energy source and will never run out of power. That along with wind turbine and hydroelectric power. Or a dam, and could potentially reverse global warming.
2662 2018-11-14 19:38:20 When you have ships sailing endlessly full of oil because nobody wants them has been going for years but the prices kept going up. How can they expect prices to keep going up with an over abundance?

2664 2018-11-14 19:38:05 After backing a low life liar and fear monger, racist and self-proclaimed molester of women. Not to mention setting up our national lands for his cronies to drill oil and giving them all 30% tax breaks with us barely getting anything. Republicans will never be trusted again.

2672 2018-11-14 19:37:19 Conservatives love the military and they only get a benefit when the US invades a random country for their oil and minerals.
2673 2018-11-14 19:37:15 Up next: David Houseknecht with the .@USGS will talk about the Nanushuk and Torok oil formations, both of which have created excitement and generated new interest in Alaska's oil patch. #akrdc2018

2675 2018-11-14 19:36:51 Venezuela is not in trouble because of socialism. It failed because it depended entirely on oil for exports. If a company owned the oil, then the economy would still crash and burn when oil prices fell. Especially if the company had terrible management
2676 2018-11-14 19:36:51 Cop tea tree oil and sea salt and you’ll be fine. Mine took like 3 weeks to heal
2677 2018-11-14 19:36:44 Wow, I can't believe I just got blocked for commenting that animal agriculture destroys the rainforest too. I thought people cared about the rainforests. It's not just being destroyed by palm oil. Feeding grain to animals destroys more rainforest than palm oil. It all matters.

2679 2018-11-14 19:36:04 You don't get it at all.  We'd have no bitumen mining or SAGD without the NEP. Lougheed got a good deal there, for the day.

2681 2018-11-14 19:35:50 Had this discussion at the time with your joint convenor on Leith Walk. She said as the oil was coming out anyway, may as well use it... Of course deny it later but that was the deal Nigel, you went with Yesnp. No need to re-write recent history.
2682 2018-11-14 19:35:49 (tbc) is, just through the inclusion of the "whale oil."

My only criticism is the title-- I was.... very worried when I saw the title and that it (tbc)

2686 2018-11-14 19:35:31 @LindaFoods I've been buying your products for years not realising the #PalmOil used is contributing to deforestation & harming indigenous people & animals. I will no longer buy them and will find alternatives. Using unsustainable palm oil contradicts your original company ethos.
2687 2018-11-14 19:35:29 #ItsTime to #ProtectOurCoast
 Help us amplify this message  
Congress has the power to stop Trump's dangerous giveaway to the oil industry. Tell them to stand up to this reckless plan and protect all of us from expanded offshore drilling because #ItsTime to #ProtectOurCoast!

2690 2018-11-14 19:35:14 Tony Blair stoke some of the Scottish waters years ago and 7 oil wells with it.
2691 2018-11-14 19:35:04 My $0.02 on AVs: malware == HIV, AVs == snake oil (bad) or HAART (good) -- help w/ side FX; are profitable (SaaS); can't truly "solve" malware. Better security-minded engineering of systems is needed, but even that won't solve ALL problems (arms race!).
2692 2018-11-14 19:35:03 His businesses thrive in peacetime unlike the Bush's and Clinton's link to arms and oil which thrives in conflict.
2693 2018-11-14 19:35:01 The gas you’re pumping now was refined and transported when oil was a different price. It wasn’t produced and refined instantaneously based on today’s price.
2694 2018-11-14 19:34:56 Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:CRZO) had its price target lowered by analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. from $30.00 to $27.00. They now have a "neutral" rating on the stock. 56.5% upside from the current price of $17.25.
2695 2018-11-14 19:34:56 Oh the poor baby  have you tried CBD oil? X
2696 2018-11-14 19:34:53 Sadly, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Make sure you cry, whine, sob, weep, complain, repeatedly call and make yourself an absolute nuisance until he is diagnosed and treated.  Try not to let them dismiss it.
2697 2018-11-14 19:34:34 #WTI #Crude #Oil ends 1% higher.  The streak is over.
2698 2018-11-14 19:34:28 I’ve heard flat oil prices are the true signal 
2699 2018-11-14 19:34:12 WTI oil trades at  US$56.23/barrel while Canadian oil WCS is trading at US$16.08 /barrel a discount of 40%. Canadians are losing a ton of money.
2700 2018-11-14 19:34:06 Great. All we need to try & end these oil wars. Mr Hackett, facts are that, how they are used is something very Different. Can you put in numbers, number of civilians killed, democracies overthrown, wars of the USA since WWII?
2701 2018-11-14 19:34:04 Anything tea tree oil or mint is good for your scalp
2702 2018-11-14 19:34:03 do better. drink your water. oil your hair. do face masks. have a skin care routine. workout. moisturize. eat healthier. be kind. read books. just be a better human being
2703 2018-11-14 19:34:01 Interesting article considering the US is producing more oil than we can use right now 
2704 2018-11-14 19:33:48 Gotcha. We go to Pensacola and PCB and love it, but we're not fishers. I've had some tasty Gulf-caught tuna and snapper, but I imagine the deeper waters and fewer oil rigs make for better deep sea fishing in the Atlantic?
2705 2018-11-14 19:33:48 Good job Mr. President however we still need solar roadways in order to get off the Saudi oil. Besides, The FDR/Trump Interstate will provide heated, lighted energy providing roads for many generations to come.
2706 2018-11-14 19:33:47 Greater oil supply means lower prices; and lower prices means more money in the pocket; and more money in the pocket means more opportunity to exercise one's economic freedom, be that saving more, traveling more, shopping more, etc. Yes, indeed, what is wrong with that?
2707 2018-11-14 19:33:43 My dad just taught me how to do an oil change :,) bless this man
2708 2018-11-14 19:33:28 Elite shouldn't be too hard to farm. Though perhaps a bit costly with oil...
2709 2018-11-14 19:33:14 I’m on the side that doesn’t want wars. I can blame the US because they just start wars just to overthrow governments and steal their resources. We helped France take some of Libya’s oil, influence in North Africa and help their military reassert its position in the world.
2710 2018-11-14 19:33:11 We can all do something too. I keep 5 bins to sort garbage, I buy food locally, wine and oil in reusable 5l jugs, I don't drive when I can avoid it..There is no way to pass significant legislation thru Sen in January, so let's buy us time and get the Sen+ WH on our side next time

2713 2018-11-14 19:32:57 I just bought wild growth oil today. I’m calling bullshit on it but we gon see
2714 2018-11-14 19:32:42 If oil is gonna run out and we all die by 2062 who wants to bet that the oil-mongers rely on the 99% to fear global warming and to develop solutions. They'll wait until the last minute to invest their billions in environmentally friendly alternatives and remain the elite.
2715 2018-11-14 19:32:39 How many of you after watching the Iceland advert are going to continue to still consume products with palm oil in it? I hope to god that no one had shared that advert without taking a lesson away from it. Remember- NO PALM OIL IS SUSTAINABLE. #CrueltyFree
2716 2018-11-14 19:32:37 I wish somebody can come get me while my car get a oil changed don’t want to wait  but I don’t have no ppl here 
2717 2018-11-14 19:32:36 Hey it's cool how y'all completely ignored the point that Obama presided over a massive increase in oil production after he bailed out the banks that profit off it
2718 2018-11-14 19:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
2719 2018-11-14 19:32:30 Noble Jerky & E&C’s heavenly hunks! I also really like these chips cooked in avocado oil but I’ll have to look at the brand when I get home!

2723 2018-11-14 19:31:44 @niyazee26 are you guys economists as I cant find your esteemed name in any economic school. The oil prices are future contracts. Govt is not buying crude on NYMEX. The impact comes atleast 2 3 months after. @Razarumi i had my doubts but I thought you were impartial
2724 2018-11-14 19:31:29 @realDonaldTrump Stock was going to be great. Well instead it looks like something dying. Big loses continue. Negotiate big trade deals, nope never happened. More Oil doesn't mean cheaper gas, no new refineries have been built in over 20 years.
2725 2018-11-14 19:31:28 Could not agree with you more. Being an Oil fan since 72. I have seen it all. Except for those few cup years, this is the kind of up and down hockey we should come to expect. If you became a fan after the Cup years, things have been bleak indeed.

2730 2018-11-14 19:30:54 yesterday was clearly someone blowing up on a long oil, short nat gas position
2731 2018-11-14 19:30:52 Ewww you know those sewing kit cookies? The Danish butter cookies in a tin? They taste like crap, obviously using less butter and more vegetable oil now. So gross.
2732 2018-11-14 19:30:49 Nop bawani , duk karya sukeyi, they want to remain young
2733 2018-11-14 19:30:41 @AlbertaatNoon 
I find this curious I sat in on a talk Markham H. gave and it was the oil producers that asked for unlimited production. They were given unlimited production and gave the Eco Warriors all of their other demands. So logic would suggest they can restrict themselves
2734 2018-11-14 19:30:37 Sadly this leans too far to the extremist and inaccurate notions of the divestment movement., with appeals to divest from oil within 5 years.
2735 2018-11-14 19:30:35 @HealthRanger If I start taking Black Seed Oil capsules, can I discontinue the krill oil? Don’t want to take 2 similar oils....

Mars is a no as well

Unless you're going to start having vegan chocolate then most are no.

Vegan chocolate does taste like non vegan, no difference apart from milk and palm oil

2744 2018-11-14 19:30:11 The loss of #oil exports and the jobs that will happen and the negativity because ppl attribute it to economy won't fill the coffee can.

2747 2018-11-14 19:29:46 Roast cauliflower? Break into small florets, parboil for a couple of mins, drain, toss in oil - maybe some spice - roast for 10-15mins - add some grated Parmesan and roast for a few more.
2748 2018-11-14 19:29:46 and a gallon of cooking oil ... LoL
2749 2018-11-14 19:29:35 Had one in the Sri Lankan jungle, which i thought was amazing. The wife (who had palm oil poured into her hair) felt it was like a back street abortion clinic.

Is this fund exposure adjustments for YE, going into 2019?
2752 2018-11-14 19:29:21 So many possibilities! Stir fry with garlic and soy; make into a basic soup with onion softened in butter/oil, potato + stock; toss with oil then dry in oven till crispy, season with salt, sugar, and five spice; blanch and stir into pasta with tomato sauce...

2759 2018-11-14 19:28:59 I wish a supermarket in the UK would do a Xmas ad on the critically endangered Scottish Wildcat & see it go viral. I'm a huge supporter of Iceland's message & I've been trying to cut out palm oil. However there are over 100,000 Orangutans in the wild compared to 35 Scot Wildcats
2760 2018-11-14 19:28:58 You’re forgetting Pikuach Nefesh. Carrying is common in israel on Shabbat by Orthodox Jews who understand the present danger. I honestly don’t recall a Shabbat in Israel when someone didn’t bring a firearm to shul in our community.

2764 2018-11-14 19:27:45 I remember 10 or 15 years ago they were saying the ocean would only contain jellyfish by now. What happened to that? And what about the gulf oil spill being the end?

2768 2018-11-14 19:27:24 There is cheaper and then is stupid cheaper. Stable wti at around $65 is good for everyone. U.S. producers are make a profit and EXPORT too. Under $60 wti sucks.

And remember back to oil price war - consumers didnt do squat with the few extra bucks, BUT tons of jobs LOST
2769 2018-11-14 19:27:23 McConnell talks bipartisanship, now that the Dems win a majority in the House, but when was the last time he *practiced* bipartisanship?  Let’s see.... how about anything to do w/SCOTUS? Blocking D appointments? Exercising the “nuclear option”? Hypocrisy. He’s selling snake oil.

We don't have institutions here .
2776 2018-11-14 19:26:55 Ok now we are on the same biblical page, Cain is the offspring of the ole serpent.  So if we look at Cain and his curses, the only group this fits is whites, The Mark of Cain is white skin.  The Strength of the Earth is Oil, not agriculture and whitey kills everything in his path

2781 2018-11-14 19:26:28 It’s going to 12 or 14 or whatever. ratio with oil gonna go inverse too.

2787 2018-11-14 19:25:48 OK, But let’s work to end 80% of that demand for oil over the next five years.
2788 2018-11-14 19:25:45 Theirs is the story of the Ten virgins.  Five were wise and five foolish.. They slept off and forgot to buy extra oil for their lambs.

2791 2018-11-14 19:25:36 Ah, the futility argument. We need to keep oil and gas in the ground. This keeps it in the ground. If we are aggressively reducing demand we can ramp back on supply and not increase imports.
2792 2018-11-14 19:25:31 Who me? Traders point to Pierre Andurand's Andurand Capital causing the plunge in oil prices but the hedge-fund manager denies.
“It was nothing to do with us..I do not think the move is related to large funds in trouble.”
2793 2018-11-14 19:25:31 I just bought a PHEV. Going full electric in 3-4 years. If we want to support poor nations, we should help them harness the power and profit of green energy. Oil is dead.

2796 2018-11-14 19:25:18 8.8 jobs are created for every $1M of climate investments, compared to 1.6 jobs per $1M from oil/gas #JustTransitionCA
2797 2018-11-14 19:25:08 Not my view, the need to keep the oil & gas unburnt is just science. My view is that wholesale socialist transformation is the solution.

And the Tories are not good faith actors. Not even remotely close to that. They know what they are saying doesn't add up. They don't are.
2798 2018-11-14 19:25:07 You could but it will dry it out! Olive oil or butter is better
2799 2018-11-14 19:24:59 I really had other things to do this afternoon than wait almost 3 hours on an “express service” oil change. Thanks @Nissan #waiting #stillwaiting #service

2801 2018-11-14 19:24:52 We are still failing to run a Solar Energy plant, now imagine turning coal into oil bro.... Maybe in 100 years
2802 2018-11-14 19:24:50 Nothing to do with PM. Yet with oil sands industry that did not plan ahead with due diligence. In fact Industry was aware of the obstacles yet thought that with enough political pressure they would go away.

2806 2018-11-14 19:24:06 Haba! For What? I just poured engine oil,feel free to slide in
2807 2018-11-14 19:24:02 That's cool, but it's far from the Main school.
2808 2018-11-14 19:23:45 NATO issued the following statement:

“HNoMS Helge Ingstad was involved in a collision with the Maltese oil tanker Sola TS in Norwegian waters around 0400 this morning (8 Nov) while sailing inner Fjords for navigation training."

Oh the irony.
2809 2018-11-14 19:23:39 didn’t have to pay for my gas, oil change or car wash
2810 2018-11-14 19:23:33 If imported oil rises faster than inflation, capital is certainly gaining.
2811 2018-11-14 19:23:32 Loool. I don't even know what to say. So you actually believe that Obj can be financially induced by Atiku.
You didn't even suggest Oil Wells... na credit alert. Smh.

2813 2018-11-14 19:23:03 The concept of Earth First Strike suggests that a major power should launch a series of nuclear missile strikes against oil production sites to reduce global dependende on fossil fuels.
2814 2018-11-14 19:23:00 At the car dealership for an oil change & a good look evaluation to make sure all is good. I really hate the car maintenance thing Definitely not use to doing this at all!!

2816 2018-11-14 19:22:50 Europe has pipelines for their beer?? Laid alongside utility lines. Dear, Santa (@JustinTrudeau), I would like my pipeline (that you bought for me) to have beer in it if it can’t have oil. Thank you. #tmx
2817 2018-11-14 19:22:35 Except, Vivian, that most of our oil is exported, so we're not using it to support a dispersed, cold population. And Russia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia, Finland all have per capita GHG emissions lower than us, some quite significantly - a mere fraction.

2827 2018-11-14 19:21:51 hello from the girl who woke up late and could only take a half ass shower and forgot she put coconut oil in her hair last night and now shes in her law school class where she's on call with coconut oil in her hair. 8 y/o me is crying on the inside and 25 year old me is laughing
2828 2018-11-14 19:21:50 it’s raining outside and it sounds like when you got the oil on too hard and it starts popping as soon as you drop something in there
2829 2018-11-14 19:21:49 When are we going to see the palm oil free/sustainable palm oil logo on your products?

She’s a 15w40
2831 2018-11-14 19:21:22 @cvpayne BOTH of these guys are DEAD WRONG on #oil. Oil is down in 1 month because Saudi's, Russia and even U.S> producers were pumping like crazy to compensate for #Iran sanctions. Sanctions NEVER happened - HUGE OVER SUPPLY.
@realDonaldTrump wanted this and he screwed the pooch
2832 2018-11-14 19:21:11 ATTENTION LADIES if you have excruciating pains on your period like I do (I literally can’t get out of bed and my hands twitch sometimes) and midol or ibuprofen isn’t enough, then using CBD oil/CBD lotion on top of it helps a LOT to take away the pain from cramps!!!
2833 2018-11-14 19:21:04 What about the use of palm oil in your products?
2834 2018-11-14 19:21:03 All 3 levels of govt are broke, borrowing comes at a cost. Wallets are empty, Olympics would not create long term wealth or better quality of life . Good middle class jobs are needed and more pipelines and less OPEC oil in Canada..
2835 2018-11-14 19:20:53 .@thedemocrats Obama said that he couldn't do anything about gas prices going up, so why is Trump negotiating with the gas/oil companies and gas prices are lowering? Because Democrats lie about what they can and cant do for Americans and poor who buy gas to get to work.
2836 2018-11-14 19:20:47 Im sitting outside and this woman 20 feet away from me is using olive oil so potent I can smell it from here 

need me a freak like that
2837 2018-11-14 19:20:45 One thing I wonder though is that, yes, sunflower oil would take up more land, but it's able to do so in less rich ecosystems. If sunflowers can grow on land that's not as valuable and rare as tropical forests, isn't that worth the tradeoff?
2838 2018-11-14 19:20:44 Geez, the conman chose a snake oil salesman....

2844 2018-11-14 19:20:05 Yes - and I remember the oil embargo of the early 1970s. Gas was 79 cents per gallon. Everyone was saying that "Once the price hits $1 per gallon" things will level off. We had to use even/odd days and wait in long lines for gas.
2845 2018-11-14 19:20:00 On an enviro/econ basis, the addition of supply constraints probably would accomplish little except increase imports. On a political basis, it would deliver to the GOP oil/gas swing states such as TX, NM, PA, OH, CO, MT - and could pull the GOP back from the dead in California.
2846 2018-11-14 19:19:59 Do you oil too?
2847 2018-11-14 19:19:57 Where can I get coconut oil in this Kaduna?
2848 2018-11-14 19:19:57 The Sunflower Fields. The flowers in these fields point towards your heart's most ardent desire. The oil made from the seeds of these flowers is said to create the strongest love potion in the multiverse.
2849 2018-11-14 19:19:45 Oh ok Venn.
I am nt eat alot oil food n fry items .
2850 2018-11-14 19:19:40 Unrealistic expectation for a total ban anytime soon. Many Canadian communities continue to depend on diesel, coal, and oil as electric sources. These need to be shifted to renewable first before even considering pushing electric vehicles in those areas.
2851 2018-11-14 19:19:30 Yes, good point. Often it's not just a matter of 'choice'. Oil palm is tied up with economic necessity, development, power dynamics at difft levels, ideology...and all that makes it politically loaded.
2852 2018-11-14 19:19:23 It calms me down. You have to figure out what dose works for you. Helps some with pain too. I got these CBD gummies and was very sceptical until I noticed how much they helped me sleep. Have not figured out the oil yet. Good luck! It takes a while to kick in,so give it time. #CBD
2853 2018-11-14 19:19:18 Get some magnesium and rosemary essential oil STAT!
2854 2018-11-14 19:19:15 @moremegastores  It happened thrice for me that price written on more price tag is not matching with price they have in there system. Like for parasuit hare oil, it was written 135 but on billing they charged 160. So be careful while billing and if possible try to avoid.
2855 2018-11-14 19:19:14 Oil goes up, talking heads find talking heads to talk @ oil going .
Oil goes down, talking heads find talking heads to talk @ oil going .
Can oil get to 100? Absolutely, for reasons then being said.
Can oil go to 40? Absolutely, for reasons now being said.
Probability?

2866 2018-11-14 19:18:24 Gee Alex...   How about the point that the oil companies are actually subsidizing the US government more so than the other way around.  The US government makes 5 times the profit per gallon that the oil companies make.  That would be the first point.

2872 2018-11-14 19:17:52 Wind, Solar and Wave energy creation uses significantly less oil than the majority of current methods.

They are also superior sources of energy because of the smaller environmental impact, increased cost effectiveness and massive improvement to safety.
2873 2018-11-14 19:17:51 Saudi oil goes to one refinery in Canada, Irving Oil. The federal government could mandate that Saudi oil not be allowed to be purchased by refiners in Canada. Irving would have to replace it. Energy East would have replaced it. Feds made that impossible with stupid regulations.
2874 2018-11-14 19:17:32 haaay.. Excess oil sa akOng nawOng! pastilan! ugh! 
2875 2018-11-14 19:17:29 @JulieASmith01 mentioned something about changing your oil for you
2876 2018-11-14 19:17:23 Why does your group say nothing of the unethical oil coming into Canada?  What country do you support?
2877 2018-11-14 19:17:11 If u really love me , buy me some oil for my wax pen
2878 2018-11-14 19:17:02 It's 2 pm and 31 degrees in CT. I ran out of oil overnight so it's been cold inside and out. Just got a delivery and the furnace is up and running.
2879 2018-11-14 19:16:53 I've never had it this bad in my life. So that's been an experience. I'm trying to dry-brush my scanty beard and see if that'll help. I don't know if beard oil will make me break out more or not, so I've been avoiding it for the time being.
2880 2018-11-14 19:16:48 dnt reduce nw,u young u need food to build muscle,reduce oil food.dnt eat fry items alot.later whn 21 above u start,thn ok.i help u,dnt wrry.
2881 2018-11-14 19:16:44 Yes around pg school
2882 2018-11-14 19:16:34 In Canada, seems like it's because we can't get our oil out of the country and we can't use it as well. We're banned to buy it elsewhere in usd. And usdcad is quite high. We're screwed
2883 2018-11-14 19:16:27 depressing take is that abundant and underused oil supplies will make its continued use competitive with nuclear and renewables for longer
2884 2018-11-14 19:16:14 If you fail will a new GM & coach be far off.  Is Talbot a backup? Will anyone score other that McDavid/Draisaitl (works for Boston and Colorado)?  Will the Oil make the playoffs? Hmmm.

2909 2018-11-14 19:14:12 Bush didn't sell his oil and gas to be President and neither did any other President. Any gift must be reported to the government. Like that pure gold necklace given to Obama by Saudi. Each President or member family might receive a gift from foreign dignitaries

2919 2018-11-14 19:13:01 It better be plastic and palm oil free
2920 2018-11-14 19:13:00 Hey @MDLZ, how about not adding palm oil from Wilmar, which is killing Orangutans through deforestation, to your Oreos? Until you do, I'll no longer be buying Triscuits, Ritz or Philadelphia Cream Cheese, and any othe product you make. @Greenpeace #PalmOilFree
2921 2018-11-14 19:12:53 Let me save you some time: No, I don't know when this market wide decimation will end. Probably not until oil starts going back up, we make some headway with China, and/or Powell indicates he's going to slow down in 2 weeks. One would hope he'd give the market relief....

2926 2018-11-14 19:12:32 Yikes! It's good you are avoiding palm oil, but animal agriculture destroys far more rainforest than palm oil.  They grow grain to feed animals.....it's good that this advert is alerting people to our rainforests and habitat loss though.

2934 2018-11-14 19:12:06 How are you defining Gen X? Because the only major economic stress I associate with Gen X is the oil embargo, and of course Reagan was able to redirect that anxiety into trickle down. Which is neoliberal late capitalism.

And now most people can see that that's broken.
2935 2018-11-14 19:11:59 Suppose they just put American weapons up for sale and switch to buying from the Russians? Unless some agreement prevents it, would seem logical course of action.

2937 2018-11-14 19:11:40 Crude oil- Creating the panic among the long holders. Next leg f rally  wl be very sharp. & it wl cross 100$.
2938 2018-11-14 19:11:39 we should have these walls covered in oil so they can not climb it
2939 2018-11-14 19:11:36 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2940 2018-11-14 19:11:31 Oh cut it out. Nobody, including @noem210 , said they think Pelosi is the enemy "of eliminating Big Oil influence in politicians". That assumption is yours alone.

2945 2018-11-14 19:10:48 It tend to like either grilling or using the crock pot, but roasting is also a good method for cooking a bunch of meat at once.

My tastes are fairly bland but I basically believe that olive oil + salt + pepper + garlic on anything makes it edible.

2951 2018-11-14 19:10:13 i thought about it but the pharmacist at cvs used to tell me about how bad orajel really is  i got some clove oil on break just now tho
2952 2018-11-14 19:10:09 Interesting. Also interesting that you have oil companies supporting a tax on carbon but a narrative that this is destroying things. Interesting. Times.
2953 2018-11-14 19:10:09 It’s an oil that’s used in loads of products. Comes from Africa or Brazil or wherever but forests are being destroyed to make way for more palm oil farms 
2954 2018-11-14 19:10:03 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2955 2018-11-14 19:09:55 My thought exactly.
2956 2018-11-14 19:09:54 “The principle of protesting politicians that take oil money is bad when it happens to my party”
2957 2018-11-14 19:09:49 I think it would have to be some kinda raise to consider it. Like not only the time it's taking from you, but also the millage/wear and tear on your vehicle that they're not compensating you for. More gas, more oil changes, faster tire wear, etc.
2958 2018-11-14 19:09:37 "The fact that he's a serial killer isn't as scary as his incompetence."
"The pilot *wants* to crash the plane, but what should really scare us is how bad he is at flying."
"I'm not worried that the carjackers stole my car. I'm worried they won't change the oil every 3K miles."

2969 2018-11-14 19:08:32 I’m becoming more convinced that the end game (by design) is 2 bankrupt oil cies, & move the resource assets under State ctrl, at which point all regulatory gridlock will suddenly disappear, & the revenues will start to flow again (but not 2 us, but the govt & it’s UN overlords)
2970 2018-11-14 19:08:18 Maybe he is long bitcoin? Oil?

2972 2018-11-14 19:08:15 $CPG making bank on hedges; 
USD CL swaps below ~55USD.
CAD Swaps below ~58USD
CAD 3W collars below ~60USD (floor ~48.00). 
These add to revenues, and reduces un-realized losses. 
BUT, lower realized sales! Because un-hedged bbls get hit.
~48% oil production hedged.
Just sayin'
2973 2018-11-14 19:07:59 1. First I remove my makeup using baby oil. It’s not for everyone but I’ve been using it for years & it makes my skin feel so clean & smooth.

2975 2018-11-14 19:07:56 Nobodies saying we shouldn't move away from oil and gas but at the moment we don't have an alternative in play. Therefor all we'll end up doing is buying oil and coal from countries with a far worse environmental record than our own.

3000 2018-11-14 19:04:39 Fish oil supplements often contain undeclared ingredients or are contaminated, as they are not govt inspected like other food. No pregnant woman should take them —for safety reasons —regardless of whether they “work”.

3010 2018-11-14 19:04:09 peep aboveeveryone’s skin is different but the golden rule is stay moisturized and exfoliating is powerful! some good cleansing/healing oils I know of are tea tree, almond, castor, jojoba, avocado, rosehip and turmeric (not an oil tho lol)
3011 2018-11-14 19:03:50 I usually smoke it. CBD oil doesn’t do it for me. Something in the THC always works for my pain. Also helps me eat when I am unable! Hope you feel better :)

3021 2018-11-14 19:02:49 Not particularly, it's synthetic (the furniture oil is) unlike Osmo, so it's really hard wearing against natural oil - ie fingerprints etc. I've had a couple of bad experiences with Osmo so I'm not a big fan. I just really like the Holzol finish.

3023 2018-11-14 19:02:43 They had drained the oil from the engine but by the time we got outside the engineers had gone for lunch so didn’t get to ask them what they were doing :(
3024 2018-11-14 19:02:38 This kind of tiredness tho. That's how I almost "sprinkled" oil on my sauce. Smh. I should just go and sleep.
3025 2018-11-14 19:02:32 Whenever we talk about the subsidies to Big Oil, we should count every penny spent on armed forces and wars specifically protecting its interests. The bill runs into many, many trillions-and alas, even proponents of renewables often overlook the fact.
3026 2018-11-14 19:02:31 Do you have to smoke it or just eat it? Or is CBD oil the same? Or am I way off! haha, sorry about your IBS, i can imagine the pain :(

3060 2018-11-14 18:59:07 Try Sainsbury’s Greek style instead of feta - cook pasta, I use Sainsbury’s fusilli made from rice, maize & quinoa, stir in the ‘cheese’, black olives & garlic infused extra virgin olive oil.

3062 2018-11-14 18:59:00 It was simply a choice, and Alberta let the big oil companies make billions and will leave us with the mess.  They could have kept high levels of royalties, regardless of the myth of market access prices.

3064 2018-11-14 18:58:44 I moisturize w/emu & CBD oil by Theramu! Emu oil is transdermal, so isn't just treating superficial layers of skin. I also m & wash w/ Cheryl Lee MD, which creates skin barrier & was designed for ppl w/ eczema. Both hypoallergenic. Happy birthday!
3065 2018-11-14 18:58:42 Mercedes has put emblems on their cars that light up at night and that is pretty cool. You know what else is cool? Not having to spend $200 for an oil change
3066 2018-11-14 18:58:26 And uses palm oil...
3067 2018-11-14 18:58:22 Two things:
- @DrBronner peppermint soap
- @PinknessCo flawless beauty oil
3068 2018-11-14 18:58:17 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
3069 2018-11-14 18:58:16 I’m finally cracking down properly on my palm oil usage and just went on my break for work and wanted loads of chocolate and the ones I wanted ALL had palm oil in them:((((( so sad but palm oil needs to be reduced!!!!!!
3070 2018-11-14 18:58:10 ได้ดิ55555
3071 2018-11-14 18:58:09 Could someone create an app so we could check if products contain palm oil? @IcelandFoods @PalmOilProject @AppStore @Greenpeace
3072 2018-11-14 18:58:06 Maybe try to use other forms of it. Like I cut down to only using my oil pen and only when I feel the anxiety creeping in. I do like two pulls and I’m good. Cause yeah after a while the lows are verrrry low if u smoke a lot
3073 2018-11-14 18:57:59 I ran out of coconut oil for my hair, yeah brb
3074 2018-11-14 18:57:54 Thanks for explanation will definitely  do more research on dirty palm oil and boycott those products
3075 2018-11-14 18:57:52 The bad news is that I ordered 1500 litres of heating oil three weeks ago. At the price of three weeks ago. 
3076 2018-11-14 18:57:16 Get a glug of olive or rapeseed oil 
3077 2018-11-14 18:57:16 Scottish oil is looking like a mighty fine bargaining tool right now Frankie!
3078 2018-11-14 18:57:14 What is oil down?
3079 2018-11-14 18:57:06 :D oh boy!
3080 2018-11-14 18:57:05 Then why does the radical left continue to support buying as much oil from Saudi Arabia as possible?
3081 2018-11-14 18:57:03 It’s cars in Europe that get 60mpg even 80mpg. Of course the U.S. won’t allow those cars in America because they will crash the oil market.
3082 2018-11-14 18:56:57 Tea tree oil is the cure for everything
3083 2018-11-14 18:56:56 She's a shill for the oil & gas industry. One of many. On par with those working for the NRA, and well-known in the struggle to get people to reject the science around tobacco and cancer.
3084 2018-11-14 18:56:52 Christian Cole's official final rushing total this season is 3,252 yards for Oil City. We might not see a season like that in District 10 ever again, at least not for a long time. Congrats to Christian! @OilersFB
3085 2018-11-14 18:56:50 Hey Amy!  Yes you can find me on almost of the social media's. I have been teaching other's the importance of taking CBD oil and how to find the purest on the market. 
3086 2018-11-14 18:56:47 Doctor Phoenix’s owners are hoping their fairytale can continue in Thursday’s Clonmel Oil Chase.
3087 2018-11-14 18:56:44 #shopping  Sorry, I think this spray-on cooking oil is a load of bollards. And expensive bollards at that. Plus the nozzle always blocks while the can's only half used.
3088 2018-11-14 18:56:41 May be doing so. It doesn't look very legit. Like I said when mine was terribly delayed coming through Chicago & it apparently was involved in some other shipping problem (package looked like they dumped oil all over it) I got the same bag as @mrkdub w/ the apology letter on bag
3089 2018-11-14 18:56:32 You said that oil makes you groggy in the morning! I struggle to drag myself out of bed atm as it is
3090 2018-11-14 18:56:14 I'll keep saying it. Hold back our equalization payments until the other provinces notice and speak up. We can't always be a give and give province. No progress means no payments. If the east buys Saudi oil they should get zero dollars. #cdnpoli
3091 2018-11-14 18:56:11 I just paid $72 for an oil change...my heart is broken. I could’ve bought so many chicken tenders with that $
3092 2018-11-14 18:56:07 It won't pass thankfully, but if it did why encourage more children to run the gauntlet of cartels, child molestors, rapists and child slave traders? Most of the children " lost" by DHS were placed with these exact illegal aliens
3093 2018-11-14 18:56:04 เเล้วชั้นเลือกอะไรได้ไหมเลือกไม่ไปได้รึเปล่า
3094 2018-11-14 18:56:02 After attending #ADIPEC2018
I have doubts that oil will ever end ! At least not anytime soon.
3095 2018-11-14 18:55:45 Dont forget that oil hit the oil equity complexes hard too and we are seeing that flow through today on $SPX and $DJIA
3096 2018-11-14 18:55:34 Rising oil prices is leading recession signal, we were told in the summer. Now oil going down also means recession?
3097 2018-11-14 18:55:22 Plastic cheese, one molecule away from being able to lubricate your car engine.  Good ol’ oil byproducts!
3098 2018-11-14 18:55:19 I started lessening to Rush Limbaugh during the primaries of the 2016. I was hoping I could understand a different view point or have my ideas changed. Today he’s arguing that oil isn’t a fossil fuel and is being constantly replenished in the earth. I’ve wasted allot of time.
3099 2018-11-14 18:55:08 1. First I remove my makeup using baby oil. It’s not for everyone but I’ve been using it for years and it makes my skin feel so clean & smooth. 
2. I then cleanse my face with ‘Retinol Tonic’ by PIXI. This helps rejuvenate skin for a natural glow. 
3100 2018-11-14 18:55:04 What do you think Tony Blair would prefer 

1 a second vote on something that has already been democratically decided?
 or 
2 an opportunity to kill hundreds of thousands more people for oil?
3101 2018-11-14 18:54:58 I hate being stuck behind girls who have no idea what oil goes in their car 
3102 2018-11-14 18:54:56 Popped to the shop and fancied a chocolate bar. @CadburyUK Twirl? Double decker? @Oreo bar? Ended up not bothering, as they all contain palm oil #BanPalmOil #SavetheOrangutan
3103 2018-11-14 18:54:48 It doesn’t hurt... but it’s unnecessary. Just like changing your oil at 3k miles is hogwash.
3104 2018-11-14 18:54:39 Most of what Canada has left in the ground is just bitumen.  Irving has repeatedly said it prefers to use oil and is not willing to invest the $6+B it would take to upgrade its refinery to deal with lower quality feed.
3105 2018-11-14 18:54:38 You’ve invaded all but 20 countries for oil and gold and land do u really think nobody died in the process? A quick google search will tell you plenty of the war crimes committed by Britain but I doubt you’ll look bc you know what you’ll find won’t fit your glorified war agenda.
3106 2018-11-14 18:54:35 Thanks to booming production, the  can damage our ecosystem and abuse Native Americans rights for another 5 years to supply oil for the .
3107 2018-11-14 18:54:32 Why is getting an oil change such a task
3108 2018-11-14 18:54:31 she’s wisein the mornings I rinse with warm water and massage jojoba oil into my face (earths toner). at nite I’ll use castor oil soap, exfoliate and apply another oil to moisturize. it’s a fluid routine though, it’s winter rn so I just try to respond to what my body needs lol
3109 2018-11-14 18:54:31 Given that we just rejected decreasing the gas tax passed by #CAleg, I'm going with "they're gone." Also, if hypothetical federal tax raise is in conjunction with killing oil subsidies and using that revenue to incentive/subsidize EV purchases, you could keep them more broadly
3110 2018-11-14 18:54:30 Guess who’s back and has left dr bronners hair oil based Christianity and has been FULLY embraced in the sudsy arms of Big Shamp neo atheism also I LOOOOOOVE being lewd from now on it’s dry dry full frontal all the time
3111 2018-11-14 18:54:27 Alhaji of block A common room in my mind 
3112 2018-11-14 18:54:24  inetu koma I told you my clear skin routine. You still sleeping on tissue oil huh
3113 2018-11-14 18:54:23 So true,  but facts in SA leaders is water and oil.  Ngamaxoki straight
3114 2018-11-14 18:54:20 In Revelation 6, as the 3rd horseman comes, the price of wheat goes up, but the oil and the wine temain untouched.
3115 2018-11-14 18:54:19 I’d at least ask if they have gas money +$10 towards my next oil change and if they agreed I’d just refer them to Uber  same difference right ?
3116 2018-11-14 18:54:15 “kush to kush, oil to oil” -iz
3117 2018-11-14 18:54:15 [Neo doesn’t seem bothered. He orders the milk and some motor oil for himself. They are promptly put on the table.]
3118 2018-11-14 18:54:04 I think between GE and now oil credit is now driving the market.  Equities are likely just along for the ride for awhile.....
3119 2018-11-14 18:54:02 What say you @jamespeshaw  Game is up. Climate change narrative a big con, a globalist Marxist socialist scam that you are trying to foist upon NZ. Banning oil /gas exploration a sinister driver of that. @nzherald @JudithCollinsMP @simonjbridges
3120 2018-11-14 18:53:57 Kinds of stains from everything...I use it in kitchen too as a degreaser.   I will ask husband the name of it.  He uses it for car grease and oil remover....really great stuff.
3121 2018-11-14 18:53:57 Waiting to get an oil change and this lady is really chewing her gum with her mouth wide open making that awful smacking noise while also aggressively filing her nails... Get me outta here
3122 2018-11-14 18:53:56 Multiple JEDCO projects mentioned in the 2018 #StateofJefferson: Avondale Shipyard acquisition, Fuji Oil processing facility, @USFoods expansion, @OchsnerHealth expansion, the redevelopment of #Elmwood Shopping Center & our Facade Improvement Program to stimulate growth.
3123 2018-11-14 18:53:52 Sorry, Jeff - I put my reply about Amazon under this tweet instead of another spot. Yes, I agree.  The wealthy in CA enjoy the tax breaks, of course.  The American way has always been the mid-working poor people paying for their lifestyles, including fighting in oil wars.
3124 2018-11-14 18:53:50 My Italian-American mother can't stand olive oil.

I like all the Italian foods and most of the Jewish foods (even the much-maligned gefilte fish), but my parents met as Peace Corps volunteers in Nigeria, and I can't stand okra.
3125 2018-11-14 18:53:48 @dairycrest love your vitalite dairy free spread but how about reducing the amount of palm oil you use in it.#PalmOilFree
3126 2018-11-14 18:53:42 i’m stuck at walmart getting my oil changed what should i do
3127 2018-11-14 18:53:34 went in to get a oil change and got my breaks done too 
3128 2018-11-14 18:53:31 3. Once a week I’ll use ‘Rose Flash Balm’ by PIXI. I use it as a face mask. I leave it on for 15 minutes. It moisturises and brightens skin. 
4. Lastly I apply my ‘Rose Oil Blend’ by PIXI. It’s a nourishing facial oil and adds so much luminosity! I’m so in love! 
3129 2018-11-14 18:53:31 Natty all weather that spiked it up - Trumps Tweet to OPEC did the damage on Oil - plenty made a killing too :) - the Reuters reporters are fed rumors etc and always look for the bad = was pretty clear Trump + Cold - different beasts
3130 2018-11-14 18:53:31 I was sooo happy my gas is lasting more than a week but now I have to use my gas money for an oil change 
3131 2018-11-14 18:53:23 Strange things going on in Israel. Bibi says there were "secret considerations" re ceasefire.

And what's w Oil?

Saudis?

Like the Caravan, not much in the news

3133 2018-11-14 18:53:22 Malaysia came to learn about palm oil from Nigeria and now they are better at it.
3134 2018-11-14 18:53:06 Oil panting ke tu
3135 2018-11-14 18:53:02 sear both sides..in light oil or butter and spices then slow bake in oven

= PERFECTION
3136 2018-11-14 18:53:00 TIL what an Amish oil change is. Good stuff.
3137 2018-11-14 18:52:58 Proud to be part of males occupying Sulaiman Hall now and before. Thank you
3138 2018-11-14 18:52:42 Their fair share. Take avg yr income in US & everybody pays 25% on $ over avg. No deductions, write offs, amortization, or oil lease crap & a simple 1 pg form to file. If avg = $50,000 & you made $300,000, tax would be $62,500, state + fed. You get health & college care free.
3139 2018-11-14 18:52:30 or an oil spill with more drilling
3140 2018-11-14 18:51:56 @MollySmithNews great segment you did. I'm looking for short-term oil bounce on daily chart(extremevalue bar under 10, 0.8 boll bands,2momentum arrows, weekly reverse levels, etc.). Swing low is near, my opinion. No advice, Trevor Smith, newsletter  CTA
3141 2018-11-14 18:51:55 Lemme guess I smell like beer, cigar and oil.
3142 2018-11-14 18:51:49 maiweeee nemadhuriro akuita DL kana Olive oil.... 28,99$. a lot of ladies have resorted to hupostori....zvaakungonzi kwapisa ndimbofurwa nemhepo naiwo maladies cut aya
3143 2018-11-14 18:51:44 Please list all foods and products that have palm oil in them, so we the end user can try and boycott them.
3144 2018-11-14 18:51:41 Caroline Rose Hunt, Texas oil heiress, philanthropist, dies -- news at 1:00.
3145 2018-11-14 18:51:39 Bring back the North Sea Oil and Gas I say ;)))
3146 2018-11-14 18:51:32 Also in case you have failed to notice, while we had our heads up our asses denying climate change the world has demanded change. I doubt they will go for our oil unless there is more greenwashing. So C tax will stay even if the Kenney dumps it. Feds will impose. All BS by Kenney
3147 2018-11-14 18:51:24 You don’t fight for Britain or @theresa_may . You fight for your family on the front line. 
Only fools or adventurers would join today for the oil wars or EU army to suppress populace. 
Be a Bankster, jail free fraud, what’s not to like.
3148 2018-11-14 18:51:23 The media you mentioned is fact based? You're drinking the Kool Aid.  Well I'd love to exchange insults with you, but I've got guns to oil, my Bible to read, you know conservative stuff. All the best.
3149 2018-11-14 18:51:22 If you think about it this oil pricing issue, is like us with our (technically their diamonds) DeBeers stockpiles worldwide diamond supplies in London and Antwerp to drive the prices higher. Those Saudi's are doing exactly the same with their oil.
3150 2018-11-14 18:51:16 Just checkin the oil... no big deal...
3151 2018-11-14 18:51:06 Time traveling body oil infused with wild mint, jade, and anxiety for harmony and love.
3152 2018-11-14 18:51:01 Wow s/o to my brother for my washing my car and doing an oil change 
3153 2018-11-14 18:51:00 Yeah. But the city could also use some major upgrades which this would cause. The city is still recovering from the oil slump.
3154 2018-11-14 18:50:51 เหลือก็แค่คืนอ่ะยากอะไร ส่วนใช้จ่ายอะไรบ้างก็อีกเรื่องบิลก็มีหนิเนอะ
3155 2018-11-14 18:50:51 You peel one edge back carefully and work the baby oil under it as you go.
3156 2018-11-14 18:50:39 When these companies sell their oil in Canada at low prices, they get to report less revenue here, and so pay less tax in Canada.  They take that oil to the USA, refine it, and report more profit in USA.  The 'benefit' of foreign investment.
3157 2018-11-14 18:50:37 Why would the USA work with us? They are getting our oil cheap. They want it cheap. They have a fracking boom. They have all the oil they need. Nope. The USA won't work with us. We need to have new markets. This is what @JustinTrudeau is working on. So we got a pipeline.
3158 2018-11-14 18:50:35 Perhaps if Irving had Canadian options, they wouldn't have to purchase Saudi or American oil.
3159 2018-11-14 18:50:30 skin sama lah. kalau combi and dull i pakai simple oil balancing or rosken sensitive skin. itu for day routine. for night routine i pakai The Ordinary azelaic acid for scars. scars takkan hilang tapi dia akan pudar. azelaic acid is for dull also sebab dia effect brightens 
3160 2018-11-14 18:50:23 These oil down comments are hilarious!! 
3161 2018-11-14 18:50:08 not even cointainer, am talking a ship full load of oil
3162 2018-11-14 18:50:04 My anatomy teacher just talked about the extremes people do to pass a drug test and all I picture right now is the BMS episode where they do the oil changes 
3163 2018-11-14 18:50:02 For an oil I used Doo Gro in the yellow bottle and for every week that I didn't deep condition I did a hot oil treatment. I also took biotin pills for hair growth. Every 3 months I would also do a protein treatment to stop breakage by APhogee. Good Luck Curly Girlies!
3164 2018-11-14 18:49:58 @StuartLynde are you following the Enbridge and Mackinac Bridge story? We need help saving our freshwater in the Straits of Mackinac from this Canadian oil company.
3165 2018-11-14 18:49:57 protective hairstyles (make sure to not get tight braids / cornrows), oil ur hair day n night (mix jamaican castor oil into ur grease), treatments when u wash ur hair +++ i can dm u some more tips if u want 
3166 2018-11-14 18:49:42 obsessed with Shea moisture Castor Oil collection + the Omega 3,6,9 oil  my hair is sooooo soft.
3167 2018-11-14 18:49:39 ...and fear not the hot peppers! You can get those and skip the oil.
3168 2018-11-14 18:49:34 Hmm, when is oil running out, again??  Global warming??  Is someone lying??
3169 2018-11-14 18:49:33 Stop importing foreign oil.
3170 2018-11-14 18:49:30 Lizzo has an album called Coconut Oil and it’s soooo good 
3171 2018-11-14 18:49:28 this city is *already* on the right track. when nenshi took over, we were number 11. now we're fourth.

this was achieved, *despite* the oil downturn, by steady, incremental, community-driven improvements.
3172 2018-11-14 18:49:25 And completely missed an unbelievable opportunity. Lacking of vision from #YYC now means 
1)Taxes still going to go up
2)Snow removal will still be shitty, just higher taxes 
3) Downtown is still empty 
4) The price of oil is still embarrassingly low 
5) Still no alternative plan
3173 2018-11-14 18:49:20 How long ago was that? 3yrs, 4yrs, 5yrs? Economics and value of  money change with time. So, an akara business 10yrs ago is not the same as today. While growing up a ball of akara was 5kobo so a N5 akara is a lot and how much was a bag of beans a garawa of oil then
3174 2018-11-14 18:49:20 #GlobalWarming I remember President Jimmy Carter telling Us to “ Turn Down the Thermostat & Put On A Sweater “ Because the World is running out of oil ? But Yet ? The Market Is Overrun With Oil , an I’m almost 60 ?
3175 2018-11-14 18:49:13 Huh, interesting. I consider Hazelnut praline an equivalent to chocolate crack. Guess everyone doesn't have the taste buds for that. Then again, Nutella brand does a shitty job making them. Palm oil does that.
3176 2018-11-14 18:49:06 Fin energy contracts like WTI/Brent have specific product descriptions that force sellers to deliver that specific good quality oil at their maturities. Because new discoveries are mostly heavy oil, these contracts will always be in a secular bull markets with interim selloffs(2)
3177 2018-11-14 18:49:04 We get oil imports mainly from USA (about half).  We also get it from the Saudis, Algeria, Nigeria, UAE.  However, the mix is always changing with markets conditions.
3178 2018-11-14 18:49:03 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
3179 2018-11-14 18:48:55 Performance Plus Motor Oil was it for me. Reason reminds me of good old days when Matt & the "killer bees" were in top form...
3180 2018-11-14 18:48:55 So grateful you & your family are safe. And thank you for donating! Please add @citizensclimate lobby to the above list of organizations.  100,000+ CCL volunteers  working with Congress for a #PriceOnCarbon. Climate Change is increasing wildfires.  Not one more life for Oil.
3181 2018-11-14 18:48:51 Who'd you rather? 1). #potstocks 2). #bitcoin 3). #oil...and no poking your eyes out to achieve the same effect is not an option.
3182 2018-11-14 18:48:37 What’s this “money we give you”, and, “15bn extra we pump into Scotland” bullshit.  The Uk is kept afloat by Scotland’s wealth, especially her oil and the sooner ye get that thru your thick heid the better 
3183 2018-11-14 18:48:37 بعد شهر من استخدام الcoconut oil فللامانه very recommended فرق كلش چبير بشعري التساقط قل كلش وطبيعته صارت كلش حلوه والريحه تخببل
3184 2018-11-14 18:48:33 Gottah get an oil change
3185 2018-11-14 18:48:32 Gliding nursing chair. 
Has been well loved and is in need of some TLC. Screws need tightening and mechanisms need an oil. We have just never got round to doing any of it. 
Cushions can be washed, from smoke free home.
3186 2018-11-14 18:48:30 One time I got tea tree oil facewash in my eyes before class and I thought I was actually going to be blind for the rest of my life so I didn’t go to class
3187 2018-11-14 18:48:21 All hail tea tree oil
3188 2018-11-14 18:48:20 @CadburyUK not buying cadburys anymore till you stop using palm oil #SavetheOrangutan #PalmOilFree #cadburys #Nestle
3189 2018-11-14 18:48:18 Yeah very true. Palm oil is a big issue of course but the meat industry is a waaaay bigger issue. People always want the easy option as opposed to addressing the real problem.
3190 2018-11-14 18:47:59 Why do we need to have the government to impose cuts to oil production. Why don't the companies just reduce production?
3191 2018-11-14 18:47:56 The other hostels and the hostel newly built
3192 2018-11-14 18:47:52 Baby oil.
3193 2018-11-14 18:47:43 You have a very short memory. If Scotland had voted for independence it would have pretty much immediately gone bust based on the economic model of oil revenue when the price fell 100 dollars to 50 dollars. Be thankful your part of the UK and benefit from being in the union
3194 2018-11-14 18:47:42 Hi, thanks for the reply and thanks for the information. I didn’t notice anywhere in the policy anything about the protection of the animals that are losing there homes and habitat on an huge scale due to the farming of palm oil, how do you combat that? Why use palm oil at all?
3195 2018-11-14 18:47:42 Cutting back on oil...that is what they should be doing. Raising prices will help their country survive the change from fossil fuel needed to protect the planet from global warming. Smart - even if I hate the price tag at the gas station.
3196 2018-11-14 18:47:40 Norway taxes their Oil Companies 70% of profits.They have excellent health care for all their people,free tuition for college or trade school,and good pension plans.The People themselves,Are the National Engine, That should be well cared for,they do the work and pay the bills.

Mohammad Badaru for sending me N100.000 & Dutse council chairman for the gift of N15.000 & two bags of rice,one carton of Spaghetti,& a gallon of cooking oil,”-What they gave the father of the guy who was electrocuted hoisting Gov & PMB's flag
3199 2018-11-14 18:47:21 Chef Skinner cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with Silly Putty.

Know your real friends.
3201 2018-11-14 18:47:17 You can dismiss the environmentalists, their tactics and efficacy. And I will certainly dismiss a shill for the oil and gas industry. But neither one of us can dismiss what the experts, scientists and scientific organizations around the world are telling us about climate change.
3202 2018-11-14 18:47:13 I'll have to crack the code for making cookies with toasted hazelnut or pecan oil, to get that same kind of nutty richness!
3203 2018-11-14 18:47:07 Greenspan "beginning to see the first signs of inflation"- cool, just as oil tanking- good work, Alan...

3205 2018-11-14 18:46:57 As I just said on @Lowetide's radio show, it's pretty non-controversial for a team to use the goalie who is playing better. 2 veterans playing for 1 contract extension is my take. Competition is good, but you have to respect unexpected outcomes are possible.
3206 2018-11-14 18:46:56 auntie ronny n trell stayed with the oil
3207 2018-11-14 18:46:52 #USAYouGetWhatYouAskedFor All the continuous shit that #DonaldTrump does I think can be simply explained with him holding his side of a deal and creating havoc doing so. #EPA is in the hands of the oil/coal lobby; Moving Israeli embassy to Jerusalem; Abortion rights; Immigration
3208 2018-11-14 18:46:49 Saudi oil is good quality stuff and readily delivered to the private sector firms (mainly Irving Oil) that buy it.  Sourcing is not a government decision.

3211 2018-11-14 18:46:37 WW1, not sure. WW2 spot on. They won the war for us. But it was USSR. Thing is, when Russia agrees to abandon all its satellites, becomes more capitalistic than France and more deomocratic than Italy we decide that we should “push it back everywhere” because it closed oil taps
3212 2018-11-14 18:46:31 1. First I removemy makeup using baby oil. It’s not for everyone but I’ve been doing it for years and it makes my skin feel so clean & smooth. 
2. I then cleanse my face with ‘Retinol Tonic’ by PIXI. This helps rejuvenate skin for a natural glow. 
3213 2018-11-14 18:46:31 Or is, there's no one saying anything intelligent being about oil right now.
3214 2018-11-14 18:46:27 Oh yeah. Tyrick Terry is the winner of the 3 commissions. God speed, my dude. Big ups for the support.

3219 2018-11-14 18:46:07 In JA.. nah.. In JA - is like oil and water
3220 2018-11-14 18:46:03 You forgot to add palm oil. Who will now drink the oil when it remains?
3221 2018-11-14 18:45:59 As fluctuating as the oil prices....
3222 2018-11-14 18:45:54 I don’t know why you guys are complaining? A few weeks ago in Alberta we were filling up over 1.20
The very same oil that comes out of Alberta then gets sold back to us at an inflated price.
3223 2018-11-14 18:45:33 Just saved my little sister from using coconut oil on her face. Gave her sources from @LaBeautyologist, so you saved yet another face, Nai 
3224 2018-11-14 18:45:31 Agreed. Also, only one of the two is playing for a contract in Edmonton. Said it early last year and stand by it, zero chance of Talbot signing a term deal with Oilers. Koskinen has that shot, which is why he signed here.
3225 2018-11-14 18:45:26 But United and Liverpool earned their success through the perseverance and hardwork of their managers, in particular Busby, Fergie, Shankly and Paisley....it wasn’t bought overnight with oil money. Compare yourselves to JW’s Blackburn and Abromovic’s Chelsea #lotterywinners

3228 2018-11-14 18:45:12 Kenya has accumulated just 15 per cent of the targeted volumes of crude oil needed to start exports under the early oil pilot scheme.
3229 2018-11-14 18:45:02 All jumping on the Palm Oil wagon, if only Iceland would do an advert on the environmental impact of the meat they are selling
3230 2018-11-14 18:45:01 still try em with olive oil tad of balsamic delicious
3231 2018-11-14 18:44:59 That was from Friday’s Telegraph. So why are Oil companies spending millions still exploring & drilling for oil?
3232 2018-11-14 18:44:58 I'm surprised the resulting oil slick didn't ooze you both out of the room. Although I'm not surprised you're friends. Heaven knows you both were never the friends of the poor, middle class, POC, women, wage earner demographics of your respective constituencies.
3233 2018-11-14 18:44:44 Oil is a very precious commodity. Most of the oil they discover these days is heavy oil, meaning it is relatively expensive to process it in refineries to turn into light and mid distillates. (1)

3238 2018-11-14 18:44:19 Been meaning to go back to oil pastels too. I wonder if anyone has drawn a comic in oil pastels before? I liked that medium.
3239 2018-11-14 18:44:17 Good! It's called reality! No country and no company is that insane to give up US market for a broke tiny Iran market! Oil prices are massively going down. World market won't miss IR oil!
3240 2018-11-14 18:44:13 I don't, either. I can't stand the taste of it, or the high. I need to use the medical mj to help me sleep at times & in oil form it tastes even more gross 
3241 2018-11-14 18:44:03 Make a friend sit with you for an hour and go over your presentation enough times that you know exactly what you’re going to say. And CBD oil. And just breathe and when you hear that you’re talking to fast just take a sec to collect your thoughts
3242 2018-11-14 18:43:59 What are you talking about you fucking munter if it wasn't for scotland and our oil and gas it is England that would be bankrupt .the oil gave financial services, nukes, army navy England has nothing to give scotland. In fact if it wasn't for you leeches we would be 1 of richest
3243 2018-11-14 18:43:59 Earth it’s a very unstable planet due to its liquid core . Pumping out oil contributes to more instability . Humanity doesn’t even realize how unstable and dangerous earth is .
3244 2018-11-14 18:43:46 Hey @LushLtd - are you using palm oil in your products and, if so, is it from a sustainable source. This will be a deal breaker for me before I start my Xmas shopping

3246 2018-11-14 18:43:43 I was wondering when we would start giving out names of Palm oil users, but then the list would probably be endless huh!
3247 2018-11-14 18:43:36 No , shortage of oil will come to light too, just morons that hedged $wti against. Squessed out yesterday

3252 2018-11-14 18:43:17 So many still under the hypnosis of a snake oil salesmen. All Trump has to say is “fake news” and they believe what he says.
3253 2018-11-14 18:43:14 We need an International orangutan logo which is on palm oil free products. We already have the PETA, cruelty free logo, bee friendly, vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free, fair trade... soo many people are unaware of where ingredients come from, not just palm oil.
3254 2018-11-14 18:43:08 Again,  bollocks in that.. it's  regarded that lot of the oil  not  developed or found yet would be too  expensive to extract.
3255 2018-11-14 18:43:03 Eating meat is one of many widely popular bad ideas for a list of reasons. My diet is a bag of plant protein, bottle of oil, and stack of vitamin pills. No refrigeration needed. Not likely to be popular any time soon.
3256 2018-11-14 18:42:41 Sitting here for this oil change hungry af. Found a snickers in my purse. I love me
3257 2018-11-14 18:42:37 It was nothing you, Greg, or you, Raphael, did.  It was all due to the resurgence of oil.  Period.

3266 2018-11-14 18:42:01 Olive oil. Just enough to lightly grease the pan. The fat on these are so high they don’t need much extra fat to cook in

3268 2018-11-14 18:41:49 For @ParklandInst conference attendees: please note that Kevin Taft, author of Oil's Deep State, will be replacing Gillian Steward in the History session on Saturday morning.
3269 2018-11-14 18:41:46 "rising oil prices" -> Briefly maybe but they have been decreasing rapidly for the past few weeks.
3270 2018-11-14 18:41:44 Possibly, if you can deal with and manage the oil. There’s a fine line with everything though, like oil on your face. Finding a balance would be the best possible scenario. Have you tried hair masks or switching shampoos/conditioners?
3271 2018-11-14 18:41:39 I don't see it as a controversy tho, perhaps it's been too long for some people to remember what it's like for players competing for jobs, this situation will settle itself, long season ahead, 2 guys playing for a new contract @nielsonTSN1260 @BruceMcCurdy

3273 2018-11-14 18:41:26 Crude oil's collapse sends shock waves across global markets. To hell with big oil. And to hell with manipulating world markets. They've robbed us for over 70 years. Eliminate the need for the product, eliminate the product. Oil & coal is poisoning us & our children to death.

A dude who’s such a great guy doesn’t dump the bodies of his own children in oil tanks then lie about what happened. 
Appears they may be the sociopaths who created a murderer.
3276 2018-11-14 18:41:15 Is this why Natural Gas is still bullish while oil is down 20% in a month?
3277 2018-11-14 18:41:13 Politician or snake oil salesman? He's like the bully at the back of the classroom stopping everyone else from learning.
3278 2018-11-14 18:41:08 Did you on purposely omitted Russian from the list of oil waivers?
3279 2018-11-14 18:41:04 Oil prices rose, recouping some of the previous session’s slide, on the growing prospect of OPEC and allied producers cutting output at a meeting next month to prop up the market
3280 2018-11-14 18:40:59 Honestly unsure what AB economy will look like past 2025 when oil hits parity with electric cars. Well I mean we are just giving it away in AB but you know what I mean.
3281 2018-11-14 18:40:50 Bring me that meat wey get oil
3282 2018-11-14 18:40:50 Ahahahaha, donny boy's administration stands up for Muslims! Watch out for the oil in this plot, lol
3283 2018-11-14 18:40:48 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
3284 2018-11-14 18:40:47 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3285 2018-11-14 18:40:33 it’s a start but unless you stop selling branded products that contain palm oil I see this as nothing more than a clever advertising campaign,

3288 2018-11-14 18:40:16 "Global Warming is a myth created by big science for profit". What's more likely...? 98% of the scientific community lying to get at most a couple hundred thousand dollars in government grant... OR the oil industry lying to make potentially TRILLIONS off fucking over our planet?
3289 2018-11-14 18:40:16 Already found  a hole in that  bollocks.. a lot of the undiscovered/underdeveloped  resources  may be too  expensive to  extract,  to deep etc. We have used up a great  deal of the easily accessible oil.
3290 2018-11-14 18:40:10 We get almost nothing.  Once the oil or bitumen is out of the ground, it belongs to the private sector firms that extract it.  They are getting whatever they want to pay themselves.  Largely, they are shipping it to themselves and their friends south of the border.
3291 2018-11-14 18:40:05 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
3292 2018-11-14 18:40:03 Love how this oil is treating my skin. At times as oily skinned woman we forget that we also need some oil for our skip. We focus on stripping the oils off the skin. Ending with patchy dry skin then breaking out. #girtalkza #acne #dryskin #coriumskincare

3294 2018-11-14 18:40:01 But I'm glad you believe in someone. I kind of doubt that the Kenney will be the solution to a glut in oil due to the fracking boom in the USA. Both the Left and the Right appear to be paranoid about "lies" and it's boring for me to track each side's misgivings. Good luck.
3295 2018-11-14 18:39:59 They say Cheerios good for your castor oil. Might have to add a lil sugar to it

3300 2018-11-14 18:39:44 HAVE YOU TRIED CBD OIL?
3301 2018-11-14 18:39:31 right I think it's bc rising oil production and demand isn't matching
3302 2018-11-14 18:39:31 I use Pam canola oil spray so in my dishwasher so that the detergent pods don’t stick in the tray during washing.  Hope @KenDBerryMD approves of that, since I don’t use it for cooking anymore!
3303 2018-11-14 18:39:28 None of the items I listed above can be addressed by building pipelines. Dilbit is more expensive to ship and has a lower yield vs conventional oil.
3304 2018-11-14 18:39:22 G-11 guy is okayish. It's cheap so I'd say it's value for money. Went to Kim Mun for the first time and felt like having pulao while I was having Egg fried rice. Chicken chilli dry was all soaked up in oil and it was equally as expensive as Asian Wok which is miles better.
3305 2018-11-14 18:39:20 Stealing an oil cart nets you a 10 dollar bounty but 50 bucks at the fence. If only Dutch would listen to a real criminal mastermind in Arthur he's be on his way to riches already.
3306 2018-11-14 18:39:13 Lemme stove a few Apples, oranges, and bacon up his ass, then crushed thyme, sage, oregano,  mixed with melted butter and olive oil over his mooobs and legs... Oh yeah,..  salt and pepper liberally?...   sound no crazier then his ass looks
3307 2018-11-14 18:39:12 That tells me Westminster's been doing a piss poor job of handling our finances. 

And lol at the "we pump" - #UnionOfEquals my arse.  Gas, oil, whisky - been running that pile of cack at Westminster for decades.
3308 2018-11-14 18:39:04 Definitely it is not because of Iran. Some of these countries are relied heavily on Iran's oil & gas. It seems the US administration wants to incorporate some of its key allies into the its unlawful policy of extraterritorial application of national laws.
3309 2018-11-14 18:39:03 Senator, those guys have counted what's not there a lot. Like when they pass budgets that will only balance IF they can get a constitutional amendment passed that will allow them to steal money from the Oil and Gas Trust Fund.
3310 2018-11-14 18:38:55 Also, they weren't "blockading" the Pacific. The Japanese had a much larger fleet in the Pacific than the US. I think the term you are looking for is "embargo." And that was only on supplies that they could influence, such as oil.

3315 2018-11-14 18:38:28 As soon as they can dump or limit oil based fuels it will give the Saudis a good kicking too

3321 2018-11-14 18:37:32 Have you switched up your #skincareroutine lately? Trade in lotions and gels for creams that have a higher oil content to lock in moisture and keep skin hydrated longer on chilly days. #WellnessWednesday
3322 2018-11-14 18:37:30 Amazing how the most common of items can create an explosive: peroxide & nail polish remover. Motor oil & fertilizer. Stuff at one time found in almost every home. Inhalants that can kill when mixed: bleach & ammonia. That is all scary.

3324 2018-11-14 18:37:06 I’m off to get some CBD oil. I’m using it to treat this anxiety that’s been shutting me down lately. The doctors don’t give me anything I can abuse like benzodiazepines due to my alcoholic past. So the options are limited. It would be huge if it helps.
3325 2018-11-14 18:37:00 Too bad dems reversed their decision on taking money from big oil in only two months.

But sure...they'll be the ones to save the environment!

3337 2018-11-14 18:35:54 I'm pretty sure why us Jocks voted to remain in the UK was because of the very unpredictable oil market and the potential to leave Scotland on our arses !
3338 2018-11-14 18:35:51 When I said I was looking for someone who lights fires I was thinking more of someone in a Tweed jacket lighting a stove, or an open fire, some oil lamps, maybe some candles... But a whole building eh? Not really what I'm looking for right now but I'll keep you in mind.
3339 2018-11-14 18:35:49 Why is an oil change $70? Like really

I give them more oil to stay strong

3365 2018-11-14 18:33:53 Personally, I'm glad that #Iceland Advert was banned. We've got enough shit in our lives to worry about (#Brexit, #Trump ect.) Without adding extra worry about Palm Oil. 

Let's sort this shit first and that shit later...

3367 2018-11-14 18:33:36 What about their oil?  We don’t have anything that will produce the funds to allow you to have what you want and need. Taxes give you security along with many services you can’t pay for alone.
3368 2018-11-14 18:33:34 I find humor in getting my oil changed and them explaining everything to me as if I’m clueless. Like bro I do this stuff for a living

3376 2018-11-14 18:33:07 this pipeline is old but well taken care of and oil companies that caused spill were fined heavily and made them shut down till the leak was fixed many years ago and 1 person shot the pipeline the spill was at the drill site and not the pipeline
3377 2018-11-14 18:33:05 It astounds me that in the UK they ban a moving and poignant advert about the effects of Palm Oil consumption at the same time as allowing the absolutely abhorrent adverts like the Sun Bingo ad.

3379 2018-11-14 18:32:49 Absent combining it with White, Black ect, it has a simple plain meaning. 
Stigmatizing the concept of putting ones own country 1st is the ultimate goal here. Climate change, poverty, hunger, inequality demands this concept be eliminated along with the word.
3380 2018-11-14 18:32:48 Hi , We'd like to assure you that we're as concerned as you are about this, which is why we're committed to the responsible sourcing of Palm Oil. We're members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),
3381 2018-11-14 18:32:48 I'm sure the fine fishermen of Peterhead are happy about the SNP staying in the Common fisheries policy? How would you make oil or renewables less wasteful? Would you nationalise them? Then what? It takes a lot of machinery and expertise to extract oil or generate power.
3382 2018-11-14 18:32:48 India's services + goods exports increased from 73B to 490B USD between 2002 and 2017. Around 6.7X. China's from 333B to 2.4T USD. ~7X. We beat ourselves up needlessly. Our only real weakness is oil and gold imports messing up CAD from the import side and hurting INR-USD.
3383 2018-11-14 18:32:44 and 10 year sinking fast ? Oil in the dump ?   what else is coming ?
3384 2018-11-14 18:32:35 Seriously
3385 2018-11-14 18:32:27 NEW FOUNDATION I LOVE: MAC prolongwear nourishing waterproof. Lord this is the truth. 

Longwearing, fullcoverage, Satin finish (aka demi matte), fragrance free. Waterproof and hydrating, oil controlling. - I’ve had so many compliments on how my skin looks 
3386 2018-11-14 18:32:26 I am not anti-BJP but Modi govt has done little for oil alternative. Just bring down GST to 0% on eV & Hydrogen vehicle, Provide incetive for charging stations and hydrogen fuel station, Let the import comes with rider set in 2-3 year of local manufacturing.
3387 2018-11-14 18:32:23 my essential oil diffuser just came in the mail and WHEW I LOVE IT SO MUCH i might fuck around n not vaccinate my kids
3388 2018-11-14 18:32:18 Phil, I'm surprised at you

Does Walmart charge their customers to park? 

Forget that, you say it costs TA? Are we now counting TA's expenses?

Good, let's do this Remember volume purchases cost less to the buyer

Let's take oil. A PM costs $18.99/gal at TA, out of a drum...
3389 2018-11-14 18:32:17 It’s not like a switch that you turn off.  There will be oil rigs, etc for quite awhile.  But we need to start getting serious “yesterday”
3390 2018-11-14 18:32:15 "Hopefully not cutting oil production!  I don't give a shit that they are cutting up journalists aka enemies of the people aka fake news people."

3392 2018-11-14 18:32:06 While the world demand for oil & gas goes up, Canada screws half the country.
3393 2018-11-14 18:32:05 okay i see where you are coming from . but also , it’s dickinson , you never know when u will get laid off at an oil field job  and the creepy men 
3394 2018-11-14 18:32:03 HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CHANGE OIL!?
3395 2018-11-14 18:31:59 Dem's are relentless at driving their narratives. Elite globalists have their propaganda media working in unison and matching step, with wicked, paid for political sell outs that preach lies to naive audience who eats, and lives in false reality provided by snake oil politicians.
3396 2018-11-14 18:31:59 Unwinding of the long #oil/short nat gas trade, driving some of this move, traders say -- U.S. natural gas futures up 18 percent (!) to the highest since early 2014 #natgas #natty #energy

3398 2018-11-14 18:31:29 when it comes to cauliflower I like to cook it on sunflower oil and add a bunch of seasoning. also imo cauliflower by itself is kinda boring so I usually add carrots or yams or something
3399 2018-11-14 18:31:27 If we are going to sell oil to new markets someone will have to build  Cokers. If we won't why should anyone else?
3400 2018-11-14 18:31:23 Does your hot rod still Rock that model-T engine?

Let's take a hundred years, and all the money that was dumped into oil technology, and see where solar goes...
3401 2018-11-14 18:31:20 I’m trying to figure out the same! Oil change was $75, oil filter $14, tax... seems too high
3402 2018-11-14 18:31:13 @realDonaldTrump You were saying Oil prices were too high, what about Natural Gas? Shouldn’t people be able to heat their homes at reasonable price? Major price manipulation, when does government step in?
3403 2018-11-14 18:31:11 Adios al gas oil y la gasolina... Los jeques ya aprenden a vender pilas!!
3404 2018-11-14 18:30:59 My fav oil so far is the Girls Scout Cookies
3405 2018-11-14 18:30:58 The simple gel moisturizer is awesome. Us with oily skin have to use water based moisturizers. Or a lightweight oil.
3406 2018-11-14 18:30:58 yup and boycott any product with palm oil.
3407 2018-11-14 18:30:52 We don’t need a repeat of the east coast cod industry with oil in western Canada. Alberta through to Ont should start their own separatist movement. BC and Quebec don’t give a shit about them.

3415 2018-11-14 18:30:07 If all resources are finite then you would have to catalog all resources individually.  This is the proof you need but do not have.  So you replace it with bold statements.  You seem to be implying that burning oil is the pinnacle of universal discovery.
3416 2018-11-14 18:29:47 When you're camping or hiking, mosquitoes and other insect pests can take a bite out of your sunny disposition. Care to guess the two most effective pest repellent herbs? That would be catnip and peppermint (preferably peppermint oil).
3417 2018-11-14 18:29:42 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
3418 2018-11-14 18:29:39 There is a spot overlooking the Northern Catskill Mountains that I always thought should be captured by a large format camera, over the course of a year. The light changes dramatically minute bt minute. The Hudson River School painters would capture an instant in oil paint.
3419 2018-11-14 18:29:32 Cryptocurrencies have nothing to do with capitalism. 

Currency in capitalism is just a tool, a medium of exchange. It's the oil, not the machine. 

Cryptocurrency's value fluctuates wildly, so it is pretty useless as currency. It's just a dumb pyramid scheme.
3420 2018-11-14 18:29:14 Typical! The per diem brigade has gone for cooking oil shopping. I have witnessed this first hand in Amsterdam when these delegates would not attend meetings but instead, asked me to help them go shopping. A reflection on the country ethics.

Then I add a drizzle of sesame oil and sesame seeds.
3424 2018-11-14 18:28:49 I have an unreasonable belief that a few drops of lavender oil mixed coconut oil will literally fix anything. *results not guaranteed
3425 2018-11-14 18:28:48 so you only help rainforest destruction in a small way!?? I won't be eating any Cadbury products until you use 100% sustainable palm oil or no palm oil!
3426 2018-11-14 18:28:46 Would you consider getting to a place where you remove palm oil altogether from your products? #PalmOil #Deforestation
3427 2018-11-14 18:28:39 USA has increased production as well as our administration stating that keeping prices low is a priority for them. Oil prices have been discussed relative to sanction structuring with Trump himself stating that he does not wish to create a situation in which oil prices jump.

3429 2018-11-14 18:28:23 I think if people were made more aware of this and the Palm Oil epidemic that big corporations are running, it would be a totally different story. To destroy a creature's habitat knowing that it is wrong is something that lacks the most basic of human traits_compassion.
3430 2018-11-14 18:28:15 Because they remind me so much of you, cowardly, bullies, thick, tyrannical, ignorant, obsessive, fraudulent, fake, snide, lying snake oil sellers, jackal, snob.
All the good things about fascists posing as  liberals
3431 2018-11-14 18:28:13 The biggest scam ever perpetrated by Wall Street, was "Peak Oil Theory" POT. POT is what they must have been smoking....
3432 2018-11-14 18:28:08 I'm going to try to take a bath for the first time since I lathered myself in coconut oil for a deep body renewal only to slip and fall in the tub, sending a Nathan-sized cylinder of water flying against the wall and across the floor
3433 2018-11-14 18:28:00 All the easy-to-access oil and gas resources are near exhausted, this is how they can justify it. Fortunately the term 'fracking' itself gets enough people exercised enough to do the research and once informed any normal person does everything possible to rise up to fight it.
3434 2018-11-14 18:27:55 No. Mine just forms by itself. I wash, oil and go...
3435 2018-11-14 18:27:48 The type of investment should be considered too. A permanent resident buying a farm (under all our regulations, labour laws, tax obligations etc) does simply help finance our development. Others can be noxious ie waterbottling or oil rigs

3441 2018-11-14 18:26:39 And has stolen it's oil fields. It has also financed head choppers who take delight in also crucifying people. You are an ignorant idiot. President Bashar Al Assad has more courage integrity and honour than you could ever hope to achieve. The USA needs to get out of Syria.

3444 2018-11-14 18:26:14 @jairbolsonaro @CGTNOfficial @CNN @ChinaDaily @JornalOGlobo @CNS1952 @FinancialTimes @GloboNews Brazil needs to accelerate the production of pre-salt and start exporting oil.

3448 2018-11-14 18:25:53 What was the policy? Reserves were depleted and we couldn't sustain a drop in oil prices as our reserves were not enough. This lead to recessing and currency devaluation. It was experienced in over 12 countries including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Angola. It was not a policy

3450 2018-11-14 18:25:41 We tax capital gains at half the rate we tax the working class.

Off the top of my head, we also give over $3 billion a year to subsidize big oil, we give the apartheid state of Israel about $4 billion a year, we give $70 billion to Homeland Security and $600 billion for the DoD.

3453 2018-11-14 18:25:20 All these stupid people in the comments saying they won't support OREOS anymore because it's made with Palm Oil. Do you all not understand or see that OREOS isn't the only product made up of PALM OIL???!! Like are you all ignorant enough to have to pick on OREOS for something
3454 2018-11-14 18:25:19 As I said, reject it if you like. There are at least a million smart guys every day w/ no experience in the oil & gas business ready to reject everything that came before them & proclaim a brave new world. Tienes la batuta!

3459 2018-11-14 18:24:42 Oil abd Auto cartel won’t let it happen, Since las for years they are still deciding charging standards for EV???How much money govt spent on eV infrastructure??? Hydrogen Infrastructure?? why charge 12% GST ??? If govt is serious.
3460 2018-11-14 18:24:40 Aren't you big oil and big gas's rubber stamp?  Don't you like voting so we can ruin the environment? Since when did you care about Estes Park since their tourism industry is based off the great outdoors? #ByeFeliciaIn2020
3461 2018-11-14 18:24:39 And their detailed report on $1 overnight price jumps pumping oil to $76? Yeah right whatever GS . 
If anything these 4th qtr moves are another collective banking PD job and the eagerness to explain it is our red flag.

3468 2018-11-14 18:23:52 You could have bought oil at $76,  amazon at $2000. Could have been worse indeed.

3470 2018-11-14 18:23:49 1 #talk2tonyecole Sir,  cultism and ocultism are now norms in Rivers State. Youths are subjected to fill ocultic forms in other to gain employment into the oil industries and any good job. The excesses of the OGBONI FRATANITY is no longer a secret in d state.

3472 2018-11-14 18:23:35 It’s the same kind of oil on the outside of tarantula joints. Maybe different than some dab formulations? I’m not well versed on all the extraction processes. I smoke weed. But I like to boost my joints w hash for mentrual pain.

3475 2018-11-14 18:23:18 Not really a surprise, as US became the major oil producer  this week. They would do all they can to see a drop in the price of oil
3476 2018-11-14 18:23:16 I was thinking about standard oil
3477 2018-11-14 18:23:08 You can rub sime garlic or castor oil on them they should be able to make them grow faster
3478 2018-11-14 18:23:04 I agree completely although it's pushing the term "politician" to the limit. Freak show huckster, snake oil salesman would be more appropriate.

3481 2018-11-14 18:22:55 @kcoplan you never replied to my argument re legality of playing un-favorites with oil companies. They are threatening rebels, so section 9 “unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it” applies. Does something else restrict exec order?
3482 2018-11-14 18:22:54 Hurts the Saudis, Iran and Russia and helps media darling China however. We should source label oil so people can choose to pay a little more for civilized countries oil
3483 2018-11-14 18:22:46 Oh rilly? 'cause I learned it means I want to make sweet, sweet love to all the oil companies, and also that my pussy hat is too tight. Because these people are the "real liberals."
3484 2018-11-14 18:22:45 I have a nephew very closely involved in the legal aspects of Brexit for the govt. I know he's been burning the midnight oil ever since the vote. People don't appreciate the hard work hundreds if not thousands have put into it but too quick to criticise.
3485 2018-11-14 18:22:43 I think Dubai is doing good there are some sectors which are dependent on oil, they are facing a hard time apart from that other sectors are doing good. As per my understanding current recession is only for high paid salary in oil sectors crude oil came to 63$. Which is alarming

3492 2018-11-14 18:22:04 It's estimated that from what was promised by Salmon (8B in oil revenue) was vastly over estimated. you guys made 1/200 Million in oil revenue.

3514 2018-11-14 18:19:13 Then spraying will definitely help, also oil them once in a while and the discoloration will go away
3515 2018-11-14 18:19:10 66$ is actually a temporary support level. I foster it going back into the $70-80 level. Saudi Arabia is cutting back its drilling so oil should go up.  The npf guys contributed to the hike but it's also an international market scenario that is outside our hands
3516 2018-11-14 18:19:04 All this while Alberta oil sells at a $50 a barrel discount.

3530 2018-11-14 18:17:28 Felt like I just got an oil change... hopefully my dad can get it done for me
3531 2018-11-14 18:17:22 Food for thought, thanks. The thing that bothers me about palm oil is that it's in a lot of vegan stuff (a lot of junk, admittedly). If when trying to encourage people to go vegan palm oil is ruled out as well I feel like it would make it more challenging. I eat palm oil...

3554 2018-11-14 18:14:49 I’m not a fan of Vaping, but I rather my Kid Vape some fruit flavored oil other than sucking on a cigarette.

3555 2018-11-14 18:14:38 Bigger still is the rather arbitrary adjustment of regression lines for this post 2014 reality, where oil is devalued. Can just as easily look like a false optimism of supply availability phase in a few months.

Anyone following these curves two years ago expected $100+ by now.

My Ingredients

A cup of Egusi = N300
Dry chilli pepper = N100
Crayfish = N150
Stockfish = N400
Meat = N700
Seasoning = N50
Red Oil = 100

I have garri, and there's gas to cook. I must eat this Egusi soup this evening

3567 2018-11-14 18:13:54 Once a day spray both sides of the wall with used motor oil.
3568 2018-11-14 18:13:47 But didn't you know it is a burden all that oil Westminster said so it must be true....we really must tell that to Norway

3582 2018-11-14 18:12:20 Hi, we never purchase palm oil from any country where production could impact orangutans. Our supplier guarantees our palm oil comes from long established organic palm plantations and small scale farms - and that these farms are cultivated in a sustainable & organic manner.
3583 2018-11-14 18:12:15 That's been reported before -- and is one reason QC sees no need for Energy-East, which is primarily to export oil
3584 2018-11-14 18:12:15 Umfundisi wamanga...that oil is fishy...
3585 2018-11-14 18:12:09 We're getting 15 dollars a barrel Tom @cbcwatcher8 while "world oil prices" are 60-70 a barrel, costing us 100's of millions every day, because our country will not allow us to export our product to anyone except the US. Imagine if that was any other industry in Canada.

3587 2018-11-14 18:12:01 Haha you think the "world" understands or considers the consequences of its actions. 

And the "world" is actually just a handful of gigantic corporations frantically trying to get every drop of oil out of the ground before the bubble bursts
3588 2018-11-14 18:12:01 Hey hon...do some REAL research.  The average time for an oil company to get an oil well drilled is EIGHT YEARS!

You look really uninformed.
3589 2018-11-14 18:11:57 Oil too low. We need more sanctions

3593 2018-11-14 18:11:48 For me: half a cup of rice per person, to one cup of slightly salted boiling water. Simmer for about ten minutes with lid on. Turn off and let stand for a few minutes.

3597 2018-11-14 18:11:33 This is the goal. Currently all things the left finds unacceptable and in need of demonization lead back to Nazi Germany. The comparisons they make are endless. Most, having little real understanding just nod in agreement and repeat this nonesense
3598 2018-11-14 18:11:30 Homeopathic remedies have the greatest profit margin. No R&D cost, cheap ingredient(H2O). Puts snake oil to shame.
3599 2018-11-14 18:11:28 Mr. Carita. I agree that the press is not our enemy. But they are not our friends. They are single-minded corporate entities......Ratings. President Trump coverage will quickly slide to the back seat if someone shows up with Ebola in the U.S. or if an oil pipe breaks

Still no update on #Brexit - cabinet meeting entering hour 5; equities led lower by tech and energy; 2% rebound in oil on #OPEC chatter, but pales next to yesterday's 6% fall; USD on back foot following softer core-CPI; #NZD takes on all comers - higher across the board
3603 2018-11-14 18:10:54 I’m just sceptical that brands will advertise that they’re ‘palm oil free’ so that people think they’re responsible but the reality is that they’re doing more damage than before. Not an easy topic at all. If only there was a trusted global body to govern palm oil production.

3605 2018-11-14 18:10:52 Forgive me for being this person but any essential oil blend with wintergreen is good for that. *ducks* Just don’t pay $40 a bottle for the mommy blogger version.
3606 2018-11-14 18:10:50 IMO, that was your blow off top in $UNG and #natgas. Rumor out this am of a sizable fund hurt by being short #natgas and long #oil. Probably finished now.

3609 2018-11-14 18:10:29 Im all for telling the blunt truth, couldn't be tactful if I tried. Im not so keen on invading other countries for their oil though. That's what I was more referring to. But go ahead, sing his praises. He needs all the friends he can get outside the US
3610 2018-11-14 18:10:24 Wow.. learn something new everyday.. even though former Edmonton Oil King Tristan Jarry doesn't have his name on the Stanley Cup, he does have Two Cup Rings from the Pens to go along with his Memorial Cup..
3611 2018-11-14 18:10:21 teacher: yeah let me just spend this entire hour explaining oil painting to help you get started

3614 2018-11-14 18:10:16 I have no issues with algal DHA (although I can’t give dietary advice) but I distrust a lot of the astaxanthin supplements out there and prefer to get my astaxanthin through krill oil and H. Pluvialis (the algae that makes astaxanthin among many other carotenoids).

There's nothing here saying "it's different this time" - it's a logical reason why crude should build proportionally as a factor of refinery capacity.

3632 2018-11-14 18:08:54 The problem is the amount of land required to grow crops that can replace the palm oil. I don’t know enough about coconut but I can’t imagine it’s anywhere near as high yielding per acre. The amount of oil consumption does need to reduce but we have to be careful what replaces it
3633 2018-11-14 18:08:52 Right, that's it! It's the extra-glutinous boiling oil for you, come Monday evening...!

3636 2018-11-14 18:08:47 Its not a synonym of bad, it a synonym of always looking for profit. It's been evident in the past decade that unregulated corporations don't tend to help people, that's a fact. But please keep fighting for citizens united, let coporations like NRA and Big Oil control congress.
3637 2018-11-14 18:08:40 World Oil prices are not in the process of passing a federal bill which will essentially kill the viability of any new energy project ever again. World Oil prices did not quietly renew standing equalization formulas AFTER Alberta had become a "have not".

3642 2018-11-14 18:08:21 This is a great step forward. The world is starting to see the end to animal testing, palm oil &  to greater sustainability. But there is a long way to go. I hope those on here criticising you, can hand on heart say they NEVER use products with palm oil
3643 2018-11-14 18:08:15 America is the #1 oil producer in the world, soon will be spreading to our national parks, things they don’t tell you on the news, I’m not hippy but by 2050 we are going to be living real life Mad Max...

3647 2018-11-14 18:08:00 I agree and you are correct. I feel like my urban planning schtick has me conflicted because of the power dynamics of that position being for an oil company. It's like a developer hiring a neighbourhood representative - I always question that reps freedom to serve the community.

3656 2018-11-14 18:07:22 Ridiculous. Can you reverse your decision?  We need to inform the masses about things like this. Unless we do people will live in ignorance and carry on thinking Palm Oil is ok. The people want to see this ad. #PalmOil #IcelandAdvert
3657 2018-11-14 18:07:19 Thanks. So just to confirm - yes, they contain palm oil and no, they’re not sustainable yet but hopefully by the end of next year?
3658 2018-11-14 18:07:08 I don't agree. Everyone must work together for a greener world. Oil is not part of that climate saving evolution. #ahsbem2at
3659 2018-11-14 18:07:06 Can't we just get a bunch of people to pretend to be in the pockets of the oil lobby, get elected and then turn around be like "TIME TO DECARBONIZE, BITCHES!"

3664 2018-11-14 18:06:56 But we still buy their oil? Makes no sense...
3665 2018-11-14 18:06:47 Nationalism is the opposite of Transnationslism or Globalism. 

This word must be determined unacceptable as opposite to globalism by leftists. "Patriotic" can apply to larger international global community, nationalism cannot.
The concept must be eradicated
3666 2018-11-14 18:06:38 World Oil prices didn't stop Northern Gateway, Trans Mountain or Energy East cold in their tracks because this gov't prefers to import Oil from Saudi Arabia then use help it's own energy industry. World Oil prices didn't impose a Carbon Tax to make doing business in AB untenable.
3667 2018-11-14 18:06:33 When your headlights go out, oil needs to be changed, tire has a hole, nobody be around those times. Niggas don’t even need rides then lol
3668 2018-11-14 18:06:30 It's not a wait until oil and gas companies can afford us to not pollute. They need to be shut down from polluting and their assets from pollution should be taken to pay for their mess.

3671 2018-11-14 18:06:03 I cant be your highend detailer but i can certainly change your oil
3672 2018-11-14 18:05:59 To be fair KSA does export oil 
3673 2018-11-14 18:05:55 Doing that requires focus. Oil companies in government are preventing necessary focus. Keeping oil companies out requires their cooperation. Getting oil company cooperation requires disbanding one as an example of what happens to the others if they don’t stay out of government.
3674 2018-11-14 18:05:48 This leave in conditioner with tea tree oil and cinnamon is giving my hair life
3675 2018-11-14 18:05:43 Yeah.  Oil fields catch on fire.  Supply goes down.  Demand stays same.  Price increase.  Cause meet effect.

3679 2018-11-14 18:05:28 Hey all! Cruise ships are absolutely awful for ocean health as they discharge sewage, gray water, oil, and other pollutants directly into the water. They're hugely damaging and ought to be boycotted.

3686 2018-11-14 18:05:12 As insane as the oil drop was in the last few days, this natural gas spike is even nuttier. Total short squeeze. Even number of $5 coming up.
3687 2018-11-14 18:05:04 I use the nyx foundation drops and apply with a damp as hell real techniques beauty sponge! It usually look okay but I get dry skin in the cold weather so I’ve heard oil drops can help with patchiness
3688 2018-11-14 18:05:01 Ya buffers don't happen...but there is now something like 12 million square feet of empty office space that was built and never occupied. Wages are still high but property values crashed. The country needs pipelines to maximize revenues from oil. We lose $80 million a day now.
3689 2018-11-14 18:04:47 Apparently sustainable palm oil is in specific areas which doesn’t affect it as bad but if you boycott palm oil altogether they will just need to find an alternative which will still have devastating affects so it’s really bloody hard to get good knowledge or solutions.

3700 2018-11-14 18:03:56 Half way through the first paragraph I was going, “holy crap what is this stuff‽” So I looked it up and yup, makes sense.

Gerin oil—not even once.

(Personally I think even in small doses it can be very dangerous.)

3702 2018-11-14 18:03:44 Not confusing. Nobody trusts the UK anymore, snake oil peddlers have now a better reputation after the Brexidiots and Brextremists have ruled the roost.

Without a reckoning and removal/punishment of the idiots, no one with trust the UK anymore than they will trust Trump.
3703 2018-11-14 18:03:34 Just watched @GMB with @IcelandRichard ! It makes me so angry, is it really that hard to be supportive! Yes, they may still have @IcelandFoods produce with palm oil however, give credit! They are the first supermarket to verbally stand up and start the change! Stop finding fault

3705 2018-11-14 18:03:23 Yes, biotin helped me when blonde ruined my hair. I’m too lazy but the best thing for hair growth is Jamaican lavender castor oil and coconut oil. Spray it in a bottle all through out your scalp.
3706 2018-11-14 18:03:19 Our export performance is in perfect sync with China's. The fall is oil prices depressed export demand. We recovered along with China in past year or so. Demo and GST hurt for a couple of quarters.
3707 2018-11-14 18:03:19 kalau perdebatannya parfum tidak beralkohol tidak bisa menggantikan parfum alkohol itu bisa salah juga. karena perfum yang oil based/natural tanpa alkohol itu wanginya sebenernya lebih tahan lama

3713 2018-11-14 18:02:55 I utterly and completely reject this notion!

But I will say that a quick pickle on some onions or radishes is fantastic. A little ACV, olive oil, salt and pepper? Brine the veg in that for twenty minutes and you've got burger toppings.
3714 2018-11-14 18:02:55 Hey that’s ok. FR is getting counter-colonized too as well as the UK, GER, BeNeLux. Soon wages go down, police loose control, the fast boost of the economic engine with cheap oil will have a short positive but a fatal negative longterm effect. Anyway PL welcomes future refugees.

3719 2018-11-14 18:01:45 dan juga kalau lo pada tahu sejarahnya parfum, parfum yang tidak beralkohol  itu temuan peradaban islam, parfum yang beralokohol itu dibuat untuk meng-dilute parfum yg 100% natural oil untuk preservasi
3720 2018-11-14 18:01:43 "The EU has taken steps to …" Maybe will. "UK plans to reverse it " Maybe will.  Do we not deal in actual facts and real actions any more ??  Good cause; woolly presentation of argument. Nevertheless, we should avoid using palm oil and Halal food.

3730 2018-11-14 18:01:15 you have done nothing to fight for pipelines other than pay them lip service for political gain.  You want to help Alberta?  Call a election early and let Albertans decide who is best for our oil industry
3731 2018-11-14 18:01:09 For me, it’s all about the volume. Eg 4 fl oz rice (for one), with precisely double that amount of boiling water. Spot of salt, drip of oil. Stir once. Simmer on low heat (1/4 heat) for 20-22 minutes.

3734 2018-11-14 18:01:08 Yes, that's gotta be why the days have started getting shorter and temperatures are getting lower, too! Those bastards! They've probably cut the oil supply that keeps the Sun running, too! Let the riots begin!

3739 2018-11-14 18:00:51 My daughter who’s in HR with a major oil company was told to lay off 800 people. After she was done they laid her off too. Trump & the #CorruptGOP are full of shit. I can’t believe people hate minorities, women & LGBTQ communities more that they want a better life for themselves.

We've never really used them before, so the effects on the body aren't wonderful. Easy way to check if an oil is particularly bad for you, is to

NEVER get your animals high, for any reason. It isn't good for them. If your animal has an anxiety or compulsive disorder you're trying to treat, then use CBD oil only. But it must contain LESS THAN .3% THC.
3864 2018-11-14 17:50:07 That industry creates so much devastation everywhere. A few years ago we experienced the unbelievable smoke in Indonesia and Malaysia from fires set by the Palm Oil industry to clear virgin forests for plantations. It's terrible. Patti sounds like you have another book to write!!

3867 2018-11-14 17:49:58 Force the hand of the Liberal and Provincial Governments to build pipelines.  Over 20 Billion annually is lost to the Canadian economy by not being able to get our oil to domestic and foreign customers. Stop the insanity of buying imported oil. I plugged my nose and voted yes btw
3868 2018-11-14 17:49:55 可哀想…

3874 2018-11-14 17:49:17 Vivian is polite and uses data and good argument techniques to advance the interests of the oil ad gas industry against those of citizens. Catastrophic climate change is just what it sounds like. Climate science is not opinion, politics or economics, & Vivian is a CC denier.
3875 2018-11-14 17:49:14 Why can't artificial ponds be provided by @NashikCorp for Chhat Puja or any other festival, just like during Ganesh Chaturthi? Oil lamps could have been floated in artificial ponds thus sparing Ramkund

3887 2018-11-14 17:48:07 ya, he might've missed the old Salem and isolated himself over guilt and grief.
3888 2018-11-14 17:48:07 Raising taxes will kill what little investment that is remaining.This will certainly expedite the death spiral for the oil industry, I suppose a win for the NDP.  A kick them while they are down approach.
3889 2018-11-14 17:47:44 Romania (though it was Romania's choice to enter) and, late in the war, Baku in Azerbaijan (which was lawless after Russia's fall and had an Armenian population the Turks were keen to massacre) were targeted by the Central Powers for oil too.
3890 2018-11-14 17:47:30 put some coconut oil in there..for a real party
3891 2018-11-14 17:47:25 Health insurance itself is a ridiculous concept.  Your car insurance doesn’t cover oil changes does it?  Free market capitalism is the best solution for quality affordable healthcare.
3892 2018-11-14 17:47:19 The Really Real Reason behind Oil's Collapse:

• GlobalSlowDown
• strong US$
• oversupply
• HF long unwind
• CL/NG pair unwind
• seasonality
• momentum sellers
• trend followers
• margin calls

The real truth ? 
Guessing has many fathers, and true knowledge is an orphan
3893 2018-11-14 17:47:18 Is that a ring of dag oil at the tip?
3894 2018-11-14 17:47:18 Probably factors in oil changes, car repairs etc.
3895 2018-11-14 17:47:12 Hey hi! Try maybe aloe vera gel, it's great. Works also for moisturising hair (on the ends) and for styling it, and has many uses (like a natural lube too, handy, right? Lol). If you want something not too greasy to put with the aloe vera you can try hemp seed oil, it's amazing.

3910 2018-11-14 17:46:07 You can not win in Alberta with a anti oil platform.  Just like you can't win in West Virginia in a anti coal platform.  Pple will never vote against their livelihoods.
3911 2018-11-14 17:46:05 Actually McDonald's fries get there flavor from temperature and time in the deep fried. The fries themselves can be purchased by getting thin cut, non salted fries. That's what they are. Time and temp, plus salt them right after removal from the oil. While very hot!
3912 2018-11-14 17:45:50 Today is the most untogether day I’ve had in such a very long time. Low oil prices, fires, invaders are stressing me. When you are part of oil industry, no matter what you do, it affects you. Everything feeela so tenuous and not stable. I’m in the middle of a faith barrier
3913 2018-11-14 17:45:49 Remember Trump placed Rick Perry in charge of the department of energy ....and he thought it was just about dealing with oil companies- needless to say he is not a nuclear physicist ....

3916 2018-11-14 17:45:31 Those stats are questionable. Investors are NOT clamoring 2 come here due 2 almost impossible regulations. Trudeau used $4.5 BILLION tax $ 2 buy pipeline he won't build & thousands r unemployed. Our oil sells at 1/4 of world prices. He's giving billions $ to foreign countries...
3917 2018-11-14 17:45:29 Glad to spread the word! All companies need to get rid of palm oil! 
3918 2018-11-14 17:45:29 I played real fast and loose with rose quartz and rose oil and now I’m irritated with the attention from men I’m getting. (Somehow managed to conjur a weeping sack of emotions, my psychotic ex, a boring old man who wanted to wife me before he met me )

3925 2018-11-14 17:45:11 I was taught how to change a tire, check my oil, the basics but ask me if I'ma do it.
3926 2018-11-14 17:45:07 Would it be because of larger share of oil/commodity producing countries in EEM?

The divergence could be on account of higher % representation by CAD countries in this group in the last few years.

Y’all I’m blessed I’m living with an angel
3932 2018-11-14 17:44:46 It should be shown and let people decide if they want to stuff their face with cookies made with palm oil or ones made with an alternative ingredient. There are lobbyists for palm oil no doubt. Lots of money to be made in the production. Can’t upset the money train. #AirIt
3933 2018-11-14 17:44:41 Do the math crude oil down by 16% n rupee appreciated by 3% in that period  so what should be the drop in petrol prices oh great economist n mathematician

3936 2018-11-14 17:44:29 [2/2] So while yes this is promoting the fact they don't use palm oil in their products, there is nothing to help negate the deforestation for palm oil. Not only this but they say nothing about their branded products
I think sharing the original ad would be more beneficial imo
3937 2018-11-14 17:44:28 even oil went down on it....

3942 2018-11-14 17:43:43 The economy began this current cycle after the fiscal crisis of 2008. Corporate earnings/consumer spending/oil prices determine how the economy is doing. The recent tax cuts benefits corporations and the rich, and the market likes this; nothing substantial has changed for you.
3943 2018-11-14 17:43:41 Wait, wasn't GB supposed to be a blood thirsty oil tycoon who didn't care about human life and lied to get us into a war for money?

3950 2018-11-14 17:43:03 After today's conference session, some participants & I were having a chat about various issues when the discussion fell on the subject of my disappointment with our perilous reliance on oil revenues only & our failure to diversify when one of the individuals said and I quote:
3951 2018-11-14 17:42:58 The oil sector makes up 9% of the economy.  It'll be around.  Trudeau is clearly making very bad decisions like the Trans Mountain debacle. The guy running Trans Mountain got a promotion I think to Houston after he dumped that disaster in the works on the Canadian government..Sad

3957 2018-11-14 17:42:11 I see, but what about indirectly? Were incomes not high, though? Oil headquarters are there, right? Shouldn’t the property taxes have been high enough to create reserves to buffer the low times? I suppose that takes the political will, but I’m guessing it was possible.

3959 2018-11-14 17:42:06 You have to invest in other technologies or even old technologies (wind mills are an old concept) to find out what the next fuel source could be. There are also issues like destruction of forests for Palm Oil in the tropics. Animal and modern agriculture.

It has to stop, and i dont think i‘ll make such a difference but together i hope we will.
3964 2018-11-14 17:41:51 @BootsHelp Hiya. Your Sun, Swim and Gym shampoo is great but looks like it might contain a nut oil derivative (sodium Laureth sulfate). Is that from palm oil? Thanks!

3973 2018-11-14 17:41:08 I'm pretty sure they do say only their own brand products are going to be completely palm oil free/ only from sustainable sources
3974 2018-11-14 17:41:05 @APPropst     If oil continues to fall wouldn't that make the demand higher and the GDP level rise?

3985 2018-11-14 17:40:05 Obviously we agree on the zero deforestation but for a major brand to write off certified sustainable palm oil isn’t going to help the situation.
3986 2018-11-14 17:40:04 We have enough oil to destroy the earth without ever running out. We dont need anymore. Holy shit its like america is being ran by a bunch of broke people who only care about money.

3998 2018-11-14 17:38:58 We aught to wonder if the same oleaginous denizens of TaxHeaven (who replaced the horse with motor cars; who's never ending oil wars etc...) aren't behind the present human desexualization (non-reporoductive) effort.

4005 2018-11-14 17:38:12 Some background : pgnig from poland claimed 10 d ago they were buying us lng at “20/30 % discount” to  russian oil linked gas. Clearly not true now
4006 2018-11-14 17:38:11 Kinda like saying if I carpool I can save the environment, instead of blaming oil companies.
4007 2018-11-14 17:38:10 Damn you Princeton! Caught me in a moment of grammatical weakness. I’m shamed. Now make me your best floppy hat offer. And I don’t need any more red beard oil, so just move on...

4009 2018-11-14 17:38:01 Well do you have oil?!
4010 2018-11-14 17:37:59 Seriously. And that insufferable laugh! My oil business man, father-in-law makes that same laugh when we try to talk facts to him about climate change. Drives me NUTS! So condescending.
4011 2018-11-14 17:37:58 I’m using “Dove Intensive Repair” about 2-3 times a week and my hair got a lot healthier and imo it looks and feels thicker then before. I had really weak and sad hair before starting to use that. Also you can try out to drench it in hair oil once a week. 
4012 2018-11-14 17:37:58 Did it involve invading oil rich countries?
4013 2018-11-14 17:37:53 Now is the time to close the border and start indyref2 and become our own country again we have the oil and gas industry we don't need WM to tell us how to run our country. We certainly don't need to be forced out of Europe if the tories and Labour want to brexit the door is open

4019 2018-11-14 17:37:21 There is plenty of oil, just how they will manipulate the next piece of news that throws the market into the right place... money talks... oil had its day.. its time for the reality to set in ... 55-75 is where it will fluctuate.. probably lower to 48-58 ... we'll see..

4021 2018-11-14 17:37:12 I think his disclosure was the right thing to do however I would advised him to be prepared with a medical note or research articles on the difference between oil used for medical purposes and straight-out cannabis.
4022 2018-11-14 17:37:09 @FairQuestions Finally good to see some traction. Our Alberta oil and gas is produced by bright, friendly, happy folks. We live and play on this land and have the highest environmental standards anywhere. I want that narrative out there. Good work. Keep at it.

4032 2018-11-14 17:36:32 Sad to hear Rang-tan destroyed to clear the road to palm oil -
If we do not act, more expensive habitats will be destroyed, indigenous peoples may lose their homes, and Rangtan and Mina make a rope that makes the forest only because of the palm oil and damage the ozone hole
4033 2018-11-14 17:36:29 Oil falls, yet BP is up 0.60.

4035 2018-11-14 17:36:18 Few positive things I believe:
1) Crude oil prices have entered into bearish mode
2) Ind-Japan signing Currency Swap of 75 billion USD.( this helped INR to bounce back)
Other factors such as Trump losing elections to Democrats & European markets are bleeding because of Brexit 
4036 2018-11-14 17:36:15 Thanks really appreciate it! Combination of oil pastel, acrylic, and collage pieces.

4041 2018-11-14 17:35:44 Motorists could pay less at the pump as global oil prices take a knock. Oil prices have dipped from a high of 85 dollars per barrel to the current 67 dollars per barrel.

where’s my ‘happy thoughts’ at?????
4043 2018-11-14 17:35:40 I think about this made the mistake of looking at Xi'an's website and now all I want is hot oil noodles
4044 2018-11-14 17:35:37 Yes! People often forget about the social side of production. Smallholders produce 40% of palm oil, working with them to achieve sustainable certification is essential to transform the industry. They in turn again access to new markets and achieve higher yields (from less land).
4045 2018-11-14 17:35:33 Trump took credit for oil prices dropping now he is quickly passing the buck before prices soar. Trump should return to Saudi Arabia and rub the King's orb again and see if oil production goes up! Sad.

4054 2018-11-14 17:34:50 Are you aware that PMB had consistently sold oil above the budgeted benchmark since he came to power? What does he have to show for it? 
What has he done that is away from the past corrupt ways of former leaders but to establish a nepotic order and protect his party men?
4055 2018-11-14 17:34:49 It’s in just about everything. I’ve seen firsthand the damage African Palm monoculture has wrought. Check ingredients. I’m not even sure what ‘sustainable’ palm oil is? Nonsense methinks.
4056 2018-11-14 17:34:48 I empty myself of yesterday's oil.

I have a new pot. Fill it up Lord.

May I never run out of pots.

May I never rely on yesterday's oil.

Thank You Jesus.
4057 2018-11-14 17:34:40 Let me cause trouble in your system..

Remember when Mary Magdalene carried her oil from her Alabaster and poured on Jesus' feet?.. Judas said they could have sold that oil and use the money to feed the poor but Jesus insisted that she poured it all.

4064 2018-11-14 17:33:44 Idk what they did but I think that’s what they said? What was it? Idk. They did it bc I went 3000 over on my oil change. I’m stupid, don’t laugh
4065 2018-11-14 17:33:31 For anyone who has rode in my car recently: I scheduled an oil change for tomorrow 
4066 2018-11-14 17:33:31 Scotland has made an unbelievably disproportionate contribution to the Westminster and oil company coffers over the past 50 years. When a national resource is being exploited it is folly to leave the exploitation to private companies.
4067 2018-11-14 17:33:28 I’ll do a review after I’ve had plenty of time using @JohnnyNoblebody’s Face Oil. So far, I really like the smell, and my face feels less dry.

My wife, @Lucky_JC35 loves the sugar scrub. Says that it smells like rich people 
4068 2018-11-14 17:33:16 Yes he bloody should. Sold us Iraq based on a lie. I hear the oil companies are doing very well out of it.
4069 2018-11-14 17:33:16 Don’t just pick on Amazon though. It’s corporations in general. Focus on oil companies if you need to focus on something. Subsidies to oil companies hurt our budget AND the environment.

4103 2018-11-14 17:30:59 Interesting. So if there's a bounce back to previous levels say over Dec (2% jump in prices today), there will be no change? Makes sense though because these oil marketers or their traders should ideally be dealing with futures contracts and not spot prices.
4104 2018-11-14 17:30:59 The US certainly needed oil.  Could others provide it? Yes.  Can other companies provide services AMZN does?  Yes.

AMZN has no powers of government.  Gov't defines AMZN's freedom of action and backs that with use of force.  AMZN has no such comparable power.

4106 2018-11-14 17:30:36 Palm oil makes loads of money. One way is to buy refined palm oil and the detritus left over when it is refined. Governments subsidise exports of refined palm oil. Then mix the detritus back into the palm oil as governments subsidise the import of unrefined palm oil. Profitable,

4114 2018-11-14 17:30:10 A 'boycott' implies that no palm oil will be used, come what may, whereas Iceland refuses to use it UNTIL it can be shown to be deforestation-free. That's not the same as calling for a boycott. I refuse to use palm oil until I can be sure it's deforestation free.

4129 2018-11-14 17:28:58 You’d be amazed at what Neem soap, Pure African Black soap, Tea tree oil, Pure African Shea butter, and coconut oil does for our skin.... I’m telling you the naturalist way is the way to live

4131 2018-11-14 17:28:54 Looks like @Tzeporah likes Saudi oil - maybe she likes how they treat their women???just saying.... could be wrong??
4132 2018-11-14 17:28:51 I love my POTUS.  Bring on the anti gravity devises and we won't need big oil at all!
4133 2018-11-14 17:28:48 @mrlube Been waiting 3 hrs for oil and tire service after being told it was a 45min-1hr wait.
Then told your other location had a 1hr wait time and go over there. Arrive there and I’m told the wait is 3hrs. Now wasted half a day (so far)... won’t be back. #customerservicefail
4134 2018-11-14 17:28:47 Guess I’ll go to cvs again to get oil
4135 2018-11-14 17:28:43 But I like the aveeno creamy oat oil better than pcb.
4136 2018-11-14 17:28:36 Away and don't talk so much shite.....Do you think we would just give up the oil reserves in the north sea & those as yet untapped off the west coast to Engerlund?

I think you should go homeward to think again..... 
4137 2018-11-14 17:28:33 Brexit won't really matter by 2040 global warming is likely going to cause wars over mass migration as people try to escape extreme weather conditions.
Shame we could have prevented it instead were drilling for more oil than ever.
Makes me sad, I wanted kids.
Rip civilisation.

4139 2018-11-14 17:28:27 5 days ago "Not have officials appointed to it that accept fossil fuel industry contributions" was NOT brought by Pelosi. 

Now, after that, Pelosi agreed and would be incorporated. 

No need to defend Big Oil, thanks to AOC media focus not even Pelosi is doing it.
4140 2018-11-14 17:28:25 So i was out very early in the morning and decided to have anda pararha at a dhaba, when i checked the paper used for absorbing oil of omelette, it was an account opening form of a bank, Ewww. ++
4141 2018-11-14 17:28:17 Thank you Emily, for being,now,an important part of facing down the money-grabbers using their money to KEEP control. I hope many Republicans are see'g that we have to take care of our Earth and that oil/gas industry,which COULD invest in renewables,need thr pressure to do so
4142 2018-11-14 17:28:11 I’ve been sick all week and then I just found out someone hacked my debit card and spent a shit ton of money on oil in New York? ugh please.
4143 2018-11-14 17:28:04 I just need someone to oil my scalp for me
4144 2018-11-14 17:28:00 @saykallo can’t believe you use palm oil!!! Been using our stock for years and hadn’t realised. Any plans to get rid!?
4145 2018-11-14 17:27:58 what a mood
4146 2018-11-14 17:27:48 The biggest scam working a 9-5 is that the Dr. Office, the bank, the oil change place, EVERYTHING is also only open 9-5. Like da fuk am I supposed to do??????
4147 2018-11-14 17:27:46 If the Dems are trying to find a solution that keeps their Big Oil Donors whole and happy, then we’re dead. Full stop!
4148 2018-11-14 17:27:20 The article also states that Greenpeace is a 'political campaigning organisation', without justifying how this is so, or, if you demonstrate that, why raising awareness of forest loss via palm oil is problematic - and political.

4150 2018-11-14 17:27:14 Yup. The Permian Basin alone will be adding 100,000s of b/d to US production over the year or so. The forecast for shale supply is quite staggering. That said, most AB oil is heavy and doesn't compete with light shale crude.
4151 2018-11-14 17:27:11 They better hurry up with this damn oil change

4153 2018-11-14 17:27:02 For Calgary to thrive we need pipelines built. Simple. All this looking for diversity of industry is nice but it is ludicrous to ignore the prime industry and expertise. The USA oil & gas is booming while Canada has a self-imposed recession in the energy sector. Pure insanity.
4154 2018-11-14 17:26:59 There is a lag of between 45-60 days on the price of oil  internationally and local pump prices. 
The benefit of the fall in oil  prices will be felt in local pump  prices either in January. 
The price of oil you see quoted in international mkt is normally a future delivery
4155 2018-11-14 17:26:57 let's ask all supermarkets to tell their suppliers to stop using palm oil in any products that they want on their shelves.
4156 2018-11-14 17:26:48 i dont knw much abt food there,whn i cm there i see alot of oil food there.u can eat all bt only little.the food u like most eat only little.

4159 2018-11-14 17:26:24 Oil prices drop as Trump urges OPEC not to cut supply:MORE "PHUX NUDES MEDIA" BULLSHIT ! THE ELECTION IS OVER AND THEY USED THE HI-PRICES FOR ADS AGAINST THE DEMOCRATS, SO NOW IT'S TIME TO BRING THE PRICES BACK DOWN TO REALITY AND THAT'S "STEAL" 4 TIMES TOO HIGH !!
4160 2018-11-14 17:26:17 Ah I see, but aye it still ain't oil down though, peace!
4161 2018-11-14 17:26:13 
4162 2018-11-14 17:26:09 lol more electric cars are being made yet some guy  in a suit behind a computer is saying invest in oil as it has a promising future..
4163 2018-11-14 17:26:00 The two prime movers that have done more for the cause of globalization than any other: the diesel engine and the jet turbine, both get their fuels from oil.  “Clean electricity” doesn’t run the military, airports, cruise liners, supertankers, ports, and transportation industries
4164 2018-11-14 17:25:57 I have. It repeatedly refers to a 'boycott', whereas Iceland clearly state at the end that they are avoiding oil palm UNTIL it can be shown to be deforestation-free. We know that some @RSPOtweets growers have failed in this regard - so no guarantee.

4166 2018-11-14 17:25:46 E.g. RU was kicked out of G8 so yes,there was some isolation.But its banks were not kicked out of SWIFT,its gas and oil exports were not targeted etc. Important to have realistic expectations ab. t/sanctions,their purposes& impact. Goals of t/ new US sanctions are less clear
4167 2018-11-14 17:25:44 Erm....Thanks
*how much of that cannabis oil has he sniffed?
4168 2018-11-14 17:25:41 GOP strength is good policy that grows economy & opportunity. Dems will ALWAYS win on packaging snake oil-- hope & change, save the planet, save the world, save the poor, etc.
4169 2018-11-14 17:25:31 I still just use coconut oil most of the time.
4170 2018-11-14 17:25:30 That doesn't sound right. A new filter is part of an oil change. Find a good mechanic, someone that everyone at the station uses.

4175 2018-11-14 17:25:21 Scottish exports are very strong whisky, agricultural products, beef and lamb, oil, etc etc
4176 2018-11-14 17:25:20 So how much oil money is going into his pocket?
4177 2018-11-14 17:25:16 Talks of death cross in $IWM.  $AAPL entering a bear market and breaking 200 day.  Oil market collapsing.  All of this bearish sentiment really being expressed today.  And yet I find the price action of stocks to be constructive overall today.
4178 2018-11-14 17:25:13 Tirador naman ng chicken oil
4179 2018-11-14 17:24:57 I got an oil change today and learned that bees have been making a hive in my air filter...??? So now I’m torn between being like SAVE THE BEES OUR PLANET IS DYING and being like THE FUCK GET OUT MY CAR YOU STINGY BASTARDS.
4180 2018-11-14 17:24:49 Trudeau's entire fortune comes from oil & gas. I don't dislike electric vehicles at all. Doesn't change my point. If change for no reason makes you less competitive you don't do it.
4181 2018-11-14 17:24:47 Last month I was listening to segments where people from an oil booming town were praising the president and expecting years of prosperity and high oil revenues. Lulz
4182 2018-11-14 17:24:43 Butter and oil, but not too much. Turn occasionally.

4184 2018-11-14 17:24:35 Oh and what of the Harper Gov't not building pipelines? How come they get a pass when they did diddly squat for the oil industry? Harper nixed a 4 billion refinery to clean bitumen so why is Trudeau getting blamed for past failures of previous Gov't? #CDNPOLI

4188 2018-11-14 17:23:45 Many 'experts' have called for $100 oil barrel. The reality is we are in a cheap energy era- innovation enabled.
Difference between companies going forward will be those who view themselves as Oil&Gas Co or an Energy Co.

US energy sector is 15% of BBB & high yield bonds.

4189 2018-11-14 17:23:45 By your own admission the Scottish government took on problems , did they just appear overnight? no  they didn't. They are a result of Scotland being treated as a colony and cash cow for the entire time we have been in the union. £1trillion worth of Scottish oil and rising gone.
4190 2018-11-14 17:23:43 It is certainly sad that Israel is being used as geopolitical standpoint for Western oil and gas interests and resulting military bullshit. Sad indeed for the whole of the Middle East, an area where no leader may forget oil and gas interests of the West.

For your kind information Oil Prices today rose towards $67 per barrel after OPEC and its partners began discussing a proposal to cut output by up to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), a larger figure than officials have mentioned. #NoMoreLies #Pakistan #OPEC

4203 2018-11-14 17:22:59 Mining the oil sands and the reclamation of those sites is the most economic and environmentally positive thing we could possibly do.
4204 2018-11-14 17:22:57 You need to stop this nonsense. The argument you make  by implication is that we therefore carry on exploiting palm oil and thereby destroying the rainforests. The answer is about consuming less and not exploiting resources that are not necessary.
4205 2018-11-14 17:22:38 Lets go oil..... 58s

4208 2018-11-14 17:22:15 Venezuela do have underline issues with the USA and we cant ignore that. They cant sell their oil, at the moment medicine blockage is also enforce by USA. 

We cant take income from a household and accuse the parent of starving the kids.
4209 2018-11-14 17:22:08 Are you suggesting the US should allow Iran to occupy Yemen? Control oil choke points? Allowing Iran to become even more dangerous?
4210 2018-11-14 17:21:57 Do you know that beef is more responsible for deforestation that any other source? Palm oil is least responsible for deforestation than any other oil? Why not going after soybean that has more deforestation than palm oil? Maybe it’s more cultivated in the west.
4211 2018-11-14 17:21:55 I’m saying they aren’t going to effect the Ozone. It’s a different mechanism. And it won’t effect the global environment anymore than that coal fire in Canada which has been burning for at least 500 years or the oil seeps in the Gulf which leak more oil than we’ve ever spilled.

4235 2018-11-14 17:19:42 I think the Kitniyot ruling from conservative rabbis a few years ago, if adopted widely, could drive a giant hole through the Kosher food industry. If we can eat soybean oil and corn syrup on Passover, so, so many of their products no longer need to exist.

Or, we won’t price carbon; in which case markets will descend into chaos in the inevitable #ClimateBreakdown

Therefore we require urgent action to ensure palm oil is produced more sustainably & that falls to governments, producers & purchasers to drive this change @IUCN

4277 2018-11-14 17:16:26 I honestly did not like the coconut oil one enough to buy it a second time- I actually think I threw it out. This is definitely different, though I would say if your hair isn’t damaged or color treated you may not need it as much? I have long hair that is super lifted

4292 2018-11-14 17:15:11 the point is not to overflow the mind of the audience with this info, but to open their minds to what is happening with palm oil. inevitably this will lead to some audiences looking it up like it or not iceland are doing more than other supermarkets to combat the growing issue.

4302 2018-11-14 17:14:32 This is not the case. Most monopolies are the creation of government intervention into the market. Standard Oil was losing market share by the time it was broken by Anti-trust.

4307 2018-11-14 17:14:13 But PP and oil companies aren’t on the same level at all. One is a for profit business that receives a tax break. One is a supposed non-profit that siphons off the government and returns the favor by donating to political groups who support them.
4308 2018-11-14 17:14:03 Skipped breakfast and coffee cuz I had to take my car for an oil change before work. Work only sells those cold Starbucks coffee energy drinks, and I'm almost desperate enough to see what it tastes like heated up in the microwave...
4309 2018-11-14 17:13:53 The oil biz is historically volatile and prone to employment instability. Now because of shale's short investment cycle & fiscal irresponsibility, employment is even more volatile. Choosing a career in an industry deeply in debt and totally dependent on credit is periled.

4358 2018-11-14 17:09:10 Outsiders can't really understand the terror of people who needs to change career into something else.

4386 2018-11-14 17:07:21 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
4387 2018-11-14 17:07:20 That is a fair point. My problem with some of the bad ones is that you just knew they would be rubbish. The fact we tried to get McKenna from Aberdeen recently still worries me. He has all the mobility of an oil tanker.

4393 2018-11-14 17:06:54 In one post you clearly summarized a  complex 70 year time frame one day after you said you didn’t know a narrative of why low oil prices were bad for stocks because you’re “just a blogger”. GTFO of here.

This was great.
4394 2018-11-14 17:06:53 @oliviabvoz 
I'm really getting nervous about this market. What is the mood on the floor like? I thought for sure with oil prices bouncing and the 10 yr yield stable, stocks would kick higher.
4395 2018-11-14 17:06:48 yeah tea tree on its one was never strong enough for me :(( right now I’m trying a wash AND an oil cuz my skin gets HELLA dry in the winter so I’ll see how that goes 
4396 2018-11-14 17:06:39 Not sure. There’d be enough to go around tbf. And both are snake oil salesmen selling - fundamentally - a delusion you can somehow get better than what’s on the table. Which is what’s been on the table from the beginning.

4398 2018-11-14 17:06:36 What good is oil if water and air are poisoned?

4400 2018-11-14 17:05:53 I’ll bite.

1.) Asphalt is not cement. Asphalt is asphalt.  It’s a mixture of oil and dirt.  Melting point varies, but it will soften in heat - and re-harden when cooled.  Thus the cracking in the pavement.

2.) Heat rises.  This includes burning things.

4406 2018-11-14 17:05:31 Saddam's oil was a critical resource worth more than AMZN.

Again, you don't seem to understand that Podunk County Sheriff's can arrest people and put them in jail for doing things it doesn't like.  It can do this to anyone at AMZN, which has no remotely comparable power.
4407 2018-11-14 17:05:25 Yes sir....  First thing you do... Is to get a good location, close to potential customers,  and you need a oil and gas consultant who will guide you through the whole process of regulatry agency....

4429 2018-11-14 17:03:39 @Deadlyslob is the beard oil used in any quest?
4430 2018-11-14 17:03:37 Hi Catriona. Please be assured that we support the sustainable production of palm oil through organisations such as the RSPO (Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil) and the Retailer Palm Oil Transparency Coalition (RPOTC). - Hannah
4431 2018-11-14 17:03:36 It would do a bit of good to research something before going off bcuz ppl don't like PTI. The supply chain of oil coming from KSA/UAE to the end users takes 6-8 weeks to reflect prices. So this reduction will reflect in due time. AU had already reduced taxes to keep prices low.
4432 2018-11-14 17:03:24 we probably should be more focused on the bond market, oil collapse and whether those two things will infect the stock market leading to a recession...
4433 2018-11-14 17:03:15 Okay
4434 2018-11-14 17:03:13 India is beginning to take an aggressive stance on EV...The only way to reduce oil import and correct fiscal deficit.
4435 2018-11-14 17:03:09 Ah yes, 1973, the year of power cuts, three-day working weeks and the oil crisis. What a magical era.
4436 2018-11-14 17:03:08 You inspire me daily with the words of assurance that God is almighty.
I celebrate you sir,more grace and fresh oil in Jesus name....Amen
4437 2018-11-14 17:02:58 here's what i do:
1) buy one cheap bag of goya dry beans and one can of chipotle chilis in adobo
2) on the saute function, add a few glugs of olive oil and a few knobs of garlic, then the chopped up chilis, a spoonful of cumin, 2 bay leaves, and salt
3) rinse the beans
4438 2018-11-14 17:02:56 Yes, and they should be contributing more. They are getting rich off OUR oil. We get 1% royalties & they get given a tax cut. Oh, Yes, and we get the $260billiin cleanup Bill too!
4439 2018-11-14 17:02:53 Haha, oh hush. I'm not that special. Besides, I don't always look good. You should see me when I'm under my car, changing the oil. All grungy and grimy.

4447 2018-11-14 17:02:04 Sadly, decades ago we handed over most responsibility for oil spill detection, containment, and cleanup to the private sector. It would be a huge challenge to bring back capacity.
4448 2018-11-14 17:01:56 Right away 
4449 2018-11-14 17:01:51 Right but it wasn't OUR oil. Saddam just had oil sitting around in the ground. That's not leverage at all.

And I think your aren't really thinking through the leverage Amazon has. What could Podunk Sheriff possibly do to Amazon? Shut down one distribution center?
4450 2018-11-14 17:01:49 We must confront oil & gas drilling in ALL of Colorado! NO MORE WELLS! Frack the fuck out of what is already there and move on to another state!

4455 2018-11-14 17:01:25 I completely agree with @IcelandFoods’ advert to ban palm oil but they sponsor @imacelebrity which involves eating live animals and also using them in trials? #IcelandAdvert #ImACeleb
4456 2018-11-14 17:01:18 There's too much nonsense here to even begin to address in a Twitter post. But if you believe China has a free floating currency, then I can understand why you would think gold isn't money, or nothing of yuan backed oil futures contracts.
4457 2018-11-14 17:01:18 Bollocks this campaign's about palm oil and why Iceland will be removing it.

Should chairity adverts and political broadcasts be banned? 

Stop being a stupid. Just because you see an opinion on TV doesn't mean you have to agree. If you can't help yourself then it's a YOU issue.
4458 2018-11-14 17:01:14 Iceland have removed palm oil from own brand products – apparently replaced with rapeseed and other vegetable oil. The IUCN say alternative crops require up to 9 times more land than palm. Does anyone know if removing palm oil is feasible or are Iceland manipulating us for xmas?
4459 2018-11-14 17:01:11 I was just trolling over the isna page. That religion is bent on stopping oil and gas in America. If they meant well they would be worried about dirty oil from Muslim country’s. Their agenda is obvious
4460 2018-11-14 17:01:04 Can't they spray oil on the bars??
4461 2018-11-14 17:01:00 bruh I posted the palm oil video in my friend group chat and NOBODY responded to it. I just posted it on my IG and legit like 10 people reposted. Gives me hope dude 
4462 2018-11-14 17:00:52 I can count out Chelsea as I know my team, if you want to believe you can win it, fair enough because you should always hope. Imo I think this is the best ever team premier league team, think they’ll win treble. I know it’s cuz of oil money but that’s football

4475 2018-11-14 17:00:13 Awesome!!!!....coconut oil has been an essential part of Ayurveda treatment for centuries. Coconut oil mixed with the right ingredients always works wonders.

What about the carrier used by Cynthia for her arthiritis pain ?. I am very curious to know that too

4480 2018-11-14 16:59:50 Nancy works with the GOP like oil works with water. Remember when they had to “pass it to see what’s in it,” and what was in it was a steaming pile of ?
4481 2018-11-14 16:59:46 Also, the palm oil found in very popular coffee creamers incl International Delight, Nutella spread
4482 2018-11-14 16:59:44 Except Alberta oil hasn’t been strong for along time and the economy is still growing. That is due to NDP diversification. Unlike the former PC’s and current UCP they don’t want to see our economy tank every time oil does.

4501 2018-11-14 16:58:16 I mean if he's upset about the partisan activity of PP, he should be upset about the partisan activity of the oil companies. The "why should I be forced" statement can be applied to dozens of programs, not just PP

4511 2018-11-14 16:57:12 Love getting sprayed in the face with motor oil
4512 2018-11-14 16:57:05 I believe due to the short #natgas / long #oil trade unwinding, hence it’s not seen as sustainable long term? Thoughts?
4513 2018-11-14 16:56:55 Oui mais on s'insurge contre 40 centimes de hausse du gas oil. Incohérence, égocentrisme, inconséquence...?
4514 2018-11-14 16:56:54 We burn oil for fuel. Our knowledge about energy is infantile.  You are confusing human arrogance for absolute truth.  Human beings have not figured everything out yet.  Not even close.
4515 2018-11-14 16:56:52 Yup. Any time you see “olive oil” or “avocado oil” mayo/spread/whatever they have three or more different types of oil so they can say the good one is first. 34% avo, 33% canola, 33% soybean or some such
4516 2018-11-14 16:56:52 One of the ways of plundering pensioners in #Russia is the annual flow of smuggling of oil products to Germany for more than $2bill, without let or hindrance carried out by corrupt officials ofthe #German MinistryofTransport with the tacit consent of the #Putin
4517 2018-11-14 16:56:49 ale z 60$ oil trafili :))
4518 2018-11-14 16:56:41 I really do they still have them at most reservations... It was such a good way to also meet mechanics. Have your oil and windshield washer checked. Now a days it's rush rush rush
4519 2018-11-14 16:56:39 Oil production is being cut all across the board. BUT HEY, we OWN a #pipeline @JustinTrudeau #NOTMYPM @MikeHudema #STOPKM @CoastProtectors #ClimateLeadersDontBuildPipelines ESCPECIALLY one that makes no FISCAL sense.

4521 2018-11-14 16:56:28 < boycott any company selling meat or dairy because animals farmed 4 food are a worldwide plague, I boycott anything with palm oil because of rainforest destruction. I boycott all oil companies because of air/water/soil pollution
4522 2018-11-14 16:56:28 Once U understand he doesn't call the shots, or make any of the decisions & that they only got him elected b/c they knew they had full control over him, everything makes sense. The CABAL now control our OIL, our TAX DOLLARS, our Charter of RIGHTS, & Parliament. Hes their eyecandy
4523 2018-11-14 16:56:27 oil  yes
4524 2018-11-14 16:56:26 By us I mean big business and the 1% who controls everything like climate change policies and oil businesses and farming cows and shit (so really not me & you)
4525 2018-11-14 16:56:24 Wow. My blood pressure dropped. Like the price of oil.
4526 2018-11-14 16:56:22 #ParentPost: 5yr old son had me scratching his ass (due to eczema brkout) for about 30 minutes last night while screaming..."put some oil on it dad".

4528 2018-11-14 16:55:55 Might wanna ask George W. Bush why his own ranch was his legacy missed.  He uses reclaimed water.  Dumb by oil.
4529 2018-11-14 16:55:51 "Even environmental NGOs don't understand" how Alberta's oil industry is environmentally stringent.
4530 2018-11-14 16:55:50 haven't had pasta in a minute, so I'll have to go with angel hair pasta draped with some olive oil, garlic, some Parmesean cheese and parsley flakes, mixed in with broccoli pieces #nomnom  #straightfrommykitchen
4531 2018-11-14 16:55:48 I would prefer we had a prudent County Council rather than one which borrowed up to the hilt to appease.  Like all budgets from household to national, savings have to be addressed unless you are an oil rich country.  Hard calls always have to be made
4532 2018-11-14 16:55:42 @are_you__sure quietly avocado oil prices has steadily risen over the past THREE fiscal years and yet the AVO-farmering lobby continues to demand higher tariffs! #spreadtheguac #privatization

"lo que ocurre en el México actual tiene resonancia con facetas  importantes de la transición española que tuvo lugar tras el fin de la  dictadura franquista"
¡vaya propaganda!

4540 2018-11-14 16:55:06 Yekini Nabena you mean there is no stealing of crude oil now? Then you must be living in another world. Corruption in oil industry is higher than Jonathan era even with PMB as the Minister of Petroleum. God help us we would vote wisely.

4542 2018-11-14 16:54:58 This is so f*cked. The reason you would eat avocado oil based foods is to avoid to Vegetable/Soy oil. Sneak that shit right in there. Trying to fake out the masses any way they can.
4543 2018-11-14 16:54:57 On 114 going towards GV. 18 Wheeler spilled diesel oil causing them to close 161 and backing up 114 for 3 hours  I JUST made it to work LOL
4544 2018-11-14 16:54:53 So #oil prices fell to 65 , what did the  #government and public money burning bureaucrats do - did they hedge enough barrels and product to keep fuel costs low ? Or will they blame #opec and the #restoftheworld as usual ?

4549 2018-11-14 16:54:20 Embarrassing Nadine. One is an attack on someone using their gender as the only basis, the other an attack on values and competence. One is vile, the other valid. Comparing @mrjamesob here to @afneil is completely flawed and you're merely pouring oil on the already raging flames
4550 2018-11-14 16:54:13 Hi David, thanks for your interest and concern. We’re passionate about pledging palm oil free on our own label products, but this is just the start. We’re speaking to all of our branded suppliers too and encouraging them to make the change too! Thanks, Pippa

4554 2018-11-14 16:53:42 Two things people love to do is drive and spend money, and interest rates going up and oil possibly going up this will certainly slow thing down
4555 2018-11-14 16:53:39 Love our oil and gas industry. I also respect the will of the voters and hope Rep Horn is successful in moving our state forward. Good luck to Mayor Holt too.

I have a thyroid disorder that makes it very difficult for me to gain or retain weight, esp if I get even a tiny amount of exercise 
It's a blessing and a curse bc I get called olive oil like, a lot. Ah well
4568 2018-11-14 16:52:33 Woke up to a call for “Bertha Munoz”. 
So I acted like Ms.Bertha, ended up talking to a rep about coconut oil for about 10min in a high pitched voice.
4569 2018-11-14 16:52:32 I thought a lower dollar $DXY and higher #oil were supposed to be a good thing for the market.  Seems like a sell everything type of day.  Also feels like the narrative changes on a daily basis.

4574 2018-11-14 16:52:05 but we believe its progress has been too slow to address the widespread issues around palm oil production. The only way to really tackle these problems is to limit the palm oil demand. Thanks, Pippa 2/2

4577 2018-11-14 16:51:54 I'm pissed.

Congrats #yyc. You've gone from a can-do to a can't do city. It's taken you 40 yrs, but you did it.

You continue to wallow in self-pity over low oil prices, blaming everyone from Notely to Trudeau to Nenshi & not accepting that the glory days...1/11 #yycvotes #ableg
4578 2018-11-14 16:51:53 Hi there, we’re putting an end to the use of palm oil as an ingredient in our own label products by the end of the 2018. We have considered sustainable palm oil and recognise that the movement is working in good faith, 1/2

4583 2018-11-14 16:51:18 Iron Bridge just gave us the most unprofessional experience we have ever had over a Groupon! Refusing service saying the Mercedes Benz dealer charges $130 for a oil change and she can't afford to do it with a Groupon. What happened to customer satisfaction, false advertising.
4584 2018-11-14 16:51:17 we the ppl r happy that we r now energy-independent. oil is no longer a concern or factor when we make our national interests-decisions. obama is a good person, but his legacy was inept n weak-leadership, n 8 yrs of pain n suffering w/chronic stagnant economy.
4585 2018-11-14 16:51:08 Thank you! I do too-I’m trying to get them to handle winter with a looooot of oil lol

4591 2018-11-14 16:50:46 Bad idea: To store value something has to be rare. If you use easily accessible energy to store value then you give the incentive to make it rare. Thats like having a monopoly on oil and going to war to keep it. We should be able to learn from this.

 Line 3 replacement in question
 backlog in rail shipments
 WCS trading at a record discount to WTI
 Production cutbacks and deferred drilling programs
4604 2018-11-14 16:49:53 The lack of inflation? Lack of aggregate demand and absence of labour bargaining power. And oil prices are falling now as well.
4605 2018-11-14 16:49:38 Hopefully are on scene The Republicans are........ Oil prices should be much lower based on supply It’s a vote to keep your families safe & to keep criminals and charges big Tariffs whereas the U.S It’s all the Trump magic - Trump is the magic man Likewise Likewise Very
4606 2018-11-14 16:49:35 And the other pipeline stalled in America. We can't send our oil in any direction!

4609 2018-11-14 16:49:15 Be bold and stop selling oil for 100’s of years. Disrupt the conservative oil business instead of image making.
4610 2018-11-14 16:49:14 Not sure why economics are a concern Tzeporah.  If it's really about the environment, Canada's oil should be produced first, not last.  Why squeeze out Canada's oil to produce Nigerian oil?  Why force it to be shipped to market by rail?

4613 2018-11-14 16:48:50 Oil Prices today rose towards $67 per barrel after OPEC and its partners began discussing a proposal to cut output by up to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), a larger figure than officials have mentioned previously. @ImranKhanPTI @PTIofficial @Imtyspeaks @pid_gov

4616 2018-11-14 16:48:13 Those are facts.  The other fact is we cannot and sounds like will not in the conceivable future export Alberta Oil other than to the States.  We need a plan B.  What about Agriculture becoming a primary focus moving forward?

4619 2018-11-14 16:47:55 I guess the stories of people getting pumped with car oil wasnt enough to scare you off. Same goes for people who still travel there, I guess human heads being rolled in the lobby, abductions, the US Govt warning you for two decades to stay away isnt enough either.
4620 2018-11-14 16:47:54 It was obvious from go what she was doing by getting pregnant by him, I mean really, (Strip Club) Oil and (Figi) Water just doesn’t mix! No offense to anyone’s profession

oil leaks do help chemical companies make money
4623 2018-11-14 16:47:45 Wow. What is the thinking behind this? Once the earth is destroyed, at least we'll have palm oil?!! We must do better than this. #ReadLabels #ActAccordingly

4629 2018-11-14 16:47:14 Palm oil inside eru be used to prevent vitamin A deficiency, cancer, brain disease, aging and treating malaria, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and cyanide poisoning. It be used for weight loss and increasing body metabolism.
4630 2018-11-14 16:47:06 My hair has grown a whole bunch after bleaching and all I’ve been using is tea tree and herbal oil water and eco gel. No conditioner no leave in conditioner no cream moisturizers, basically nothing. Also self trimming my ends 3 months.
4631 2018-11-14 16:47:01 So the question arises, how do we stop Canada from being bullied when the PM and government of this country have been clear that really dont care one bit about the Canadian oil industry. Trudeau was clear, he wants to shut down the "oil sands".

4636 2018-11-14 16:46:34 I come in to get my oil changed so often at this one place that when I walked in this morning, I looked at the waiting crowd and was like "what's the ETA today" and the dude was like "pffft, we'll just do yours right now".

A pretty good way to start the trip.

4644 2018-11-14 16:45:23 That would be the result of world oil prices, actually.
4645 2018-11-14 16:45:21 Yep cheap gas while stocks and oil FALL THROUGH THE FLOOR?  We had that in 1929 ..BUT I think folks then and NOW would rather have strong port folios than extra dollar in their pockets! @LizMacDonaldFOX
4646 2018-11-14 16:45:18 Obviously a good day as Oil BUY is profitable and safe.
Big news is the BTC dropped past 6200, 6000 and 5800 support now resistance.  Next support levels 5555, 5000 & 4500.
At 4500 some original buyers of Bitcoin will finally sell the rest will at 2500 & 1000 or just cry.
4647 2018-11-14 16:45:15 Waiting an hr for my oil change because my ass didn’t stop my errands before hand like I told myself

4653 2018-11-14 16:45:01 Cut,  rest in olive oil, drain, High heat (300c),
4654 2018-11-14 16:45:00 Friendly reminder: Due to the Veteran's Day holiday in the US, the weekly EIA Crude Oil Inventory report is delayed to tomorrow.
4655 2018-11-14 16:44:57 Crude oil futures for December delivery dropped on Monday marking the 11th consecutive daily decline, the longest streak on record according to Dow Jones Market Data going back to 1983.
4656 2018-11-14 16:44:55 To this greater @spekulation string, where's your outrage for all of the companies you hand your money & your lives over to daily? Unless you don't do biz with big oil, big pharma, big agriculture, big insurance, big banking, etc.. you're a hypocrite. They own your government.
4657 2018-11-14 16:44:53 do u know where to get myrtle oil? :)
4658 2018-11-14 16:44:52 @realDonaldTrump Maxine Waters is taking the banks down now. We lost drugs that's to you and social media tech thanks to everyone, and your OIL comments destroyed that sector. let's not even mention traiffs.

dem's want you OUT

There's not much left. this is how CRASHES START
4659 2018-11-14 16:44:51 I was in a town in Sk with my kids that were playing on a brand new playground. The sign next to it showed who all donated money to it, mostly oil and gas companies. I didn’t see where Greenpeace made any donations but you won’t find that with them anywhere for anything.
4660 2018-11-14 16:44:48 @silverxchains next time you wanna our coconut oil in ya hair you might wanna rethink it.
4661 2018-11-14 16:44:48 ㅋㅋ태왕님..인간 외의 것들한텐 박해서 장승 까는거 너무 웃김
4662 2018-11-14 16:44:46 preying on kids enjoying a game to recruit them to kill over rich peoples' oil quarrels. nice
4663 2018-11-14 16:44:43 It’s getting a tune up? An oil change?
4664 2018-11-14 16:44:42 Brent crude oil, the benchmark for global oil prices, lost 6.6% to settle at $65.47 a barrel on Tuesday- it is now down 20% since its recent high.

4666 2018-11-14 16:44:42 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
4667 2018-11-14 16:44:34 Mercury rx already took my car door sensor, oil sensor, 3 computers in my office, and one text message that kind of fucked me up a lil. But LOL, I don’t even get mad anymore. It’s so entertaining

4669 2018-11-14 16:44:30 I'm currently not advising ANY token nor any ICO, DYOR and don't believe snake oil salesmen
4670 2018-11-14 16:43:47 First off, thank you.  

Secondly, oil slick hair like that takes fucking forever to do.  Just getting my hair, when I had it long, died one colour? It was about 2-3 hours work.  And that was just for a pink or blue.  Imagine the time for hers.
4671 2018-11-14 16:43:44 Hows' THAT working for us in #Canada?

We cannot even stop ONE madman in Ottawa.

We can't stop selling our oil for 30% of market price.

We are handicapped by our inability to expose & shut down lies.

Canadjun Injuns CAN be our best ALLIES against globalist dishonesty.
4672 2018-11-14 16:43:25 Quick note: no such thing as Canadian oil. The moment it leaves the ground it's privately owned, mostly by American firms. We have no state oil company, as the Saudis do.
4673 2018-11-14 16:43:24 EMBROIDERY. NEEDLE FELTING. POTTERY PAINTING. ARM KNITTING. OIL PAINTINGGGGG 
4674 2018-11-14 16:43:18 @MbSofKSA DEAR SALMAN THANKS FOR SENDING FIRST PHASE MONEY &amp; OIL TO PAKISTANWHICH U PROMISED DURING IK VISIT TO KSA 
4675 2018-11-14 16:43:13 I don’t normally tweet this much. I’m actually not on the can but I’m getting the oil changed in my car!
4676 2018-11-14 16:43:12 fuck or oil changes. I could think of a billion other things I would rather spend 50 bucks on. Like hookers.
4677 2018-11-14 16:43:12 I can understand more for a small city with less economy of scale. What about AL cans which have higher value but not enough. Guess overall cost of program prohibitive. Sad it's cheaper to landfill materials made from finite oil. We'll be mining landfills in near future.
4678 2018-11-14 16:43:10 Saddam had trillions in oil.  It booted him nothing in 1991 or 2003.

AMZN is a helpless behemoth before even the Podunk County's Sheriff's office.  If they attempted to "crash critical infrastructure" the rebellion would last an afternoon at most.
4679 2018-11-14 16:43:04 I bought an essential oil diffuser. Please laugh
4680 2018-11-14 16:43:03 
They could use sustainable palm oil... nae excuses 
4681 2018-11-14 16:42:58 Not that this is my specialist subject BUT sainsbury especially also claim to be 100% sustainable palm oil.  Had to phone headquarters for that info.
4682 2018-11-14 16:42:55 A small oil by Jay DeFeo (such as Mirage) and a large one by Joan Mitchell (and a bigger house to fit it in).
4683 2018-11-14 16:42:50 Ogbeni @ogundamisi how market? 
He who wears white garments must avoid romance with those carrying palm oil
4684 2018-11-14 16:42:46 My hair is just growing ... thankful for this wild growth hair oil! It feels thicker and healthier

4689 2018-11-14 16:42:25 Canadian oil is $17US a barrel. Where is our PM? 
Oh right. 
He’s in China trying to make a deal to get an appointment make a deal
I’m pretty sure they know he’s an idiot
4690 2018-11-14 16:42:23 Amazing Grace
4691 2018-11-14 16:42:10 We can make our own oil, and there are other places to buy it
4692 2018-11-14 16:41:59 I need a car wash & a oil change 
4693 2018-11-14 16:41:52 وزيركم استقال من فرط شعوره بالذل بسبب هزيمته من المقاومة . 
4694 2018-11-14 16:41:44 Wizzum and chasm said the scratch to the glass a Grissom he rose all perplexed - this guys remembers the oil. On iz plane, tont nose our world with attempts - knows reign undercover - Bella anna all a fumble with the wand - the tears could be read backwards.
4695 2018-11-14 16:41:40 Which tv series u downloading
4696 2018-11-14 16:41:35 Beautiful oil paintings.
4697 2018-11-14 16:41:31 My very first gig was doing weekend news and dj shifts at a country radio station in Holdenville during the late 1980s when the oil bust made the job landscape brutal for getting any sort of practical experience. Sophomore year for that. Worked at the Edmond Sun my senior year.
4698 2018-11-14 16:41:26 WTI oil at $56.29/barrel, +0.60.
4699 2018-11-14 16:41:22 Oil companies make record profits. Taxpayer subsidies to them amount to Billions of dollars. Why am I forced to fund them with my money?
4700 2018-11-14 16:41:08 I think my beard has gotten to the point where I need to invest in beard oil
4701 2018-11-14 16:40:55 New tires and a Oil Change? Goodness 
4702 2018-11-14 16:40:55 I’m not surprised... Republicans will throw their Mama off a goddamn cliff to stay in office....freeloading on taxpayers dollars and  the best healthcare they don’t want others to have...Marco Rubio is as slick as a can of oil.... don’t believe shit he says!
4703 2018-11-14 16:40:54 I will gladly marry her
4704 2018-11-14 16:40:44 I have the idea that hydrogen sulfide can be separated and hydrogen be used in electric cars and fuel blending now that we got oil and export to European countries!!!
4705 2018-11-14 16:40:42 The mechanic at times do a bad job I hv to change the whole of my Vitz engine coz a mechanic messed up wn he was replacing the engine seal now I need $1400 coz I ddnt want oil leaks 
4706 2018-11-14 16:40:42 Yeah, your shite outchea tasting like motor oil, bro, and you expecting your woman to swallow. Tuh. That is on you.
4707 2018-11-14 16:40:31 I don't think they're planning an oil pipeline through your yard.
4708 2018-11-14 16:40:29 Adto sa may maa sa ALESI kanang naay planta sa palm oil
4709 2018-11-14 16:40:27 Only problem in this region is that they all have been fighting for land over 3000 years why would it change now? what made it worse was the colonial nations carved up these regions for their political gains, to the point of creating their own silk road and the war for oil.
4710 2018-11-14 16:40:21 Re Alberta’s so called “Leading Canada” in Economic Growth 
0 x 1 equals a 100’/. Growth LoL
Once again politicians playing with numbers!
Get working on a Pipeline 
East so Ont & Que will buy  Oil & stop buying from USA, Killer Saudi Sheiks & Venezuela’s killer dictator. 
No BS
4711 2018-11-14 16:40:19 Why am I forced to subsidize oil and coal when they're dying industries killing the planet?
4712 2018-11-14 16:40:19 Me thinks Trump and culture are like oil and water - they don't mix. Also, Trump would not be the center of attention so why bother. Worse yet, he might be seated next to Oprah!
4713 2018-11-14 16:40:15 Amber attracts all things to it but garden-basil, and things smeared with oil, between which there is a natural antipathy.
4714 2018-11-14 16:40:11 My dad had an 60’s something Plymouth Valiant that had one. Leaked oil like a well in Houston 
4715 2018-11-14 16:40:05 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
4716 2018-11-14 16:40:03 Note that "the IEA was initially designed to help countries co-ordinate a collective response to major disruptions in the supply of oil." So they have a bit of an institutional bias. And they aren't being asked to bet on these predictions.
4717 2018-11-14 16:39:52 Diapers were an amazing deal at Sam's. When I was making soap, I'd get my big jugs of olive oil there. I get my mailers, tape, and ink jet cartridges there now. That way, we can write the membership off as a business expense, as well.
4718 2018-11-14 16:39:50 I think the more CNY gains influence over global physical flows, the more it will force the US to decide if it wants a shale sector or cheap gold.  At $1200 gold, oil will likely stay low.
4719 2018-11-14 16:39:48 Pue sí, Calderón empezó el mayor genocidio que ha vivido este país desde la Revolución.
4720 2018-11-14 16:39:42 Ever been curious what 300 spark plugs looks like or 500 quarts of oil?? Shopping around to save you money!
4721 2018-11-14 16:39:41 Ok
4722 2018-11-14 16:39:41 you better believe I'm fixing an oil leak with flex tape.

4727 2018-11-14 16:39:18 I pay a lot in taxes. That doesn't bother me. What bothers me is how the money is spent. Corporate handouts, subsidies to oil companies at times of record profits. Bailouts for rich bankers. Pointless wars...

You don't want to contribute to society. Get the fuck out.
4728 2018-11-14 16:39:07 Did my senior design project on this topic and unfortunately it can’t because people don’t care about the deforestation. You only need to deforest a little to produce a lot of palm oil. “Little” being relative to the amount of palm oil produced
4729 2018-11-14 16:39:06 Most people think it's from marijuana. That's why we say CBD Hemp Oil in a lot of our verbiage.

It's actually pretty surprising how many people don't know the difference. Especially when we need to do large B2B transactions.
4730 2018-11-14 16:39:01 Hsbc fund clearcast.

Join the dots.

4736 2018-11-14 16:38:22 Yeah same here I had that one and that’s why I stopped using it lol. It also didn’t hold my oil for more than 3 hours
4737 2018-11-14 16:38:22 It absorbs oil to put off washing it for a day or so.
4738 2018-11-14 16:38:15 The US equity market seems to be crashing as per schedule - India seems to have been spared because of OIL and the RUPEE so far, tomorrow will be interesting!
4739 2018-11-14 16:38:11 Comon norway! Pump those oil money into tesla! I want a factory in the middle of the Swedish and Norwegian border.
4740 2018-11-14 16:38:02 Yes and no. They have threatened to close it multiple times, and any regional conflicts can have a similar effect. Oil is still only one area, we are reliant on alot more. All of which is guaranteed by a strong military.
4741 2018-11-14 16:37:57 Omg I can’t even win lol can’t escape the boxes  ....why do they fuck your hands up like that I wonder?  I’m gonna do the coconut oil before I go back in today. You’re a lifesaver
4742 2018-11-14 16:37:56 Great article!
But it could be a matter of investment priorities.. just knew that Shell abandoned Artic after spending $7 billion! on its failed hunt for oil. What!? That’s a LOT of money...
4743 2018-11-14 16:37:56 iwan ko ang baby oil sa bahay huhu sana di magsugat
4744 2018-11-14 16:37:54 Tbh I would be so much skinnier if no one had ever discovered that food can be cooked in oil
4745 2018-11-14 16:37:49 Make sure you're using a facial oil and moisturizer!! Also neosporin. Unfortunately there's not much more you can do except for wait 
4746 2018-11-14 16:37:46 Plenty of people in NE Scotland care about fishing.  Fair enough, not in Aberdeen any more.  We sold our souls for North Sea Oil long ago, and made it a very rich city indeed.  Not a single trawler out of Aberdeen now.  Sadly.  Plenty others up the Coast though.
4747 2018-11-14 16:37:42 Get this math. Alberta leaves Canada our Alberta oil goes from $15 a barrel to $60 a barrel with the stroke of a pen. This time next year I hope to fly the Stars and Stripes as OUR flag. Cheers Canada I'll drink to that.
4748 2018-11-14 16:37:35 As always even rafeal deal will back fire on congress.instead of questioning the modi govt on development.providing light/road to u.p & other states2..shud ask about inflation,oil price,education , roads 2 bad in u.p..haryana..etc.tax relief to small businesses man &self employed
4749 2018-11-14 16:37:25 Gotta stop using plastic too. Can't have big oil benefitting from the sales of plastics. Unpackaged foods only.
4750 2018-11-14 16:37:14 As long as you remember that “our precious Union” means “lots of barrels of lovely lovely oil”, all will be clear.
4751 2018-11-14 16:37:05 Your piece is completely one-sided. Of course I’m biased too. But did you not stop to think objectively about things like why helping UAE to diversify their assets away from oil by investing abroad in a sustainable way is a route to positive development for a country?
4752 2018-11-14 16:37:03 I religiously follow Ctm, but how can a oil reduce oil from skin?
4753 2018-11-14 16:36:55 Hate yourself
4754 2018-11-14 16:36:52 I really really wanna try this but don’t have a budget yet.  @tatcha_v silk canvas, camelia oil, dewy mist, and water gel for now. Later, I’ll have you  soon, you’ll be mine 
4755 2018-11-14 16:36:52 It's so amazing just how much cbd oil helps
4756 2018-11-14 16:36:50 I’m waiting on my oil change and sitting here in direct sunlight wearing dark colors and there’s nowheres else to sit
4757 2018-11-14 16:36:49 Public debt is operationally unrelated to GDP.
You are an expert. How don't you grasp, Venezuela owed FOREIGN denom debt? Dollars, Euros, Yuan. 1 industry. Vn imports chems & equip. Oil from $140 to $25, well below cost.
Vn *also* spent too much shrunk oil revenue on domestic.
4758 2018-11-14 16:36:46 Smooth talking is a hobby... ogoni people are still asking when the cleaning of their oil spill ravaged lands will commence
4759 2018-11-14 16:36:44 .@IcelandFoods  great work on highlighting the devesatation palm oil is causing to the orangutan's habitat, do you think you could get rang-tang toys in your stores for Christmas with proceeds going to the cause?
4760 2018-11-14 16:36:43 added a tipple of coconut oil to my shea butter to it to make easier to rub down. 

Now it’s cold, and the coconut oil has hardened up, making the shea unusable 
4761 2018-11-14 16:36:42 Someone just wanted to take my photo, I obliged but they only wanted the back of my T-shirt - I know I’m no oil painting, but not sure if to be offended! Lol
4762 2018-11-14 16:36:41 You think oil stays low?
4763 2018-11-14 16:36:37 Gasoline and engine oil and all the plastic and foam and etc. inside a car burn, too. A car is a container of fire fuel waiting for the right circumstances to burn.
4764 2018-11-14 16:36:37 Vegetable oil
4765 2018-11-14 16:36:36 The kid with feet in the case, the kid who tries using their foot to assist with 6th position, and the kid who uses endless amounts of valve oil. Wait, what page are we on? Elementary band, I’ve missed you.
4766 2018-11-14 16:36:35 I say equally terrifying. Neither one has half an ounce of knowledge to run this country. There are consequences when you elect a snake oil salesman and his nude pics on the internet wife.
4767 2018-11-14 16:36:33 Good point, and mustn't forget non-linearities. Oil prices may cause disorder should they fall below certain thresholds. Remember gulf pegs and HY... not there yet though.
4768 2018-11-14 16:36:33 こんな小学生おじさんにオムライス渡しにきてくれる方、いませんか

4771 2018-11-14 16:36:19 But but that’s been oil in the past two weeks!
4772 2018-11-14 16:36:19 St. Denis lived at the house with daughter.... he made most of his money in illicit drugs. Hash oil from Jamaica.
4773 2018-11-14 16:36:14 Saw some bitcoin and crypto talk a couple of days ago. I recall someone posting they were waiting for BTC to go over $7,000 before buying. The community allows brief snippets of crypto, ES, NQ & NG commentary before raging at those participants to get back on message with oil.
4774 2018-11-14 16:36:04 Thread 1/ I’m testifying today at #EPAinCO on efforts to roll back federal methane rules. “@EnvDefenseFund strongly opposes @EPA’s proposal to weaken the 2016 New Source Performance Standards for the oil and gas sector.” #CutMethane
4775 2018-11-14 16:36:00 Na the rts dey vex me. The guy on an oil rig or a coal mine is somehow putting himself ahead of his housewife or teacher wife who is entirely supported by that income
4776 2018-11-14 16:35:55 I really wish CBD makers would stop calling their shit “CBD hemp oil” when it’s actually just CBD oil derived from hemp and has nothing to do with hemp seed oil. You’re muddying the language, you ineloquent  fucks.
4777 2018-11-14 16:35:26 Man I been getting too high I then started back sipping oil 
4778 2018-11-14 16:35:25 That is right.Upto Modi to use the latest gift from Heaven.Oil prices down,rupee stronger.If Modi smart Wil cut oil prices down by RS.5 per liter.But he won’t @Swamy39

4783 2018-11-14 16:35:14 Oil trading @ USD.56 pb !!!! Wow! I expect petroleum prices to lower within coming weeks,.
4784 2018-11-14 16:35:10 @CadburyUK We usually keep some of your chocalate eclair toffees in our car. From now on, we will not be doing so, nor will we buy any other products of yours, until you stop destroying the environment to obtain palm oil.

4786 2018-11-14 16:34:42 The unwinding of speculative positions has been a key driver of the 20% decline in crude oil from its October highs. #OPEC #Commodities

4788 2018-11-14 16:34:36 You know the oil and gas exports are not included in the Scottish figures but are in the UK figures. 

Perhaps you should read the contents of a report and not just the headline
4789 2018-11-14 16:34:32 weird oil; stank of it
4790 2018-11-14 16:34:30 As much as I feel his mother’s pain, he deserves what ever he gets!  Inmates do not like baby killers. How he could kill his pregnant wife and those precious girls and throw their tiny bodies in an oil tank, is beyond disgusting. No sympathy.

4796 2018-11-14 16:34:16 We've had lots of enquiries the last few days following the Iceland advertisement produced by Greenpeace asking whether palm oil is included in the Arden Grange range. We are happy to say - it isn't.
4797 2018-11-14 16:34:06 Homegirl left me a cartridge of thc oil. I might just smoke and sleep all day today
4798 2018-11-14 16:33:56 Chick-fil-A going to start offering tire rotations and oil changes while you wait in line. This service is unmatched.
4799 2018-11-14 16:33:52 Supply and demand dynamics at play, production in the OPEC cartel and U.S. WTI has increased. The strengthening dollar $DXY is another factor. This plunge in crude oil prices is also weighing on energy stocks.

4805 2018-11-14 16:33:23 They don't care about any union they just care about money. Scotlands oil is worth a lot of money so they will find a way of trying to keep us shackled to to their sinking ship
4806 2018-11-14 16:33:20 raise the gas tax a nickel.They don’t have the stones to do it but oil is not going over $120 without a large devaluation of the dollar due to technology. Best way to pay for infrastructure while we can and it doesn’t disporipitionaly hit folks who have to use oil/gas later.
4807 2018-11-14 16:33:18 You’re a fully paid up member of the head-in-the-sand Snats aren’t you. Answer the question (you have another 3 outstanding). How much oil goes through Shetland?

4817 2018-11-14 16:32:05 The brilliance of the Trudeau govenment. Give money to losers like Bombardier and CBC and cripple the lucrative oil and gas sector.  Tax the winners and subsidize the losers.
4818 2018-11-14 16:32:03 If canada had to sell its oil I could understand. But why the fuck dont they just use it for there own country.  I'm just just curious, the price of gas in canada would drop right?

4820 2018-11-14 16:31:48 i think this passes "optimistic" and slips into "deliberate lies".  the EPA eMPG is specifically benchmarked to oil.  they had a sensible measure back in the clinton admin when they put it in.  they changed it for political reasons in direct denial of the actual science.
4821 2018-11-14 16:31:40 I agree. I think it's Koskinen's job to lose now. The Oil wanted a back up that could take the load off Talbot and play more games than backups in the past have and they got it. Hopefully Talbot can get his game back now
4822 2018-11-14 16:31:26 CEOs: Yeah, it's hotter, but these waves of oil sure cool off our fleets of hot-ass engines!

4840 2018-11-14 16:29:59 I expect headline CPI around 2.1-2.3% in November depending on how oil prices evolves through the month. Fed will overlook short term oil price movements and focus on core inflation which is expected to remain around 2%.

4845 2018-11-14 16:29:19 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
4846 2018-11-14 16:29:16 Use dawn dish soap to clean them, then use a non scented lotion w coconut oil or something.

4860 2018-11-14 16:28:01 Medium chain triglyceride... Coconut oil contains mct ... Its a 'healthy fat' (cannabis binds to fats when infusing.. So more thc is extracted when mixed with high fat oils rather than lower fat oils) use the highest fat oils to get the most out of your cannabis 
4861 2018-11-14 16:27:59 Large quantities of edibles did it for me. Last time I tried edibles & oils.

4891 2018-11-14 16:25:51 The price of oil plunged to an eight-month low on Tuesday as traders scrambled to adjust options positions amid fears global economic turbulence would cut into demand. The pressure has been building for some time but traders are deeply divided over the crude price outlook. (FT)
4892 2018-11-14 16:25:49 Why on earth is this man being allowed to air his views?

4913 2018-11-14 16:23:47 This was not a mandate on lowering taxes. Council should continue to balance costs with building a livable city. And they've done a great job considering conservatives didn't manage the boom and bust of the oil patch which has left us a vacant downtown.
4914 2018-11-14 16:23:33 Sure this does go against a lot of teachings. But also Indigenous communities want to be able to reap the economic rewards of the communities and industries. Sometimes the only economy around these communities to enter is the oil industry.

4924 2018-11-14 16:22:59 Juul so damn trash. Idk why ppl puffing it like it’s oil.
4925 2018-11-14 16:22:55 Factoring the cost of fuel considers many things not only VAT alone but also International Oil prices.

4927 2018-11-14 16:22:38 Well, that was a surprise. I just discovered @quicktrip15 doesn’t sell motor oil.
4928 2018-11-14 16:22:37 If mankind can pipeline oil, water is much easier and it won't destroy the farm lands in case of spills........in fact a spill might help stuff grow caled "irrigation".
4929 2018-11-14 16:22:36 If it doesn't have to do with oil, people dont want their gov't spending money on itm
4930 2018-11-14 16:22:34 I slipped on oil in a parking garage while turning once. It's incredible how fast you go down. It's not slow motion in your mind at all. I now ride around all puddles - frozen or not.
4931 2018-11-14 16:22:32 Je a shafama kai
4932 2018-11-14 16:22:23 Not following these closely but as you’ll know oil is -20% since early October. So whether this is catalyst I don’t know. China data have been consistently on soft side too - so this could be reason too
4933 2018-11-14 16:22:22 Yeah. Like the recent Crude Oil debacle? Go Away, Greenspan, you've already caused enough headaches.
4934 2018-11-14 16:22:20 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
4935 2018-11-14 16:22:18 You could nationalize  fossil fuel companies continue to run them to meet demand from existing infrastructure but redirect all profits to invest in renewable energy, building insulation, etc.  The big problem with the oil companies is that use profits to invest in new oil fields.
4936 2018-11-14 16:22:14 When you want to stone stones at b#&*"s. Get that Roman Catholic priest and pour oil on their voodoos.

#annoyed
4937 2018-11-14 16:22:11 Alberta oil is an easy target when you have a Prime Minister thinking he can save the world by shutting down Canada’s oil industry & importing it from AK-47 countries. 
4938 2018-11-14 16:22:04 The image of seabirds drowning in oil — a 20th Century image of ecological devastation — once again conflates the past and the future in the narrative present of the film. #pandaeunium
4939 2018-11-14 16:22:00 Because you’re conflating Indigenous activism with environmental activism. 

Indigenous peoples want control over resources this doesn’t inherently = banning oil investment.
4940 2018-11-14 16:21:53 omg tru i thought you meant like a tolerance think. but bby tea is better for u anyway! and b12 gives u nrg! and cbd oil is a thing!
4941 2018-11-14 16:21:43 Looks like a game of Hide and seek. 
And they laugh at you in the bushes Adrian.
You can come out now Vonk !

4943 2018-11-14 16:21:30 When people ask me "Nina, what's that you're putting in your coffee?" I don't think they ever expect "It's straight oil that I put in a recycled fish sauce bottle to pour more easily"
4944 2018-11-14 16:21:29 Oui ou fermé...je ne suis pas spécialisé je reprends des stats générales simplement pour souligner qu'il n'y a pas que le gaz oil qui pollue mais on n'en parle pas
4945 2018-11-14 16:21:25 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
4946 2018-11-14 16:21:23 2/7 understand a little. Waa must i burn midnight oil hmm.
4947 2018-11-14 16:21:19 Cara ampuh agar rambut tidak kering setelah memakai selsun:

4948 2018-11-14 16:21:14 I've never had the oil but I've heard good things. I use a vape pen made for green. Two of those and forget it, I'm gone. Great for when I want to escape into VR when everyone's in bed for the night.
4949 2018-11-14 16:21:07 Close oil

4951 2018-11-14 16:20:59 JR was on the 14/15 team

And I'm thinking it was because he was old and sharing a starting lineup with Jose Calderon and Andrea Bargnani's pasta linguini fucking Italian Meatball ravioli fuckass full of fucking olive oil fucking fingers
4952 2018-11-14 16:20:51 Secondary oil uses constitute 98% of everything you come in contact with in daily life.  They are the furthest thing from "infinitesimal"   They allow you to exist.
4953 2018-11-14 16:20:46 Fuck you & your Palm oil.
4954 2018-11-14 16:20:36 We are not drilling enough oil yo account fir 80% of the world’s needs. That is a flat out lie.

And we’re not saving for future so better get those solar & wind farms running!
4955 2018-11-14 16:20:22 I’m not a big mayo person but If I need it for something I crack an egg into a mason jar with some salt and a splash of vinegar, stick in an immersion blender and drizzle in macadamia/avocado/light olive oil until the texture is right. Idiot proof!
4956 2018-11-14 16:20:18 Girl Go get your damn oil changed wth 
4957 2018-11-14 16:20:16 It's time the multi millionaires and billionaires to come together to solve this issue. TY alone made $10b from sale of part of an oil bloc
4958 2018-11-14 16:20:12 I also make my own body products. From coconut oil and essential oils. My own deodorant and toothpaste. When I used the commercial products and fluoride toothpaste, I had mouth sores and dry mouth in morning. No longer. I also have perfectly healthy gums and no cavities.
4959 2018-11-14 16:20:04 If it was all about the environment, your Liberal government would be pushing through legislation to get Canadian Oil and Gas to international markets.  It is developed and produced to the highest environmental and regulatory standards in the world not like other jurisdictions.
4960 2018-11-14 16:19:46 The funniest part about the oil sands is they have proclaimed parts of it and it's used as farmland. Went from tar Sands to farmland
4961 2018-11-14 16:19:45 Full tank and newly changed oil and now I'm broke what is life?
4962 2018-11-14 16:19:40 Definitely a body oil & wine night tonight.

Seats are vibrating and making noises and causing inconvenience ,also the sheets provided are dirty and has oil stains.
4965 2018-11-14 16:19:35 Thank you have Signed there is indeed no such thing as #RSPO bearing in mind an Orangutan was shot, skinned and eaten last year when supposedly trespassing on a #RSPO plantation we don't need palm oil period!
4966 2018-11-14 16:19:31 Considering it has all that oil, Scotland should be a very wealthy nation, shouldn’t it?
4967 2018-11-14 16:19:31 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to DROP ALEC [link to graphic]
4968 2018-11-14 16:19:22 of all the smells, why tf does this bathroom smell like olive oil?!
4969 2018-11-14 16:19:10 Well, there are nowhere near enough 117s to handle the demand that is for sure. They have to use the CPC1232's or there is no industry. I have also seen issue about locomotives and that also is 1 of the things that the Albertan govt is asking for in its oil-by-rail govt handout.
4970 2018-11-14 16:19:09 Unfortunately we figured out how to increase extraction rates and the overall areas which can be exploited. BTW no one with any credibility says we will ever run out of oil. We will run out of >economic< oil someday, if we live that long.
4971 2018-11-14 16:19:02 these fuckin dawn dish soap commercials with the baby duck covered in oil caused me to have an emotional breakdown this morning. currently sitting on my couch crying over the shit. that’s where we’re at lmao.

4975 2018-11-14 16:18:40 Oil rose on Wednesday amid reports that OPEC members are discussing a proposal to cut output by up to 1.4 million bpd, much more than the figure already released about output cut to take effect from next month. The OPEC oil was traded at $67 to the barrel. Reuters/IRNA
4976 2018-11-14 16:18:39 will Tory Scottish Sec @DavidMundellDCT have some guts & resign as it's clear #EU want to plunder our fish stocks - though they don't see to be offering free access to French coal reserves, Czech iron ore, Romanian oil, Italian grapes or Spanish olive oil in return. Oversight?
4977 2018-11-14 16:18:32 Do not forget, only about 40% of our energy is now oil produces as the green movement gets bigger and bigger.
4978 2018-11-14 16:18:26 @elonmusk I was thinking if we can build a oil  pipeline across thousands of miles ,why can't we build one from the ocean to the hills and valleys of California .so when  fires start we can open them up and soak  the land like a giant sprinkler hose? I thought if anyone can  you
4979 2018-11-14 16:18:23 Well she didn’t oil up and spread eagle on a fur rug for money....
4980 2018-11-14 16:18:23 Oil looks like it’s gains are going to roll over. This is crazy
4981 2018-11-14 16:18:21 I feel like it's one of my fridge and held me at gun point, asking where the oil
4982 2018-11-14 16:18:16 Who the hell cares..he murdered his pregnant wife and little girls and put their bodies in oil drums... don’t waste our time running stories like this
4983 2018-11-14 16:18:07 Yo sólo quemo queroseno...
Los que consumís gasolina y gas oil sois todos unos fascistas
4984 2018-11-14 16:17:58 yeah if men didnt do those jobs they wouldnt exist. are woman going to build a skyscraper or go work on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean? no they wont. if men didnt work those jobs our society and the way we live would be entirely different.

4986 2018-11-14 16:17:48 I won't be buying chocolate made @CadburyUK for myself, children or grandchildren while palm oil is an ingredient.

4988 2018-11-14 16:17:38 Morgan is a pundit that make criticisms, big up to Iceland for highlighting the fallacy of palm oil productions.

4990 2018-11-14 16:17:28 In our work designing marine oil spill expert systems, we found that experts typically select the response option they think is most likely to work. If that fails they go to the next option on the list. Or, they apply all options, hoping one or more stick. @edbutler2 @ManuelaBBC

4992 2018-11-14 16:17:21 As I've grown older, I've learned the secret to delicious cooking is to buy expensive olive oil and then use as much of it as possible in all your food.
4993 2018-11-14 16:17:18 I grew up eating sharp cheddar cheese melted on cinnamon pop tarts (w/o icing)! Believe it or not! That was before Kellogg's changed their recipe! Now poptarts taste like cardboard doused with cheap oil! For this question, I'd like one of each!
4994 2018-11-14 16:17:14 My 72 year old mom, who has been dealing with lung cancer ...now knows the benefits of cbd/thc oil for her health...and she’s spreading the word with other seniors in her building 
4995 2018-11-14 16:17:14 Any idea on HPCL? can it break the oil curse ?
4996 2018-11-14 16:17:05 Norway has the largest oil extraction per capita.  The @WinnipegNews knows this.
4997 2018-11-14 16:16:53 I just finished reading that FOX News OP-ED that Mitch McConnell wrote and I’m livid. That lying hypocritical Machiavellian snake oil turtle shit stain, is asking for democrats to work with his base instead of playing politics to harass Trump. FUCK YOU Mitch McConnell!

5002 2018-11-14 16:16:35 #IcelandAdvert I don’t get how this is banned for being political. It’s a FACT that palm oil is decimating the population of orangutan - why is it political??
5003 2018-11-14 16:16:32 Crude shock to Crude oil Bulls:
Brent Crude fell more than 7% yesterday.
It was 12th straight day of fall, a record in the Crude History.
Good for India.
5004 2018-11-14 16:16:29 Tell me how much the defense industry and the oil industry spend on lobbying, and tell me how much $$ tax breaks they get. Don't pretend the PP number is some isolated incident.
5005 2018-11-14 16:16:27 Oh and I forgot of course the legendary  Snake Oil 
5006 2018-11-14 16:16:24 Perhaps they should coat that fence with environmentally friendly canola oil. Then we will see how climable it is.

5009 2018-11-14 16:16:09 India’s inflation is going down, even when oil prices are high. Rural consumption in going down. Liquidity in financial markets has become a concern. RBI follows more stringent norms than Basel’s capital adequecy. Govt has all the right to question RBI’s intentions
5010 2018-11-14 16:16:08 Energy shares track oil price rebound
 
Wall St rises and energy stocks fight back; pound volatile as Brexit dominates
5011 2018-11-14 16:15:56 This is crap,,,u are giving our minerals to these people,,now everyone heard about our oil,,they want to partner with us,,u idiots in parliament can't think,,,how do u invest with your banks not having money?it's early for investment fix the mess , before,its clear ure thieves

5014 2018-11-14 16:15:51 I'm confused which company is she is a shill for the ones keeping Canada oil out of Market or the ones trying to get Canada oil to Market?
5015 2018-11-14 16:15:48 Oil
5016 2018-11-14 16:15:35 .@CadburyUK please can we get an official statement from you about your policies and plans on palm oil use? Seeing lots of negative tweets about it and want to hear your side? Thx
5017 2018-11-14 16:15:33 Not good for us in LA.  Oil needs to stay above $55 per barrel.
5018 2018-11-14 16:15:32 I’ll be expecting the explication soon that stocks are down because oil is up lol 
5019 2018-11-14 16:15:23 Hmmmm, let me see...who is paying big bucks to politicians to get laws passed favoring their business and doing the peddling and making billions of dollars selling their own snake oil that harms millions of kids?
5020 2018-11-14 16:15:20 I'm curious how they explain oil's run-up into October, in which momentum traders were long. It would take a pretty short lookback window to explain the first half of the decline (for momentum and trend to switch directions that quickly).

5023 2018-11-14 16:15:12 @DavePratt1040  I'm in the oil business.  I would like to see 7 billion  plowed I into a new pipeline.  Not a 2 week party. Your media.  It helps you  for a couple of months of talk
5024 2018-11-14 16:15:12 So the wheel that makes the most noise gets the most oil? Republicans will have to learn to make a noise and stop treating Democrats like spoiled children.
5025 2018-11-14 16:15:03 I engage in a bit of that now and again for some primo cannabis oil. It's some sweet stuff!

5033 2018-11-14 16:14:05 It really helps but sometimes it makes the tiniest buzzing sound and I’m a super light sleeper so it annoys me. But it’s especially nice if you add a few drops of essential oil into it
5034 2018-11-14 16:14:03 Since oil rolled over in a big way, #CPI will as well in the coming months as higher oil prices roll out of the stats. 4/
5035 2018-11-14 16:14:01 What's the point in May having a cabinet meeting when her bosses the @duponline have knocked the deal back!?  Is there enough money from Scottish oil to bribe the #Dinosaurs?

5037 2018-11-14 16:13:55 Hahaha Hamilton is the new data which is the new oil
5038 2018-11-14 16:13:46 if you use actual figures from transfer of energy from oil to electricity and then measure eMPG for a tesla, it's FAR worse than a prius or even many ICE only cars.

EV's are really heavy and this becomes a big issue.
5039 2018-11-14 16:13:45 Men with fragile masculinity will just never get to experience the sensation of a sweet smelling lip gloss with peppermint oil and they don’t deserve it anyway
5040 2018-11-14 16:13:41 Good question! And I think the answer is no. It’s hidden as #vegetable-oil in many foods. I think it is NOT possible for @IcelandFoods to remove all #PalmOil from their foods. It’s needed for it’s functional properties in so many products. And what is the alternative?  Lard!?
5041 2018-11-14 16:13:28 Perhaps they replaced the butter with palm oil...
5042 2018-11-14 16:13:26 Goes the same with some other local products too ....some people look down their noses at us when we say we grow a single variety rapeseed oil! That's sustainable, local & keeping a farm, other families in work. Looking after environment!
5043 2018-11-14 16:13:21 She’s drying her hair, and the oil smells so nice on her skin… she’s /definitely/ making some.

5049 2018-11-14 16:12:48 US crude oil prices have crashed almost 26% from their peak in October as fear of a shortfall in supply has turned into talk of a glut. They suffered their worst day  on Tuesday, plummeting 7% to a one-year low.

5051 2018-11-14 16:12:33 As we speak the oil Bulls are back. A rising oil with avg export growth is a double whammy. 
OPEC cutting production and 6 months grace for Iran oil makes oil Bulls happy.

5053 2018-11-14 16:12:23 Sippin oil, getting loose
5054 2018-11-14 16:12:20 Or we could stop subsidizing oil, Amazon, and profitable industries in general, and have the rich pay their fair share of the goddamn tax burden.

5059 2018-11-14 16:11:58 Good luck keeping the Lights on in England when Scotland leaves this so called United Kingdom. We will be taking our Electricity,Water,Oil,Renewables,Agriculture, Fishing and Whisky with us. Everything England relies on to stop going Bankrupt.
5060 2018-11-14 16:11:49 You're quite choosy about People's Votes though, aren't you, Chuka? You weren't keen on the one that made Corbyn leader, any more than your BFF Ali Campbell was keen on having one against his Iraq oil atrocity...
5061 2018-11-14 16:11:48 All I want for Christmas is for government officials to stop pretending they do not see the Forte Oil and Dangote trailers weighing down our bridges and causing a public safety issue for the general population.

5063 2018-11-14 16:11:40 Evidentemente el uso de renovables puede ser muy caro, pero cualquier cosa es poco si permite dejar de depender de países cuyos intereses no cuadran con los nuestros. Pero el petróleo se seguirá usando en industria y tal. A ellos casi les conviene reducir barriles ante oil peak.

Instead tell your reasons.
5066 2018-11-14 16:11:28 This is what got Venezuela's "Obama" (Carlos Andrés Pérez) in 1973. Took power Mar74. "Nationalized" crude oil industry Jan76 (already other big operations were ran by gov). The first currency devaluation occurred Feb83 and it all spiraled down from there
He wld be elected again
5067 2018-11-14 16:11:07 WTI will bounce imho but only to go even lower. Sell USD buy CAD now or just wait for the low in Oil, peak USD/CAD. I won't be greedy.

5069 2018-11-14 16:10:55 But a diet approach to reduce palm oil doesn't work as a majority of it goes towards to fuel
5070 2018-11-14 16:10:43 Come on @CadburyUK @CadburyWorld @Ritzcrackers @Oreo Stop with the palm oil! Stop destroying the rain forests for Palm oil plantations! Stop KILLING ORANGUTANS and pushing them to extinction for you can put a few more pennies in you pocket!
Do. The. Right. Thing!
#StopPalmOil
5071 2018-11-14 16:10:34 BLOGGERS!!! Who has some really informative and up to date posts on products, cosmetics, household items that do NOT use ANY palm oil.
I don’t want “sustainable” palm oil because it doesn’t exist.
Zero palm oil, it seems there’s hidden palm oil in foods/products I wasn’t aware of
5072 2018-11-14 16:10:29 Get rid of all the products in your shop that contain palm oil then

5076 2018-11-14 16:10:13 Govt neither increased the prices. it is the oil marketing companies which regulates the prices.  Govt interferes by reducing the taxes. Prices increased due to escalation in international oil prices. the media blamed the govt for fuel price increase.

5082 2018-11-14 16:09:56 @jimcramer there’s already a shortage in Canada. The more they grow, the more they sell whether it be flower, edible, oil, pills. There will never be a supply glut
5083 2018-11-14 16:09:51 I bet all the gurus who have been calling for $55 oil since the end of February missed that entire move they’ve wasted hours tweeting and blogging about all this time 
5084 2018-11-14 16:09:47 Hey @realDonaldTrump so much “winning”.  Saudi Arabia may be about to make oil much more expensive.

5086 2018-11-14 16:09:43 Iceland isn't against palm oil. You still have products in your stores that contains it. It's all very fickle. A great way to get advertising for free. I hope all the money you have saved on TV advertising is being donated to deforestation. Its all very contradictory.
5087 2018-11-14 16:09:38 Absolutely there is ntn wrong. Its just that the dude brain has hibernated

5093 2018-11-14 16:09:17 At the dealership getting my oil changed and one of the service advisors sits down and talks to me about how cute Greyson is. I went on to tell him that it took us 36 hours to name him because naming a boy is so hard.
5094 2018-11-14 16:09:17 I really hope their viewers start to consider what a #GreenNewDeal would mean. From a climate resiliency perspective it means safer air and water when we have fires and floods. Infrastructure with renewables reduces the need for foreign oil and household bills.
5095 2018-11-14 16:09:15 This particular point about Palm oil is a fat lie

5101 2018-11-14 16:08:43 And when will you be removing ALL products that contain non sustainable palm oil from your shelves?
5102 2018-11-14 16:08:41 Besides being lazy, it can be difficult to get rid of old oil. It is like most hazardous chemicals these days. It can be such a pain to get rid of substances that people will leave them in areas where they could become hazards.
5103 2018-11-14 16:08:35 Imagine how much better off Scotland would have been had we rightfully had the revenues from Oil & Gas from our North Sea, we would have had an oil fund rather than a share of the Uk's £1.86 trillion of debt and austerity would have been unknown to us!
5104 2018-11-14 16:08:34 I meant overall. Of course you're right, and I would add that we should work to preference less carbon-intensive oil.
5105 2018-11-14 16:08:30 By the end of the year @IcelandFoods will have stopped using palm oil in their products, hopefully all other major supermarkets take the same action!
5106 2018-11-14 16:08:29 Always warm it up. You never want to drive off with a cold engine. Gotta give the oil time to get out of the pan and all over the parts.

@OJRenick
5115 2018-11-14 16:07:55 i just dealt with this. Secondary oil uses are infinitesimal compared to burning it. You know this. Leave the oil for vaccines and plastics. Stop preventing us from moving away from burning it.

You assholes are suing to prevent California from moving off oil. LEAVE US ALONE.

5117 2018-11-14 16:07:43 Omg I’m so glad you’ve asked this as I really want to know too! I absolutely will NOT support the use of palm oil...Let me know what you find out please beauty 
5118 2018-11-14 16:07:43 The taxpayer is tapped . The key economic driver of Ab oil and gas is being suppressed within  Calgary is surviving but no money for extras . People don’t trust in the budgeting of gov at all levels . Politically unstable in a year from now we may have new premier and PM.
5119 2018-11-14 16:07:37 I’m always interested in talking & having a civil discussion with someone against the oil industry. It opens my eyes up to a lot of the unethical stuff we do as an industry to make a quick buck.

When I go to work, I’m keeping all of this in mind during project implementations.
5120 2018-11-14 16:07:33 That's just it brother. Maybe its for the best for her
5121 2018-11-14 16:07:24 I agree with you about the "sustainable" deforestation free aspect-yet I also would ECHO that there are crops like SOY which can do many of the things they are using PALM OIL for today. We need to stop "FARMING/slaughtering" animals as we do-all the PLANTS/resources they are fed.
5122 2018-11-14 16:07:16 すごい行動力ですね。
これはまだ記事にしていないのですが、もし今後 fish oil を飲まれる予定ならば、サーモン由来のものがあるか探してみると良いかもしれません。鮭のオイルには anti-oxidant が豊富です。

5133 2018-11-14 16:06:45 To clarify, Venezuela govt spent on social assistance, did not reinvest in productive capacity (oil) which led to drastic production declines. Their debt was essentially backed by oil, so now can’t borrow. Japan or US debt backed by economy, markets could also lose confidence.

5148 2018-11-14 16:05:36 OK. Climate change. The earth’s temperature has gone up and down over time. In the last few decades temperatures have risen dramatically. 98% of the world’s scientists agree this is because of greenhouse gases (mainly Co2) created by humans burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas).
5149 2018-11-14 16:05:29 Last I checked, “elsewhere” politicians aren’t above the law but our Democrats are because the media is in on their deception. They’ll just blame Republicans like they do all the time. Democrats are selling you snake oil and you just get in line along with the other lemmings.

5186 2018-11-14 16:02:55 JFC. When I Can't get oil market answers from you is disappointing enough, but you cite that ridiculous show as the reason is just devastating..smdh.
5187 2018-11-14 16:02:55 Before Standard Oil Company was split into 34 companies in 1911, the monopoly owned over 90% of American oil.
5188 2018-11-14 16:02:47 We burn more oil than we produce so it seems likely that a drop in prices helps cash flow. But the producers get their stocks or bonds hit as investors discount future cash flows as well.
5189 2018-11-14 16:02:46 Labour & Tories conned Scotland over it's oil assets by keeping us in the dark... They are trying (in conjuction with the MSM) to do the exact same over brexit..  When it comes to Scotland Tories & Labour have always been #BetterTogether Only @theSNP speaks for me & mine...
5190 2018-11-14 16:02:43 Actually if you understand it properly it is the activists opposing CDN oil exports that are causing increased damage to the environment and also to CDA’s ability to deliver social programs ... of course you don’t have to believe that; though if you think it through it is logical

5195 2018-11-14 16:02:23 Idk why ppl are such in a rush. They always ask how long for an oil change. I will say 20 minutes. They’ll be like nah I’m good and walk away.
5196 2018-11-14 16:02:01 If u believe in diesel coming from a rock then u need help....diesel will never be extracted from nature as diesel its extracted as crude oil..then u do the distillation processes to separate the different types of oil obtained 4rm crude oil

What's next
5200 2018-11-14 16:01:44 @JustinTrudeau The combination of WTI price collapse plus already ultra-wide WTI-WCS differentials has sent the flat price of Western Canadian Select to $15.7 a barrel, quickly approaching the 2016 low of $12.9 a barrel. Lots, lots, really lots of pain in #Alberta |  #Canada #oil
5201 2018-11-14 16:01:41 Shame on you, pushing and profiting from palm oil. #nomorecadburys
5202 2018-11-14 16:01:37 You aren't really that dumb. Oil for fertilizer and plastic is a tiny percentage of overall oil use. We need to save oil for that stuff and stop burning it. You are actively preventing us from making a concerted transition away from it.

5207 2018-11-14 16:01:06 apparently I'm leaking oil from the line to fix my timing chain which is bad because they have to remove the engine to fix it a whopping $2,850 so I'm going to need to buy a car soon
5208 2018-11-14 16:01:03 It made sense too because I JUST dunked my #SoulFoilage (formerly known as the "#Afro") into coconut oil to SEE. It wasn't  racist or prejudice the #Energy DIDN'T feel that way!

5213 2018-11-14 16:00:50 This 1 point is naive. These laws aren't enforced, n companies try to avoid it. I could find some vids if ure interested. 1 of my friends is working on a tech to help clean up oil spills, n he thinks that just cuz he makes it, companies will use it cuz it's the right thing to do.
5214 2018-11-14 16:00:44 Palm oil is  in most snack foods. The orangatan is being stripped of it's home at a prodigeous rate to procure this palm oil . We can save them from extinction..stop buying palm oil . Read every label. Read about the plight of the orangatan @natgeo..
thank you.
5215 2018-11-14 16:00:43 Why is it that ur headlines are misleading? Ur report was much to do about nothing considering it told ur readers absolutely nothing useable! Ur headline should of read “just another crappy report on oil”

5226 2018-11-14 15:59:46 No use oil please
5227 2018-11-14 15:59:45 Are taxi drivers telling you to short oil?
5228 2018-11-14 15:59:43 Hey!! PSA!!! There’s an app that is called “Sustainable Palm Oil” that you can scan items to see if they have palm oil and it suggests other products to get in replacement that do not use the oil. If you really want to help get this app!!!!

5247 2018-11-14 15:57:14 They're well versed in that practice. They used to by great quantities of Spanish olive oil and re-label it as Italian. Not sure if that still happens.

5261 2018-11-14 15:55:54 Hi Michael, thanks for posting. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks again

5284 2018-11-14 15:53:42 Yeah, so we agree on two things then: oil will still a player in the future, and that the extraction of crude has been poorly handled. Extraction of crude does NOT HAVE TO go hand in hand with severe destruction. However, it is does recklessly and irresponsibly.
5285 2018-11-14 15:53:40 Eh, the old school rich will be the new poor since they can’t get past crude oil.

5292 2018-11-14 15:53:05 Hi Neil, palm oil is by far the most productive vegetable oil around, and shifting to an alternative will inevitably demand even more land and water to produce the same volume. We need to fix the food system by ensuring our palm oil is sustainably grown and deforestation-free.

5295 2018-11-14 15:52:32 Agreed. Super important. Now is the time to daily dig into the Word and soak up that Oil. Pray without ceasing. Confess our sins as soon as we realize we have dirtied our feet. Walk in righteousness, and WATCH for Him. The midnight call will go out very soon.
5296 2018-11-14 15:52:30 Your assurance is an assumption. The Saudis >had< plenty of money. They emptied their coffers into public+military spending since Arab Spring, pushed oil production up despite price drop to make up for this. al-Sauds are bleeding themselves dry to extend their own power. #cdnpoli
5297 2018-11-14 15:52:21 ...yeah, I’m not gonna trust a study on immigration coming from a group whose stated goal is to reduce all immigration. That’s like asking oil executives if fracking is okay.
5298 2018-11-14 15:52:05 As long as oil stays green I’m fine
5299 2018-11-14 15:52:03 Oil is a joke
5300 2018-11-14 15:51:59 Correction: we have much more than crude oil, but no other energy source can be exploited better & more efficiently, although this is gradually being disproven with more and more research into alternatives & renewables.
5301 2018-11-14 15:51:52 America would have ended up having to join the war regardless because they cut off Japan's oil supplies. This would have meant that America would either be viewed as sympathetic to the Allies and attacked, or attacked to try and intimidate them (eventual outcome) (1)

5307 2018-11-14 15:51:35 These Economists just can’t seem to make up their mind:
Oil prices go up- it’s bad for the economy! High inflation ...blah blah!
Oil prices go down- it’s bad for the economy! Sign of a Global slowdown! Guys make up your mind! Either way you are making your big bucks!!!

5314 2018-11-14 15:51:09 The world is so overpopulated & so energy-dependent that we are constantly trying to find out more energy sources with higher punching power. For now, all we have is crude oil, and if we find an environment-friendly alternative energy source, I’m all for it & will support it.
5315 2018-11-14 15:50:57 Yep, we partied with the cast at the Coolgardie camel farm  & Midnight Oil filmed a lot of the ‘Blue Sky Mine’ vid around the Goldfields, and the salt lakes around Kambalda. The ‘in the end the rain comes down’, part was filmed in the main drag of Kalgoorlie, with fire trucks
5316 2018-11-14 15:50:52 Sad and ridiculous story, I was training someone in the restaurant I worked at. There was heated oil in the pan and our sausage was frozen. I said "carefully put the sausage into the pan". Dickhead goes and throws it in and I got seriously burned all over my arm. People be dumb.
5317 2018-11-14 15:50:52 Oil prices down for the 12th session in a row.
5318 2018-11-14 15:50:40 Hi Joey, thanks for posting. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks again
5319 2018-11-14 15:50:35 Investigate the use of dried Miraa, we could ditch tea and coffee farming and overtake oil producing countries in wealth.
5320 2018-11-14 15:50:31 At pause oil then co to us
#cl_f. #ES_F Trump numbers
5321 2018-11-14 15:50:02 Definitely. In the long term, it is therefore better to work with the palm oil (and other vegetable oil sectors) to shift them to sustainability rather than to try to boycott its use.
5322 2018-11-14 15:50:01 Maybe finally we will have whatnthe rest of the world have yes yes yes we don’t need armies going to countries to destroy them because we benefit from their oil enough it’s enough don’t lie to yourselves it’s time to open our eyes and educate and not let governments to brain wash

5324 2018-11-14 15:49:46 I’m not arguing for it’s dominance at all. I’m saying that whether the world moves into alternatives or renewables or sticks with oil as an energy source, oil will still be in demand, although in not very high figures, and will still be of valuable use to humanity for decades.
5325 2018-11-14 15:49:42 When are we going to do@something about climate change and these oil companies ????
5326 2018-11-14 15:49:40 Black Friday has started early here at I-95 Toyota! No need to wait until next week for deals on your favorite Corollas! These two beauties are certified pre-owned and ready for their new home! Both come with 7yr/125,000 mile powertrain warranties and oil changes for life!
5327 2018-11-14 15:49:39 #Ghana's #inflation down to 9.5% y/y in Oct from 9.8% in Sep,  lowest rate in c. 6 years. Resonates with exp that infltn would remain within 6-10% target into 2019. Makes for intrsting 26 Nov MPC decision esp with the rcnt fall in #oil prices. Take more gdnce from 2moro's budget.
5328 2018-11-14 15:49:32 Steve retail spending is still 70% of GDP and lower gas prices increases discretionary spending. Also $65 oil is still profitable for most producers
5329 2018-11-14 15:49:22 Could never tolerate Blair! sneaky snake oil salesman.

5331 2018-11-14 15:49:16 Try getting at least one pipeline built inside the country you manage. It may help the current price of Cdn oil and raise it from $18.00 to world price. Maybe then you'll have some credibility.
5332 2018-11-14 15:49:15 @CBCEarlyEdition Thanks for exposing @cathmckenna and our government's sad prioritization of oil and gas over the environment.

5334 2018-11-14 15:49:10 I gave her a half bottle of cbd oil and she took 2ml of some 25mg/ml oil and said she had the best sleep of her life. Was waking without her limp. Now she’s all in on the cbd. I’ve told her for years how much it helped me, but it took seeing it herself to really believe lol
5335 2018-11-14 15:49:03 So when are we gonna do something about climate change and these oil companies !?!?!?!?
5336 2018-11-14 15:48:58 @Oreo any comment regarding your use of palm oil and your part in deforestation caused by use of it?

5339 2018-11-14 15:48:29 Aseem is Right about coconut oil, of course, but he’s a little late on Harvard’s reputation. Seidelmann, et al. took care of that. Besides, with all those photogenic nutritionalists supporting it, how bad could it be?

5344 2018-11-14 15:48:12 So Charles as BIG TICKET items go, do you think people will purchase homes or Autos based on saving .10-.15 cents at the pump or the market up 25%?? Precipitous drops in Oil call into question Global Growth and the STRENGTH of economies...Psychology of markets now TERRIBLE!
5345 2018-11-14 15:48:06 It is entirely hypocritical to focus on NGO funding from foreign sources in defense of the oil and gas industry in Canada when that very industry is almost entirely foreign controlled!  I know a good number of the people in the enviro NGO community and all are solid  Canadians.
5346 2018-11-14 15:47:59 @CadburyUK any comment regarding your use of palm oil and your part in massive deforestation caused by its use?
5347 2018-11-14 15:47:59 I'll fly out with the winner to Los Angeles where you'll be burned the midnight oil.
5348 2018-11-14 15:47:53 nope. I LOVE dry shampoo. does many things. keeps your scalp and hair better protected. use good argon oil to moisturize the hair and gather & loosen dirt. then the dry shampoo absorbs excess oil and you brush it all out. I usually add a bit of argon oil back to the ends
5349 2018-11-14 15:47:52 Bruh.. Your economy was Oil driven, that brought in Private sector revenues for your Govt to tax and all was good. But there was no diversification. Oil $ is down, now the Govt only has Taxpayers $ to spend. Olympics would have kicked started a 2nd revenue line while Oil is down
5350 2018-11-14 15:47:51 I'm not drunk and it was olive oil. Get your facts right.
5351 2018-11-14 15:47:48 I wish that we all could forget Willard Romney, period. The snakes want their oil back.

5355 2018-11-14 15:47:36 That moment you find out that a well known Mental Health "charity" has just released a new podcast that is being sponsored by a "Natural Super Food Supplement" company *rolls eyes* 

Its not often I say it but I agree with @campaignforleo 

Food supplements are snake oil. #Woo

5357 2018-11-14 15:47:31 This should be on tv.  People may think twice before purchasing items containing Palm oil.
5358 2018-11-14 15:47:25 Norway's in the single market or as near as makes no difference. Has enough oil to export and sovereign wealth. Neither need to even be 'in' anything. The City of London does. Not component businesses. They can move, set up subsidiaries. But the City itself. Other services too.
5359 2018-11-14 15:47:21 I get to spend 2-3 hours waiting for my car to get inspected and oil change. #LuckyMe
5360 2018-11-14 15:47:21 This is despicable. Gibraltar given access to Brexit deal to give their response. Not so for Scotland - or Wales. Presumably NI DUP will have had access, so why not for rest of us? As usual WM only need Scotland for their resources, oil,fish,agriculture, whisky,gas,etc.
5361 2018-11-14 15:47:14 Estimado deseo saber si tienen algún proyecto de promoción Turística para visitar su bella Provincia con respecto al Gas Oil dado que en Enero queremos visitar San Luis en nuestra MotorHome y nos resulta muy honeroso el combustible.Gracias por responder a la brevedad

5364 2018-11-14 15:46:54 Germans needed oil, so they focused on the south.

5366 2018-11-14 15:46:49 Hmmmm.... Ethics and Democrats.... That's the same as oil and water. Doesn't mix well. Question: What are Democrats afraid of? What don't Democrats want revealed? Must be really horrible for them to go such extreme measures. Don't you think?

THIS IS NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA 
Time to change the oil power
BRING IT TO THE AMERICAS
5369 2018-11-14 15:46:36 Nick, still ignoring the 3 questions he can’t even answer. Which is good for the union but not for his credibility. Shetlands - a mute point, as you’re further from an iscot than ever, but how many oil fields are within 12 miles of Scotland?
5370 2018-11-14 15:46:34 It is destructive because of the careless & reckless ways engineers & politicians have been manhandling production since the industry began in Oil Creek, PA. Blowouts used to be a good thing in the 30’s but now it’s a different story - there are laws protecting the environment.
5371 2018-11-14 15:46:28 Daaaaamn @hasanminhaj coming in with the jabs to Big Oil and shining a light on the impact this industry has on climate change during @patriotact !! We need more shows to take up this issue!

Virginia. @ge has been working to free up shares of @BHGECO in order to accelerate asset sales
5378 2018-11-14 15:46:10 Seems like the entire Canadian energy space has disconnected from oil prices and is priced for insolvency.
5379 2018-11-14 15:46:09 Working outchea in dese oil fields
5380 2018-11-14 15:46:05 Hmm. What's pushing oil prices...hmmm
Oh,i understand its not hard.))) The answer is your president and your goverment.
5381 2018-11-14 15:46:00 Do foxconn now . Then oil companies
5382 2018-11-14 15:46:00 “The study is still the first to confirm that the ocean is warming using a method independent of direct ocean temperature measurements.”
Yep Climate Change is baloney. Everyone go home & burn more oil.
5383 2018-11-14 15:45:59 Exactly. For me I’d love them to loose restrictions, go to town on pumping oil with pipelines shipping it to the east/west costs. Make a boat load in tax revenue, take that revenue & build green tech so we have cleaner energy. Once big enough we could export that too one day.
5384 2018-11-14 15:45:58 @grazedotcom is your palm oil also Rainforest Alliance? I would put this mention / logos on your packaging. It put me off buying your protein bites in store, before I did some research myself.
5385 2018-11-14 15:45:40 Oil "shocks" are not as big an influence as they were when they first happened ( 1970's ???)
5386 2018-11-14 15:45:38 Oil price is down because of what Tesla started 5 years ago... a throrough understanding of energy markets, indeed...
5387 2018-11-14 15:45:36 Ur point also supports the reason why oil has been v dominant in the past.
5388 2018-11-14 15:45:21 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]

5394 2018-11-14 15:45:04 yeah just to prevent tangles, then when it dries i split the sections into two every day and reapply oil til friday when i wear my hair out then repeat on mondays
5395 2018-11-14 15:45:04 It’s what I use every night! My deep skin routine consist of a charcoal peel, followed by a brown sugar scrub w tea tree & coconut oil (one other oil i can’t remember rn, thayers witch hazel & then the serum i told ya!

5398 2018-11-14 15:44:45 The fact that OIL made the cover of WSJ tells it all on why the crash is over.

5402 2018-11-14 15:44:42 It would probably depend on the product.  Palm oil is not just in foods, it's possibly in your toothpaste, cleaning products, etc.  But a lot of products can actually be made more simply, with fewer "ingredients" and aka chemicals.
5403 2018-11-14 15:44:25 Hindus celebrate #Diwali. We don't use a candle, but light oil lamps. Sesame oil or ghee (clarified butter) is used to light a lamp because it exudes positivity and has its own field of energy. @Sadhgurujv

5408 2018-11-14 15:44:11 In these replies: people who have only ever heard of socialism from their highschool econ teacher that used to work for an oil company
5409 2018-11-14 15:44:04 okay true, AND that does not negate the fact that it is destructive and archaic. Ur point supports the high probability that oil will still b v much a part of the energy picture as the developing countries increase their living standards.
5410 2018-11-14 15:44:02 Spray those fences will oil...done.
5411 2018-11-14 15:43:56 Who stands more to gain from causing doubt about the affects of climate change, scientists, or oil company execs seeking to stop regulation that could halt their profits? Humans causing damage to our environment is nothing new. Look at how many species we have made extinct.

5417 2018-11-14 15:43:31 Yeah, IMO, falling crude oil means we aren't using it. Hard for economies to expand without fuel. Intermarket cycles say that falling crude and rising dollar eventually signal the end of the recession. That's when it's a good thing. We're not trying to end a recession right now

5432 2018-11-14 15:42:27 The last time oil prices posted such a steep one-day slide, three years ago, crude was in the midst of a rout that eventually dragged down equity prices,
5433 2018-11-14 15:42:23 CBD oil (full spectrum) and cannabis. 

I had surgery to remove it throughout my abdomen, I really feel for her. It's excruciating. Surgery helped but they couldn't get it all. I am no longer on pain meds (narcotic/opioid), and using Cannabis + CBD has been a lifesaver.
5434 2018-11-14 15:42:22 I... I have "hate" for people who don't have basic empathy, which means people who defend Donald Trump.
You think the US is advanced because it has turned it's economy on making war, stealing oil, killing innocents. If it has so much money, why is there so MUCH people struggling?
5435 2018-11-14 15:42:19 @Varneyco  As oil goes down, please talk about home heating oil prices.
5436 2018-11-14 15:41:48 Turn me one more time
delicate ballerina in a forgotten box,
the moon sleeps at my window
the doves watch o'er the city lights,

all is quiet but I am restless
to dance that ghostly nocturne,

in your shadow,
beneath the burn of midnight oil,
my song still comes alive.

5439 2018-11-14 15:41:17 Hi David, palm oil is by far the most productive vegetable oil presently produced at a large scale. A shift to other vegetable oils will inevitably mean demand for more agricultural land and water to produce the same volume.

5446 2018-11-14 15:40:39 The problem is: we cannot have it both ways: have it as a form of insurance and increase investment to meet future oil demand.  Future demand needs “insurance” too!
5447 2018-11-14 15:40:39 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

Just tell me percentage of govt taxes central and state on basic crude oil price then (apr 2014) and now (nov 2018).
5449 2018-11-14 15:40:33 the politics of oil is what hampers pipelines...the $$$ public and private are there...2 things need to happen, 1 - safe pipelines in canada east and west & 2 - reduction of foreign oil on our east coast. money allocated from province and feds is 'unrelated' to oil industry.

5452 2018-11-14 15:40:26 The worrying thing is that coal has peaked because of a reduction in demand, not supply. Which means it's always possible for something (war or peak oil for example) to send it climbing again.

5472 2018-11-14 15:39:10 That was pre planned. I guess trumph is leading the racket of global insider traders to manipulate & swing the oil prices for their own sake.

5480 2018-11-14 15:38:12 Further complementing the high energy density of crude oil is its affordability & feasibility. The true value of crude oil is in its products, and based on the product crack spreads, I’m fairly certain that the world has a fantastic bargain for such a valuable raw material.

5498 2018-11-14 15:36:49 Kevin -- do you have, or have you seen, an estimate for the proportion of Alberta's oil output that is exposed to these low prices and how much avoids them either by committed transport capacity and/or vertical integration?

5527 2018-11-14 15:34:22 #Oil crash seems like another lose-lose for stocks. If it’s  supply/speculation driven then great, lower prices for consumers = stimulus = easier path for Powell. If it’s demand driven... not great for anyone.

5535 2018-11-14 15:33:40 Plus, the need for oil companies to be in oil rich Texas bares no resemblance to companies not based on natural resources. And the sport stadiums section is irrelevant. But does show that this is a bugbear for the author rather than answering if the incentives helped lure Amazon
5536 2018-11-14 15:33:40 Our oil industry tanked 5 years ago, taking our economy with it. Since then, if our civic leaders have initiated such a desperately needed consultation process/strategy, I'm unaware of it. I hope they will do so, now. I think citizens are hungry for a long-term vision.
5537 2018-11-14 15:33:37 Especially not here in Texas. Texas has both oil and a robust renewable energy sector, both of which are affected when oil prices fall.
5538 2018-11-14 15:33:33 Last year our area had 23 days of cloud cover in December. No wind to speak of. How was the power produced you ask? Coal and natural gas. Battery technology not good enough yet to store the needed power. Still need fossil fuels no matter what these snake oil salesman say...

5548 2018-11-14 15:32:44 But fact is they cannot sustain curbing in oil supply.
5549 2018-11-14 15:32:35 Don't forget that Canadian oil has things like HR departments, employee safety and environmental regulations.

All this adds to the carbon footprint in our oil compared to that from other countries.

5559 2018-11-14 15:31:46 I mean there definitely is some ambiguity in how exactly attributive '-ing' forms relate to the head noun. A running kid is a kid that's running, but a running race is not a race that is running. Cooking oil is oil you cook with, not oil that cooks.
5560 2018-11-14 15:31:45 Hi Dave, thanks for posting. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks again
5561 2018-11-14 15:31:42 One 3 letter word lies at the heart of why this is so. OIL. Much of it because people are afraid, right? Why? Because fear of terrorists. Where from? Middle East? Why? Because West went after oil; attacking tribes, creating mixed nations like Iraq, sowing seeds of hate & chaos.

5598 2018-11-14 15:28:07 Interesting thing about crude oil is man hasn’t found, to my knowledge, another energy source that has the same or a larger energy density than that of crude oil. It packs a bigger punch per gallon than any other known energy source, given all of the stuff we can make from it.
5599 2018-11-14 15:28:02 I think we can do a lot more then resource work but it doesn’t mean we turn our back on our biggest asset. That’s like Saudi’s stopping oil production to do tech. The more resources we can produce the more tax we make, the more the government can spend on beefing up other sectors

5607 2018-11-14 15:27:36 I would like an answer to this. I read stuff about 100% sustainable palm oil (used by Nutella and Lidl for example) but then I don't know if it truly counts. Also, it seems to be so hard to find stuff free of palm oil, especially shampoo.

5616 2018-11-14 15:26:51 You’re such a chicken.

5622 2018-11-14 15:26:19 I already do. It’s difficult as Palm Oil is in a lot of products that I consume. It’s heartbreaking but I try and lead by example to friends and family. Unfortunately complacency and apathy is what I face from most ppl! But I can at least do my bit with a good conscience

5633 2018-11-14 15:25:21 Fed talking after the close today. This is usually not bullish. There is an off chance that they see disinflation coming off of lower oil prices, but I wouldn't bet on it.
5634 2018-11-14 15:25:15 It's been another good morning. I don't want to push it and risk gains. Plus it's -7C outside with snow on the ground. Back here tomorrow with CRUDE OIL EIA event that pushed from today to Thursday. Very full economic calendar tomorrow Cheers.

5713 2018-11-14 15:18:57 There is no debate.  The only conversation we need to have us who's going to clean up the $260 billion mess left behind by the oil industry in Alberta?  Royalty rates need to reflect the real cost of the tar sands.
5714 2018-11-14 15:18:57 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

5726 2018-11-14 15:17:38 I can't even watch this video. CBD oil and Hempseed capsules saved my life. I'm off 13 legal prescriptions since 2016. I'm living proof!!
5727 2018-11-14 15:17:33 1) No matter how bad Trump is, those two DO NOT DESERVE ANY REHABILITATION. Lied to get us to invade Iraq (oil), committed crimes against humanity (torture, killing
5728 2018-11-14 15:17:27 Oh cry me a river. It feels pretty good to blame someone for natural disasters doesn't it? People die every day destroying the environment. How many lives have been lost or forever destroyed by oil fires or pipeline construction? By Nuclear disasters?

5741 2018-11-14 15:16:23 Epson salt bath with a bit of lavender oil, meditation,  kiran chanting
5742 2018-11-14 15:16:22 Normally going down the rate of crude oil... just before the elections. Why? not after that.
5743 2018-11-14 15:16:19 Agree on the cost part which plays a major role. It is the most seeking oil in the world so it's health risk is suppressed very powerfully.
5744 2018-11-14 15:16:16 Lucky BJP for the election if Brent remains below $70 cong has one issue less of oil prices
5745 2018-11-14 15:16:14 Calgary doesn't participate in oil revenue directly, the province does. However, the Feds take a lot of that and redistribute it all over the country. We get killed on oil prices b/c there is no ability to get it to market. YYC now has a big property tax hole to fill downtown.
5746 2018-11-14 15:16:04 I recently tried some ways of coloring .
My ideal is like oil painting, and I have tried that way since I was a teenager.
But the result always gives me fatigue and discouragement.
 (It's a sweet suffering.)
5747 2018-11-14 15:16:03 @BBCsarahsmith is way out of her depth with Bannon. That snake oil salesman will come out on top. She wont even scratch the surface never mind challenge him.
5748 2018-11-14 15:15:52 Democrats care about the environment uh? Right, like how a Democratic President in Obama opened the Arctic to oil drilling, never proposed or implemented Green jobs programs and multiplied war efforts pouring toxic chemicals by the tonne into the earth? Right, I see your point.
5749 2018-11-14 15:15:46 In a different universe, fossil fuels do not exist. The world is dependent on whale oil and environmental policy is determined by Whale Oil Execs.
5750 2018-11-14 15:15:32 I’m pretty sure it was before 1998.

5752 2018-11-14 15:15:07 I use castor oil le glycerine to oil and it up once a week. For daily styling I use Sta-so-fro braid spray.
For wash days I moisturise ka hair food, castor oil and glycerine.
I just believe our hair wasn't meant for lots of products, our hair is strong AF it just needs moisture

5755 2018-11-14 15:14:58 Im British too,,we all are if we live on Britain.
Can you not see the UK is a club run by England for the benefit of England?
You let them take 92% of our oil so you can be what you are already,BRITISH
5756 2018-11-14 15:14:55 Did not know how expensive an oil change is; did know my dad is the greatest for always taking care of me and my car and everything else
5757 2018-11-14 15:14:55 I hope it helps. My grandmums use Cocoa Butter. If you've ever come across the original, brown big plastic tin?
Also argan oil is fantastic
5758 2018-11-14 15:14:33 I’m Trini and even I know this oil down too dry
5759 2018-11-14 15:14:32 There was a joke in a French-Canadian vampire movie where the missing ingredient of a magic spell got ripped away. All they knew was [something] grease, or in French, Oil of [elbow].
5760 2018-11-14 15:14:29 Hi there, thanks for posting. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks again
5761 2018-11-14 15:14:24 You know it’s dry out when you put your face oil on an your skin soaks it up in less than 10 minutes and is still dry.  #ihatewinter
5762 2018-11-14 15:14:17 If u go to a 15 min oil change there’s a high chance they ain’t even changing the filter.. learn how to change the oil yourself
5763 2018-11-14 15:14:08 Well the resson activist target Canada is basically because they're lazy and cowards. There's no repercussions for them protesting Canadian oil as they make quite a comfortable living being a career avitivist. Canadian politicians both provincially and federally have no balls.
5764 2018-11-14 15:14:01 I seee. I guna HL cleansing oil tu rasa mcm power sbb everytime mmg rasa grits tu pimples takde la teruk sgt cuma mak tegur sbb muka i tk pernah naik sampai gitu. Rasa mcm kena stop few skincare & stick to 3 basic things je. Cleansing balm pon you guna every night ke?
5765 2018-11-14 15:13:59 wow coconut oil works pretty good at cleaning your teeth and isn’t totally toxic for you
5766 2018-11-14 15:13:57 ใช้แล้วสิวไม่ค่อยขึ้นนะคะ แต่ว่าเซรั่มจะเหนอะหน่อยเพราะว่าผสม oil ด้วยค่ะ
5767 2018-11-14 15:13:45 Is Gartman long oil?
5768 2018-11-14 15:13:43 He shared all oil wells among cronies and steady he is receiving kick back..
5769 2018-11-14 15:13:42 Wah u talking bout the "oil down" thing?
5770 2018-11-14 15:13:33 not a silly question but sadly the oil is full.
5771 2018-11-14 15:13:31 piers morgan saying soybean farming is twice as destructive compared to palm oil. he's right in asking how come there's no campaign vs soybean and suggested bcos vegans might be offended. even called them the vegan mafia lol
5772 2018-11-14 15:13:26 Might wanna have a look from where you import oil as well. And if you're going to tell me before buying oil you made sure it's not from UAE then yep I'm definitely believing you 
5773 2018-11-14 15:13:16 Who doesn’t take anything seriously! Really. Today we are in much better position than US! Exit polls from midterms show economic wellbeing of average US citizen has not improved. Better plan here over long term. Think past oil!!!
5774 2018-11-14 15:13:11 It's even overpriced. 2lt cooking oil must be around $1.60 in US$ terms! That $3 is a bond note value!
5775 2018-11-14 15:13:05 Come by today and pick up a bottle of #CBD oil or our NEW capsules! With the cold coming, it's never a bad idea to get ahead of the aches and pains.

5781 2018-11-14 15:12:44 ‘Acting on Climate Change’ To-do list:

- Enact a #GreenNewDeal ASAP

- Counter big oil money with small donations until we can reverse Citizens United and get dark money out of politics

- Make sure Democrats win the next 10 election cycles
5782 2018-11-14 15:12:43 Nobody expects Hannity to tell the truth at any time.... he's a "LIAR FOR MONEY".

5784 2018-11-14 15:12:41 Getting furnace oil from a new service provider in PEI is like getting security clearance to work at CSIS, applying for a mortgage, and having your house inspected all wrapped into one. What did these companies do 25 years ago when you needed emergency oil delivery? #PEI

Whatever. Just send me some.
5788 2018-11-14 15:12:23 Market opens risk off due to fresh global growth concerns
• OPEC, partners discuss oil supply cut of up to 1.4 million bpd -
• British PM May tries to sell Brexit deal to ministers -
5789 2018-11-14 15:12:15 Poor oil on the bars and keep retreating
5790 2018-11-14 15:12:15 Yes I guess
5791 2018-11-14 15:12:13 And palm oil for no reason... if you grind it fresh you don’t need to stir
5792 2018-11-14 15:12:12 จอบอ
5793 2018-11-14 15:12:08 biggest mistake women make is just putting oil in the hair. oil locks in moisture but if your hair is dry you’re locking in the dryness. tea tree oil is the best imo
5794 2018-11-14 15:12:03 Newman dropping truth bombs like RCR has a massive stockpile of oil 
5795 2018-11-14 15:11:53 Big oil has no heart. Big surprise.  Another treasure gone. Typical Houston.
5796 2018-11-14 15:11:49 I shall blow at the screen again and I reckon my

5797 2018-11-14 15:11:38 Short Answer: Yes.  Long Answer: Yes but then they'll still sell anyway, oil is on the way out and they know it.

5799 2018-11-14 15:11:29 Need a oil change
5800 2018-11-14 15:11:28 Could you eat an entire loaf of bread in less than 3 minutes?

(In the hypothetical u could use oil & butter - no jelly, jams, or preserves)
5801 2018-11-14 15:11:27 The real divide here is that the IOCs would like to spend less ( lose less money now on the path to First Oil) while GoU would like to be in a position to gain more when oil starts flowing in the future. Both sides can win but the process needs to more trust than I hear today.
5802 2018-11-14 15:11:13 Ironically, if chart goes any lower they may actually HIT oil.

5804 2018-11-14 15:10:57 Greg, you nailed it again. Oil up right now over 2%. I expect a MONSTER rally in oil to over $60/barrel by Friday. If they have to resurrect Napoleon to do it, oil IS going up. What a sham our reality is!!!
5805 2018-11-14 15:10:55 Looks like oil from here
5806 2018-11-14 15:10:52 "When oil prices were at their highest, between 2010 and 2014, that was when we had the sharpest rise in debts.” the facts are there right at your fingers but no you rather chose to mislead gullible people and remain proudly ignorant. Just a pity

5808 2018-11-14 15:10:41 3-month annualized core CPI came in at the slowest pace since July 2017. While it is ex-energy, the sharp drop in Crude Oil over the last six weeks likely delays the pending inflation story to further down the road.
5809 2018-11-14 15:10:40 Homie slathered in baby oil at 10am taking pics and vids in the crib. His bm must be at work and the kids in school. That  gotta be at least 4/5.
5810 2018-11-14 15:10:39 I don’t get this dive because the gun lobbyists are the ones who influence gun regulations. The oil company is setting the fuel economy standard.
5811 2018-11-14 15:10:35 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]

5813 2018-11-14 15:10:33 Funny you mention that trade. I was thinking early this morning that short NG/long oil had to be the worst paired trade for a hedge fund.
5814 2018-11-14 15:10:26 It’s faster to take my car for an oil change than to do it myself.

* Did we all get too negative on Europe?
* OIL! For inflation, commodity-currencies, gas prices and credit...
* USD seems range bound - what's the sell signal?

5824 2018-11-14 15:09:45 What do you think the appropriate ratio of oil to natural gas production would be optimal for a producer?
5825 2018-11-14 15:09:44 I wonder why our Gvt always talks of multi-billion dollar projects when we can't even raise a billion to reduce current budget deficit. (Diamond, chrome, platinum &Lithium mining, Muzarabani Oil explorations,Command Agriculture,Housing projects,University infrastructure etc).

5832 2018-11-14 15:09:03 @TomOsborneMHA You just recently changed your projected price of oil up to $75 from your original budget forecast of $63, it is currently trading at just above $65 will you be adjusting your projected price or reducing your spending ? #nlpoli

5838 2018-11-14 15:08:41 Not saying democrats are better people but democrats can’t afford to throw it’s citizen off the window while oil exporting dictators can.
5839 2018-11-14 15:08:40 That’s true I just wanted to voice my opinion that I don’t believe ditching palm oil is the best way of addressing the issue (that tweet was part of a thread)

5842 2018-11-14 15:08:35 Crude oil plunged as feared to near the upper side of a bearish objective range. Clearly the minor long-term trend is bearish. Some point to oversupply and seasonal factors. But others consider deceleration of global Econ and China on its way to recession. #crudeoil

5850 2018-11-14 15:07:51 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
5851 2018-11-14 15:07:46 Hire a young VP from an Oil Major who is a Biologic/Petroleum Engineer at heart to lead Energy for the next decade. Bob Walsh wants to Change The World, not be on earnings calls. Let him do that.
5852 2018-11-14 15:07:44 Still would be better if you removed all palm oil from your products and sourced a more sustainable alternative. No matter how good you say you are you still use it and there are no 100% guarantees.
5853 2018-11-14 15:07:43 The way my schedule is set up, I have absolutely no time to get an oil change and by the time I’m free all the shops are closed
5854 2018-11-14 15:07:41 Oil struggles to find footing after 7% slide as outlook darkens:MORE "PHUX NUDES MEDIA" BULLSHIT !

5855 2018-11-14 15:07:35 Heating oil +3.6%.
5856 2018-11-14 15:07:27 Do your research and u will see that at a point in time, non oil revenue was higher than monies gotten from oil. So is it that u want the diversification to yielding results or what i dont know, but if anything stuffs like this take time to achieve not forgetting sabotage
5857 2018-11-14 15:07:25 Certainly not
5858 2018-11-14 15:07:22 Baby oil and lioncloths only. Hail and Kill.
5859 2018-11-14 15:07:20 Crude oil plunged as feared to near the upper side of a bearish objective range. Clearly the minor long-term trend is bearish. Some point to oversupply and seasonal factors. But others consider deceleration of global Econ and China on its way to recession. #crudeoil
5860 2018-11-14 15:07:10 Would be Interesting to cross plot the GDP number to oil price.  2nd quarter and 3rd have robust oil $. 4th not looking so good.
5861 2018-11-14 15:07:07 Yes...For sure there is an issue of too much light oil and not enough heavy...Although with time the refineries should adapt. Same with this WTI-Brent USD 10 differential.

5864 2018-11-14 15:06:57 [my first day as a mechanic]

customer: i need an oil change

me: ma'am, i'm pretty sure it's actually your car that needs an oil change
5865 2018-11-14 15:06:51 Do you know how difficult to purify EPA from a mixture of fatty acids? Saying that it is derived from fish oil show lack of Chemistry knowledge. Of course it is, so what!
5866 2018-11-14 15:06:42 me too - i did try taking selfie then saw no makeup, bad hair and thought winning score was better option.  I told my son i hope oil will only win if we're there - cause i don't see me back there anytime soon - too many people and too little patience and too expensive
5867 2018-11-14 15:06:41 Cauldrons of boiling oil strategically placed upon the roof, ready to drown out the BS! 
5868 2018-11-14 15:06:38 Hi there, thanks for posting. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks again

5878 2018-11-14 15:05:15 Palm oil is also REALLY BAD for human health.
There are much healthier, more sustainable alternatives.
5879 2018-11-14 15:05:12 Any argan oil shampoos! I had beauty works weave and thats what i was recommended x
5880 2018-11-14 15:05:07 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
5881 2018-11-14 15:05:07 Same answer as the time you tweeted it the first time round. They need our Oil  and energy as a bargaining chip while all the while telling us its worthless.
5882 2018-11-14 15:05:05 Yes, I fully agree. But who will the govt. listen to more? Owners of bars and shops, or car manufacturers and road builders?  Years ago in the USA, oil/car companies actually bought up bus services and shut them down to boost demand for their products!

5890 2018-11-14 15:04:29 It's something though? And they're own brand Iceland products are all palm oil & plastic free. Better than nothing / more effort than I've seen any other supermarket making
5891 2018-11-14 15:04:25 I just tried oil pulling with coconut oil and I swear it has to be one of the nastiest consistencies I've ever felt in my mouth before, recommended for no one

5893 2018-11-14 15:04:15 So you think scots are better in a union where we have no say and 92% of our oil revenues are taken by Westminster?
Why do you want Tories and labour to make Scotland part of England?
You don't want union you want to ne RULED OVER
Are you not ashamed?
5894 2018-11-14 15:04:10 I avoid pakai cleansing oil sebb i naik ting bumps even dah avoid mineral oil,  i prefer double cleanse dngn micellar water and cleanser je
5895 2018-11-14 15:04:07 STOP USING PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN PALM OIL IT IS AN ECOLOGICAL DISASTER
5896 2018-11-14 15:04:06 Happy to go toe-to-toe on this erroneous claim. Fair warning...I've written & edited NEPA documents for industry, including pipelines. Also worked in oil & gas for years, & there's nothing illegal at all. The NEPA doc now dated & law requires add'l env & economic analysis.
5897 2018-11-14 15:04:04  @bertkreischer  I’m one of Wazes first ad partners for my chain of oil change shops in central pa. That’s definitely not a service but I sure as hell am suggesting it now!!

Did you know how much goes into cappuccino? Palm kernel vegetable oil is a big ingredient, firms often say it's from "sustainable sources".....
Just can't get away from it 
5900 2018-11-14 15:03:17 I wasn’t intending my response to be an attack if It seemed that way I apologize. More of our products are coming in palm oil free each day. All I can suggest is visit one of the stores and look at the products. From Monday 19th. The full frozen Christmas range will be on sale
5901 2018-11-14 15:03:09 It was Blavatnik's money.  He made a lot selling his gas and oil company to Putin.  No laundering involved.  What has to be proven is whether Putin directed him to give that money.  That will be hard to prove even though we all know that was the case.
5902 2018-11-14 15:03:02 Snake oil mixes with snake oil!
5903 2018-11-14 15:03:02 You seem to not understand what is being talked about. AOC wants to limit Big Oil influence, Pelosi agrees (reason no one called her an enemy), you think AOC attacks Pelosi for agreeing. We ain’t talking about misogyny or Bernie Sanders, why is he brought up?
5904 2018-11-14 15:02:54 HAHAHAHHA LOL DAMN
SORRY HOW WOULD I KNOW PEOPLE PUT OIL ON THEIR FACES
5905 2018-11-14 15:02:46 "Assad" somehow wants to invade is own country? LMAOOOO America just sent the militay to stop a convoy imagine what they would do if Mexicans tried to take over Arizona and call for it to be a different state.

Gene Oil must be paying good money @JoumanaGebara__
5906 2018-11-14 15:02:45 Hi there. Thanks for getting in touch. As of January 2016 we achieved our goal for 100% of the palm oil used in our own label food products in the UK and Ireland to be from RSPO certified, sustainable sources. Thanks again. Gee - Aldi IRL Twitter Team
5907 2018-11-14 15:02:43 The oil price slump suspiciously right after the vote looked set up to harm an independent Scotland's prospects and there was no support from the EU because of the Spanish, in the media that we could see. I basically felt that Westminster would screw us over.
5908 2018-11-14 15:02:43 I know I’m sleeping a lot worse lately because of that and seeing the $2k per household figure cost for the Olympics....having to pay that combined with another plague of unemployed oil engineers starting crappy microbreweries would be too much.
5909 2018-11-14 15:02:36 there are a number of fish oil capsules that are also crap if they're filled with free radicals and use farmed fish as their source

just eat salmon and even shitty salmon will be fine (iirc for some insane reason farmed atlantic salmon has higher OM3 than wild)

You've started oil bunkering? 

Okay.
5914 2018-11-14 15:01:51 whale oil beef hooked
5915 2018-11-14 15:01:47 Nope, quoting BP annual reports. If you get paid to assess oil/gas reserves, you know the relationship between proved, demand, and the timeframe if we only use current proved, whereas the industry knows there is about 200 years of fossil fuel left - plus clathrates.
5916 2018-11-14 15:01:44 And a few weeks ago it was well over 26,000. It corrects from time to time due to the market being too hot. Do you study economics at all. It dropped drastically the other day due to the tech stocks after the 60 min story broke. Also because of oil prices dropping.
5917 2018-11-14 15:01:36 You're going at this like a hysterical female.
STOP and think.
Louisiana's GDP is up 4.2%, mostly because of oil/gas production.
Obama policy was HORRIBLY wrong about this industry, once claiming we only had 2% of the world's oil reserves. 
We don't need gov't raising wages.
5918 2018-11-14 15:01:34 Everything possible should be done to divest or lessen, our presence and interest in the Middle East Oil economy! Which include new energy technologies!
5919 2018-11-14 15:01:18 Currentlu i guna HL cleansing oil. Ada jgk terpikir utk guna cleansing balm tp tgah broke. In shaa Allah soon. Thanks! Btw you guna cleansing balm apa?
5920 2018-11-14 15:01:18 To limit fat in our diets we can use olive oil instead of butter, shortening, and cocunut oils which are all high in saturated fats.

5925 2018-11-14 15:00:55 This could be a silly question but have you checked the oil level? I know we had a similar problem and the oil was low

You're talking the country down = Project Fear
We'll get all the oil and gas money = £350M for NHS
Leaving UK/EU will cost nothing
5927 2018-11-14 15:00:52 Yes. If you process red oil, it is just refined palm oil and it’s not good for you.
5928 2018-11-14 15:00:46 Stir together 2 quarts buritto with 11 lbs hash browns. Blend with Olive Oil. Drain. Serve
5929 2018-11-14 15:00:46 Hmmm I believe judges decided the Bush v Gore race. Not to mention the hysteric Republicans (organized by the snake oil salesman Mr Stone himself) who blocked the recount.

5936 2018-11-14 15:00:30 She wasn't really an outsider as her husband was one of Britain's richest people. She preached trickle down economics which meant big tax breaks for rich people like herself which led to deficits which she dealt with by exhausting North Sea oil revenues

5947 2018-11-14 15:00:04 Stop trying to take away out healthcare. Stop trying to take away reproductive rights. Stop helping oil companies create hurricanes and wildfires. Stop abusing brown/black people. Stop letting the obscenely rich roll over everyone.

Just do your thing. Let everyone else do ours.

5954 2018-11-14 14:59:21 Oil price stable? down $21 in juts a few weeks. Are we looking at the same charts?
5955 2018-11-14 14:59:18 Cuba try double cleansing. Not with cleansing oil but cleansing balm. Suit sensitive skin. Mine is combination n sensitive. Treat pimples then moisturise after.

5963 2018-11-14 14:58:50 หืมมมม
5964 2018-11-14 14:58:50 So I have a theory.
The reason Nigeria suffers from extreme blackouts is so that they can buy fuel for their generators at inflated prices from one company/entity that holds hella shares in most generator manufacturing & oil companies.

 Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
5965 2018-11-14 14:58:37 yeah it reminded me exactly of the "please be civil" rhetoric when asshole politicians were asked to leave restaurants awhile back 

my Big Oil thing was kinda a non sequitur but whatever. I just thought of it since the planet was involved. anyway AOC is my hero at the moment.
5966 2018-11-14 14:58:33 Some have vitamin C in too which are good, after this stage is when you wanna use your nice serums and moisturisers, I personally go for eye cream, then an oil then moisturiser (in that order so they all sink in) in the day I add a SPF bc retinols can leave your skin unprotected
5967 2018-11-14 14:58:33 This salad is one of the most delicious recipes when summer comes...it's flavorful, healthy and easy to prepare. And the best of everything: it is dressed with Spanish extra virgin olive oil!
5968 2018-11-14 14:58:27 It’s the cheapest vegetable oil around (so you know human greed wants in) that has a high melting point so it’s “easy” to use in a bunch of things like food, cosmetics, candles, detergents, and the list goes on. Best way to avoid it is just by checking the labels

5971 2018-11-14 14:57:59 Wash rinse repeat. IEA lowers est demand growth, which weighs on oil prices. Years later, IEA revises historical demand higher. When there is a legit supply-driven problem, the IEA will be complicit because it   constantly tries to drive prices, (hence capex), down.  #oil, #oott

a full 8 hours of uninterrupted, deep sleep. thankful for aromatherapy 
5978 2018-11-14 14:57:28 Red oil much better than processed vegetable oils.
5979 2018-11-14 14:57:27 Will never trust Tony Blair after what happened with his  WMD claims against Iraq and the chaos that followed. That country has been put into the dark ages again and the human cost has been phenomenal. Fighting an illegal war together with the then US President.  #Oil #War
5980 2018-11-14 14:57:24 Not the true picture. Plenty being done by palm oil plantation companies to ensure sustainable development. This very core principle being applied at brown and green fields. Need to understand palm oil's competition to understand the motive.

5987 2018-11-14 14:56:31 Why is "data the new oil"? Because with the cost of prediction dropping thanks to #AI the complement of data has become more valuable, even though we've been storing tons of data for decades, says @professor_ajay #Road2AI

5991 2018-11-14 14:56:22 @ShawnManaher a poor 77-year-old lady who was working for TCA to help with her oil bill had her account closed by Shawn because she dared to ask for her pay.  I might add she faithfully made money for him for nine years.

Yet it's happening to the other guy in almost every start. At some point, you have to give shooters credit

6005 2018-11-14 14:55:25 Ouch! Sorry to hear that. Something that can help with that is applying a household oil like baby oil or even olive oil to the tape before removing. The oil loosens the adhesive and should help the tape come off easier.

6023 2018-11-14 14:54:10 Thank you, I did more research and found the government wants the land for oil and gas. Which we already have plenty of digging grounds.  I'm so tired of land being taken away from native americans and wild animals for greed!

6043 2018-11-14 14:52:38 I voted no and I wanted it. Our city, province and country are all broke. We sit on a giant piggy bank of oil that could pay for this and a lot of other things, but instead handcuff ourselves with no pipelines to market.
6044 2018-11-14 14:52:34 New Mexico's largest private employment sector is Oil and Gas. New Mexico now has two senators, three representatives, governor and public land commissioner that are all extremely anti oil and gas. Think San Fran politicos. Sometimes elections make no sense.

6051 2018-11-14 14:51:40 Different times in my opinion. Abubakar handed over a fairly robust economy compared to 2015. Today the entire revenue of govt is virtually recurrent. With decreased oil revenues it would always be a challenge to move  the economy in the short term. Can be diff in medium term.
6052 2018-11-14 14:51:37 I can't get away from looking at the product and thinking 'fish oil tablet' because it sort of is (derived from it). Now if it was a single DAS and defined USP-grade excipients in a solid dose format, then yet, call it by the brand name.

6061 2018-11-14 14:50:43 Initial market open thoughts:  SPY tested 271 @ 4AM EST, and now at 274.  if 271 holds there is potential for reverse head and shoulders pattern supporting higher prices on a contra trend bear market rally.  275 is key resistance.  Oil is finally bouncing at major support.

6070 2018-11-14 14:49:38 It is always a matter of time. But how long? They won't pivot until credit bubbles are popped. They can't afford to. certainly not because stocks are down a tiny bit. Inflation has not been predictable in models for a decade, so don't conclude it won't show just up based on oil.

6115 2018-11-14 14:46:53 I look forward to the remaining installments.

Big piece still missing: court action to compel the culpable parties—govts & big oil—to clean up the mess they created & profited from.

Juliana v. US (@youthvgov) is one such case that we should support however we can.

6117 2018-11-14 14:46:50 By that standard, oil will run out in less than 50 years, gas in 53 years and coal in 67 years. Somehow fossil fuel companies are not panicking - and that is because proved reserves rise to meet demand, so proved resources is the wrong measure to estimate final carbon emissions.
6118 2018-11-14 14:46:49 I’ve actually done this. It works because of the liberal amount of oil in medium heat is basically frying the steak.

But, I don’t like the method because I’d rather have char with less oil of course. Like s good person.
6119 2018-11-14 14:46:47 Yes but suddenly Aliyev has got dementia and thinks that he and his late father built the city. He lives in fantasy land...too much oil has gone not only to his head but to his blood vessels unfortunately.

6125 2018-11-14 14:46:25 I’m all for demand reductions but we need supply constraints also. If the Dems take over after the 2020 election they need to stop leasing of federal lands for oil and gas production and block new pipelines.
6126 2018-11-14 14:46:21 The Taylor Energy Oil Spill has been going on since 2004, leaking approximately 700 barrels of oil into the ocean a day and this is my first time hearing about it. Wow.

-Demand has fallen 25%
-Global oil prices are down over 20% in a month
-The Kenya shilling is seriously losing ground

Is there anyone at ERC or Ministry of Energy with their brain still working?

Take care of your shit or your shit will brake and cost more. Replace filters and tires. Check you coolant and other fluid levels. Learn or have someone do it for you. 

Oil changes are not enough.
6133 2018-11-14 14:46:03 Maybe not the win - for certainly over and over in history they haven’t ever won but temporarily and to great expense - but denying them the platform to reach wider audiences protects the feeble minded just like it does from other potentially deadly snake oil peddlers.

You can also put on earrings too, I recommend some medium sized hoops
6161 2018-11-14 14:44:22 You rather have the middle class have less than 20% tank-to-wheel efficient vehicles. You prefer to have the middle class continue to waste 80% of each tank refill? Is that the world that the world you envision for your kids? Continuous dependence on oil and war? Really?
6162 2018-11-14 14:44:15 So u no like me
6163 2018-11-14 14:44:14 IER predicts oil demand to increase by at least 25% until 2040 or better. Fact is, production won't be declining at all. But without taxes, royalties etc. From this prodn. how do you expect to fund the green transition? Renewables are fuels of the wealthy, not economic at all.
6164 2018-11-14 14:44:12 next few days should be strong oil long natty short setup to unwind what is sure  a energy algo whore hedge fund that blew up. Still not time to go short natty because who knows what these IDIOTS have done
6165 2018-11-14 14:44:10 I spent my early years in South Texas living on oil leases. My Dad was a gager for an oil company he worked for until he retired. I have fond memories. I love all of Texas...except Midland. The place nearby named “No Trees” says it all!
6166 2018-11-14 14:43:49 The suggestion of UK Govt since Crosland days is not that Ork & Shet were indy but that the oil revenue could go to Westminster. Almost 50% from memory would end up in English coffers. Quell nationalism by saying oil would not go to Scotland.. Dependency does not cut it.

Kita tak boleh 100% kat occlusive je bcs dia tak boleh put in water back into the skin and, it can only seal things in. So kalau tak pakai any hydrating toners/essence/serum tetiba pakai oil pun tak jadi gak.
6171 2018-11-14 14:43:32 U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday, after consumer prices in  October rose as expected, keeping the Federal Reserve on track for  gradual interest rate hikes, while a rebound in oil prices lifted  energy stocks.

6192 2018-11-14 14:42:19 Actually bought some $CPG here...first oil/gas producer in a while. I think the sentiment washout on oil in general and Canada specifically has become as dire as practical with civilization still humming along.

Now we will see if this works...
6193 2018-11-14 14:42:17 Replace coconut oil with olive or avocado and we got something.
6194 2018-11-14 14:42:11 EYELASHES 
You can curl you eyelashes or even apply a little bit of mascara to give them more defining look
EYEBROWS 
You can trim your eyebrows and even style them, also using a LITTLE BIT of coconut oil can glow them and style them in place
6195 2018-11-14 14:42:00 Seriously that feels the best tho!! Plus fewer oil changes! You should bike in the summer cuz you'll be spending like nothing!!

Just because everyone got carried away the last few months thinking it was going sky high. Steady as she goes. $50-80 for ages now.  Enough.

6259 2018-11-14 14:36:39 You have one beautiful body and skin, Dbn has organic coconut oil so qhubeka nawo. No bleaching effect

6264 2018-11-14 14:36:16 You spread the table before me

6266 2018-11-14 14:36:15 Lots of us are saying it.  I got called an “oil executive” for saying it. 
6267 2018-11-14 14:36:07 Oga Sega, unfortunately, it will always be Love of Power as long as the Niger Delta oil is still flowing.

6268 2018-11-14 14:36:03 This afternoon I'm reading the wonderful @StripesBooks #ProudBook and it's knocking my socks off. Currently crying at @cynaesthete's story and also wishing I had a phoenix called Chilli Oil.
6269 2018-11-14 14:35:57 @TimW2312 was thinking, I went to blood & oil earlier in the year. They have a ‘Thug Life’ award for someone who gets wrecked during the event and can’t function. Do we need to get a Way of the Timmay one for SC next year...

6284 2018-11-14 14:34:33 When global oil prices are at 1-year low and petrol prices for Indian public is not.. this is the issue for next election not what someone said and in what context... grow up ppl!!!
6285 2018-11-14 14:34:33 Pretty neutral positioning now. I‘ll be long when the Barron‘s cover says „20 dollar oil“. They called for 100 dollar oil recently after all:)
6286 2018-11-14 14:34:29 It's not much of a savings to change your own oil anyhow. So long as you steer clear of the upsell.

6296 2018-11-14 14:33:40 Over the next few weeks oil will slowly claw back the losses of this week.

6299 2018-11-14 14:33:38 the difference is that a month ago oil was going to $100. Sterling has always been going to 1.2
6300 2018-11-14 14:33:34 I’m not necessarily sure I understand your slant. Are you insinuating tax breaks to oil companies (which many will call subsidies) are akin to federal funding of planned parenthood?

6302 2018-11-14 14:33:22 With CPI stable, oil prices falling, growth slowing, and equity market volatility, expect a minute change in Powell’s comments today, hinting the path of rate hikes may be paused if the economy stalls.

6308 2018-11-14 14:32:58 I don’t think the rate of unemployment can ever be as bad as it is now. We’ve always been an oil dependent country. Atiku’s regime saved Nigeria from the military and there was a boost in the establishment of private businesses especially in telecommunication.

6314 2018-11-14 14:32:14 Boots for tax evasion. Tunnocks, Cadbury's and Colgate for including palm oil in their products. Although the latter is a growing list.
6315 2018-11-14 14:32:11 Watch the next foreign policy moves from Russia, Saudi and Iran as a result of this downturn in oil prices
6316 2018-11-14 14:32:06 OPEC in general is running out of oil. Their cuts are about buying time not market share. They are hoping we tap out so the prices jump and they can benefit without reducing production. Most need much higher prices to support current needs.
6317 2018-11-14 14:31:53 Are these the same market fundamentals that make Oil Shale Producers want to make up for Cash Flow/bbl losses by increasing volume?
6318 2018-11-14 14:31:46 I have always been told to at least wait a few minutes to let the oil work up...
6319 2018-11-14 14:31:42 ***My gut feeling about Nov 19th***

Chef = Congress

6346 2018-11-14 14:29:32 I think my ratio of cocoa butter to Shea butter to coconut oil was too off. My diy lotion just smells like chocolate. Not that I’m complaining I like it and wanted it to small more like the cocoa but idk how well it’ll work now tho
6347 2018-11-14 14:29:25 Some pastors will buy and use every single drug you prescribe but give their members anointing oil or blessed water. Such nice, such wonderful.

6349 2018-11-14 14:29:14 True, but mayor countries need high prices to sustain their investments. plus US doesn't appreciate what his doing. hope Oil prices sustain under 80 for Brent and under 70 for USOil. that will maintain currencies at high but aceptable price.
6350 2018-11-14 14:29:14 @dr_organic can you tell me please if your products contain palm oil? Thank you
6351 2018-11-14 14:29:12 I put beard oil all over my face instead of face moisturizer. So thats how my morning is going so far hbu?
6352 2018-11-14 14:29:09 I think you are confusing "shitting on them" (when he bothers to turn up) with embarrassing himself and his country by displaying feckless ignorance and insulting representatives of our closest allies and largest trading partners. He's a snake oil salesman he cares for no one
6353 2018-11-14 14:29:07 Interesting stat I read last night:

After other crashes in oil (down 7% after already being down 15% in the past month), the S&P 500 was higher over the next two weeks 16/18 times (one loss was -0.5%).

Maybe some long opps in the next week or so?
6354 2018-11-14 14:29:05 Different situation. Alberta is hurting. Canada”s Energy issues are crushing that town. If oil was $100/ barrel this would be no brainer.  Don’t listen to the nay sayers, Look at HFX Wanders if you want the play book.
6355 2018-11-14 14:29:04 This is exactly why OPEC wants to cut production - to raise the price. Of course, we source most of our oil from Canada supplemented by what we drill so OPEC activities shouldn't affect us. But they will - any excuse by the oil industry to raise prices.

6360 2018-11-14 14:28:14 I feel like I'm pretty good about researching what oils to use... I know that I can't use it straight out of the bottle because it's too thick. My daughter can't use coconut oil because it makes her hair really dry but her hair loves tea tree oil.

6375 2018-11-14 14:27:02 You're gonna have to engage with the reality of  3rd way energy policy. "All of the above" under Obama meant massive expansion in natural gas production and huge investment of US money in gas and oil overseas. Time is up for environmentav tokenism.
6376 2018-11-14 14:27:00 Oh cool thanks bro!  I already take fish oil haven’t tried the others
6377 2018-11-14 14:26:38 Obama bailed out GM, how do you know she drives a GM car?
Actually the bailout was for the Auto workers Union, if Obama hadn't did that, GM would have reorganized and renegotiated their Union contracts. Tax write offs are not subsidies, the oil companies take advantage of tax law
6378 2018-11-14 14:26:36 Listening to these interviewees on @MorningEdition explaining how we can’t sanction the Saudis because we need them to produce oil while Iran is sanctioned. 

I mean, it’s almost like we should try not to be so dependent on fossil fuels.

6380 2018-11-14 14:26:26 Dear Sir,
Kindly compare the crude oil price reduction per barrel & then compare reduction in Petrol Prices in the same time window.
6381 2018-11-14 14:26:13 On that note, the guy over our fleet had to have the oil place we have an account with put "OIL CHANGES ONLY" in the comments field.  We've got over 200 vehicles and too many people were saying, "Well, hell, why not?  It's not MY money."

6383 2018-11-14 14:26:03 I understand the pain but don’t know about Atiku hvg Phd in improving economy. He was VP in 2004 when more Nigerians became poorer. We remained an oil dependent economy in 2015 as in 1999 when they came to power. Unemployment was increasing. High oil prices masked the issues.
6384 2018-11-14 14:25:59 Maybe he died....thats the only logic
6385 2018-11-14 14:25:57 It isn’t addictive if you take out the THC. Do a bit of research about CBD oil before you comment about things you don’t fully understand.
6386 2018-11-14 14:25:46 There is no gaurentee that the palm oil your suppliers are using is responsibly sourced produce. Needles to say, I will not buy another wrap from you again. I can make them at home with so many other oils. #SavetheOrangutan #palmoil #consumersaysno

6389 2018-11-14 14:25:23 It’s AMAZING lmao either fry it stovetop or roast it...fantastic. AND for added flavor simmer it in coconut oil  something about that when I don’t wanna use butter just amplifies the natural taste

6397 2018-11-14 14:24:56 Or: as many have noted, it's a huge fund unwinding a massive position of long oil/short nat gas - as *neither* has been following normal fundamentals for weeks, and the spread has gone parabolic.

Which, to me, certainly isn't based on "fundamentals"

6399 2018-11-14 14:24:53 Not many people in finance saying Trumponomics is great. Almost all are predicting recession during the Trump Presidency.  The Fed is out of touch, deficits starting to soar. Trade wars slowing global growth. Plunging oil prices and stocks.
6400 2018-11-14 14:24:50 they already discussed yesterday demand for oil is still strong. There's an oversupply currently with the big 3 producers at max levels. Stocks should be going up! I blame it on millennial hedge fund managers

6403 2018-11-14 14:24:43 Our area is often soggy and wet. California is often dry and on fire.  A water pipeline system would be nice.  I hear "impossible!" a lot.  But if it was oil, that pipeline would've been done decades ago.

6410 2018-11-14 14:24:19 U.S. stocks were set to open higher on Wednesday, after consumer prices in October rose as expected, keeping the Federal Reserve on track for gradual interest rate hikes, while a rebound in oil prices lifted energy stocks.
6411 2018-11-14 14:24:16 The oil concern is new for me.  I will ask me KAZ friend about that.  As for inventories that is a concern of mine.  Caameco says they need to maintain a min of 12 mil pounds.  This time last year they had 21 mil or so in inventory but w MRiver they cut down.
6412 2018-11-14 14:24:06 Earlier this year I got blasted for saying there was an interesting little inverse relationship between oil and gas.  I am pretty sure all the oil gamblers just jumped at natgas as an easy opportunity to make up losses from bad oil bets.
6413 2018-11-14 14:23:56 lets get something more substantial and insightful than this from the kidsounds like one of those silly TV ads on some exotic oil that you see being advertised on some of our third rate channels

6418 2018-11-14 14:23:28 The suggestion that Orkney and Shetland would be better off in UK being ruled from London than Edinburgh is flawed on matters relating to oil. Of that we are agreed.

6429 2018-11-14 14:22:30 #US Oct #CPI came at 2.5% y/y but core was up 2.1% y/y down from 2.2% last month. With lower oil and housing, CPI might not be rising as fast as some economists predict which probably means #FOMC doesn’t need to raise rates too quickly. 10 year treasuries at 3.15%.

6463 2018-11-14 14:19:39 I read earlier that they still have c. 200 products using palm oil on the shelf, so it's a pretty surface level effort so far. Can't wait for Vice to do the inevitable "I cooked Christmas dinner using palm oil products from Iceland" tear down

6478 2018-11-14 14:18:32 The geographical position of Yemen may have some effect on the oil price but in the current climate of oversupply it is minimal.

6516 2018-11-14 14:16:04 Very Funny. Oil talk is about sloshing and fluctuations due to abundance of the sticky stuff. This in the face of the END of oil for myriad reasons including the last drop, The second substantive sentence above is never uttered. Perish the thought. That is what is funny.

6648 2018-11-14 14:07:49 So one time I decided to look up how to make Grenadian oil down (since they sooooo pooooshy and can't comprehend that another island could have their own version).
And really the only major difference is that these people does literally add every single thing possible to the pot
6649 2018-11-14 14:07:46 To support all this climate change nonsense, one must NOT believe in the intelligent design of  the earth or the foreknowledge of God.

God MADE oil and gave us the brains to use it to man's advantage.

God is in control.

6651 2018-11-14 14:07:25 @Varneyco @FoxNews @FoxBusiness you guys over there talking about how good gas prices are now with oil barrels dropping, but California's gas in the largest most populous state is $3.40 plus a gallon. 
Report that on your show please!

6665 2018-11-14 14:06:22 So down stream use of the impact of oil use on the enviourment, can be a deal breaker,
But down stream impact of coal on the enviourment,
Is not ?
6666 2018-11-14 14:06:20 woke up to a startling thought: the strangest oil is baby oil
6667 2018-11-14 14:06:19 India is probably the only country in the world where the price of Petrol at the pump has gone up despite a fall in the World price of oil…
6668 2018-11-14 14:06:19 @CNBC @chasepointer74 Lots of talk about crashing oil prices this week...Strangely no mention that the media generally ridiculed Trump 2-3 months ago for saying he was arranging with Saudi Arabia and Russia to offset Iranian crude when the sanction went into place last Friday.

Banning flavours is massively negligent for any govt.
6672 2018-11-14 14:06:12 For thinning hair, we recommend Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner, along w/ Tea Tree Eucalyptus Treatment Oil. While we don't make medical claims, the medicinal properties of tea tree oil are naturally stimulating to the scalp & may help encourage healthy hair growth.  ~BB
6673 2018-11-14 14:06:09 Completely agree with your comments, the focus should be on sustainable palm oil. In producing countries millions of farmers work within the sector. Palm oil plays an important role in reducing poverty in these areas.
6674 2018-11-14 14:06:08 Liberal/Progressive overreach (tyranny) is the reason for the 2A. Seizing the people's firearm would make their utopian police state much easier.

6677 2018-11-14 14:05:51 Thanks. We're v.aware of issues surrounding palm oil & careful consideration is given to the use of it in our foods. No plans at mo to reduce but the safety of our foods is top priority & we carry out extensive research & assessments on all the ingredients we use in our foods....

6685 2018-11-14 14:05:13 And yet, even after they murdered and chopped up a Washington Post reporter & are literally starving millions of ppl to death in Yemen, you want to sell them billions of $ of weapons. Their actions only matter to you if they affect the price of oil?  You’re disgusting.
6686 2018-11-14 14:05:12 You know what, I have a 10acre oil palm farm with a dream to make it bigger to at least 100acres. Guess what, I am stucked, money! Farming no be easy at all.
6687 2018-11-14 14:05:08 This is terrible cause the hot oil will soak out of the bread into the hands.

6695 2018-11-14 14:04:38 Thanks, that is good to hear. I'd hate to have to look for different products.

6702 2018-11-14 14:04:16 Think about it. America is getting a 30 million a day discount on Canadian oil because Canada can't get enough oil to world market.American interests are behind environmental protest stopping Trans Mountain Pipe Line. #thirtyMillionAday

6711 2018-11-14 14:03:42 Oil prices dropped to their lowest level in over eight months amid fears about a slowdown in demand. International benchmark Brent crude dropped almost 7% to US$65.11 a barrel, its lowest level since March.

Iran is top dog today. Why?
GW Bush, in destroying Iraq, empowered Iran
Obama aided Iran further:
-Pulled US troops from Iraq too early
-Supported PM Maliki; Iran's surrogate
-Delivered JCPOA
-Derailed Narcoterrorism probe into Hezbollah
-Gave Syria to Iran

6727 2018-11-14 14:02:55 A lot of people are debating that. It probably is getting more coverage, but I think the key messages lose some impact this way - are people talking about the ban instead of the deforestation caused by using palm oil?
6728 2018-11-14 14:02:52 There was nothing competent about Obama. He was a snake oil salesman whose sole purpose was to divide the country. Because liberals only care about rhetoric and economic pipe dreams, they bought his (and the media’s) lies hook, line and sinker.

6759 2018-11-14 14:00:26 Quite right, there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil, it goes in the same box as clean coal. The Indonesian Government has for years tried to maintain that it's production was sustainable, even creating a sham certification. Avoid.

It ws like turning on a light switch. Kannaway's CBD is organic,high potentency. You may have to take a lot of it at first.

6775 2018-11-14 13:59:25 Big oil companies, will, and r becoming Big Energy companies by diversifying (analyst on bloomberg surveillance mentioned) cuz the future is not oil. However, assuming that world living standard conts up, demand for oil will persist. But countries who can, must move away from oil

6778 2018-11-14 13:58:59 Actually what needs to happen is nationalize the oil industry and phase it out over 10 years while installing renewables. Big Oil will absolutely not give up voluntarily. They will cling to their profits until you pry it from their hands. So start prying now while we still can.
6779 2018-11-14 13:58:47 I do hope they discuss what happens to the indigenous ppl when the income generated by palm oil disappears & they're back to not being able to feed or educate their kids. They are not ignorant of the long term effects of deforestation.  But they are desperate & need our help now!

6781 2018-11-14 13:58:30 That's because since #Reagan we've bought the snake oil that helping all businesses helps the economy as a whole. There's a big difference between regional #capitalism and global capitalism. Small business can help a community large scale corporations really only #dominate
6782 2018-11-14 13:58:19 نہیں میرا نہیں خیال،حکومت چاہتی تو ہے کہ Palm Oil مِل جائے مگر وہ شدت نہیں کہ ملے ہی ملے، اِس سے کہیں زیادہ حکومت اس بات پر غور کررہی ہے کہ خلیجی ممالک قطر اور عرب امارات سے کچھ وقت کیلیئے ڈالرز ملِ جائیں اور ساتھی ہی درآمدات برآمدات لوکل کرنسی میں ہو، دیکھیں کتنا کامیاب ہوتے ہیں
6783 2018-11-14 13:58:16 Hi Laura, the RSPO certification is helping to transform the Palm Oil industry and ensure that companies are producing and trading sustainably. Hope this helps.
6784 2018-11-14 13:58:13 They won’t since Sweden is a oil importing states means no oil revenue so they need their citizen to not start a rebellion a.k.a need them to be as alive; connected & expert/ polymaths.

6796 2018-11-14 13:57:37 Thanks - very encouraging - but some consumers might want to switch away from palm oil immediately. Would be helpful if @WOOLWORTHS_SA offered palm oil free alternatives and labeled them clearly.
6797 2018-11-14 13:57:25 Okay, I need help. Is CBD oil illegal or not?? My son’s developmental doc said that she cannot recommend giving it to him for his behaviors (he is diagnosed ASD) because it’s illegal. But I can drive 5 mins away and buy it legally! HELP!! #CBD #help

6814 2018-11-14 13:55:40 Assuming that the facts r right, I agree w his points. Oil is destructive and we should be moving away from it at a faster pace for that reason. It's also archaic. It helped industrialize the world, no need to go back n regret, but definitely we need to look forward.

6907 2018-11-14 13:48:31 Changed his tune? Buffett has always dissed conservative policy and championed Democrats. “It was more about eight years of bad policy before [Obama] got there,” Buffett said of GWB in 2010. “It was Dracula running the blood bank in terms of oil and leases.”

6910 2018-11-14 13:48:25 @HotelChocolat can@you advise if you use palm oil in your chocolate and is it sustainable?

6912 2018-11-14 13:48:12 Yes, oil companies were loss making but now it is profit making bcoz subsidy on fuels are removed n lot of support given. Looks like Ur struck with policies prior 2014 n applying to present govt.

6914 2018-11-14 13:47:56 My kids loved the school lunches. Not everyone likes tater tots, palm oil, nitrate laced meat, and those glorious canned vegetables. Obesity is popular in red states. What's your diet, Red Bull and Buicks?
6915 2018-11-14 13:47:56 I understand that westminster has taken 92% of scots oil for 50+ years
That`s over 500 BILLION and yet UK is still near bankrupt.

6919 2018-11-14 13:47:34 On paper the BN budget is better than Pakatan. At least they had a better cash transfer program. No oil subsidy either.
6920 2018-11-14 13:47:33 The UK is exactly like that, as it has wasted the opportunity the Oil & Gas revenues offered and has very little to show for it, except a small cluster of billionaires, rising poverty, abuse of the ill/disabled, spiralling homelessness and food banks.
It's as if we never had any.
6921 2018-11-14 13:47:28 In the past you’ve mentioned that you don’t smoke weed, but you should try CBD oil. There’s no THC so you won’t get high, but the anxiety should be greatly diminished. I believe you can order it from the government website. It will really help.
6922 2018-11-14 13:47:24 There was almost no inflation in October unrelated to Energy or used cars. Since then oil has collapsed. Jay.. you out there?
6923 2018-11-14 13:47:18 
6924 2018-11-14 13:47:17 Missing the point of an armed public is to ensure no Government regulation is acceptable. Government should not be involved, hence the "shall not be infringed" in the 2nd. It's like the oil companies setting the  fuel economy standards for cars. Come one folks dive deeper.

6929 2018-11-14 13:46:38 if we don't have any inflation now after a massive stimulus plus tariffs do you think we will have any in the future after the dramatic fall in crude... also US ISM will be pressured as activity slows in the oil patch just a matter of time before the Fed becomes more dovish

6971 2018-11-14 13:42:16 by tradition, I agree, just pointing out that the most recent experience suggested oil price declines weren't a net contributor to GDP. US energy sector now much bigger after all.

The eu has already formed an axis of power with the oil rich countries of the ME and Africa to subvert the power of nato and the usa.They are producing an internal army to stop dissent Thats a USSR
6975 2018-11-14 13:41:58 Saudi or any MEast cntry don't need fincl aid. They hv so much oil wealth but their economy&fincl mkts are not connected to global network nor produce anything else. US has control of financial markets&can stop intl txns but KSA is too imp&US will nvr impose sanctions

7015 2018-11-14 13:38:07 So your whole Orkney and Shetland mimi argument (that Scots will not get oil so too poor to leave) is shot to flames because you did not engage the thought process and read up on it. Pathetic. Enclaves get nothing in law. Look at Channel Islands as a guideline.

7052 2018-11-14 13:35:14 Yes, 100%. I think the advert wouldn't have interested anyone if it went into the intricate pros and cons instead, a hard hitting, tug on the emotional heartstrings ad did the trick! Average Joe is not going to completely stop using products with palm oil because it's ubiquitous

7055 2018-11-14 13:35:12 I used to have migraines. I got a Ayurvedic medicine from Munnar Kerala. I bought that oil and applied it on my temple and on top my head for 15 continuous days and that really cured it for me. I still have coffee every day i get headaches but not more migraines.

7057 2018-11-14 13:35:04 44 Billion barrels of oil in the last forty years.

The war in Yemen has much more to do with the Sunni/Shia conflict.
7061 2018-11-14 13:34:52 does anyone know if i am allowed to bring CBD oil with no THC in it to Hong Kong?! So confused :/ @afterprohibends @End_Our_Pain #cannabisoil
7062 2018-11-14 13:34:44 @CadburyUK please stop using Palm oil. U are the worst offenders and I enjoy your product. I’m not eating any foods with it in unless it’s sustainable!
7063 2018-11-14 13:34:42 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.

7092 2018-11-14 13:31:47 so you're in favor of Iran taking over the chokepoint of a massive oil shipping route the Straits of Mandeb ?

7164 2018-11-14 13:24:44 Did you read them?

For the last three decades, including 16 years of Democrat administrations, including 8 under Obama that were crucial, the US actively blocked, diluted, & sabotaged global efforts to combat climate change, while building a massive domestic oil industry.
7165 2018-11-14 13:24:35 OIL: Oil rose towards $67 a barrel, recouping some of the previous session's slide, on the growing prospect of OPEC and allied producers cutting output at a meeting next month to prop up the market.
7166 2018-11-14 13:24:32 We favour our strengths, and avoid looking where we cannot see clearly...

Eg. Oil brings wealth *and* reliance on Oil. With deficit of $25.9bn expected for next fiscal year, Kuwait is looking to boost economy as matter of urgency. 

But does it know how to be urgent?

7188 2018-11-14 13:21:36 These look great and so good that they don't contain palm oil #saynotopalmoil
7189 2018-11-14 13:21:35 Stable (Security) Steady income (Revenue) the all fit into that sir. Only  Kwankwaso (2nd term) and Dankwambo experienced Boko Haram crisis but in terms of revenue they both were privileged to experience the best of oil boom. Do the maths.

7192 2018-11-14 13:21:26 U.S. crude oil output from seven major shale basins was expected to hit a record of 7.94M bpd in Dec. The total oil output from the basins was expected to rise 113K bpd, driven largely by increases in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.
7193 2018-11-14 13:21:21 Using $TOU as a lead indicator for oil sector .. it looks to rock today.
7194 2018-11-14 13:21:17 The question is... how much US government have to rely on tax revenue?
Answer: 75% of it.
US will be a democracy until somehow US export 100 MBPD of oil without turning the price into 0$/.
7195 2018-11-14 13:21:09 Latest Opec figures suggest #Venezuela's oil production could fall as low as 500,000 bpd next year, down from 1.17m bpd in October, which was the lowest monthly production rate in Venezuela for 30 years.
7196 2018-11-14 13:21:07 Oil & coal, soooo last century

7198 2018-11-14 13:20:56 Futures were higher this morning amid volatility in the oil market and as investors looked ahead to inflation data. The Dow saw its third straight negative session on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 saw its fourth straight negative session.
7199 2018-11-14 13:20:47 I'm not disputing the endangerment of orangs; we also have to consider the effect of a bam on #palmoil on food security. You know how important palm oil is. All we can do is take palliative measures to mitigate the dangers and foster sustainable palm oil.
7200 2018-11-14 13:20:45 Man you watch more games than most Oil fans!  Good for you.  #teamslegit #bigfan #bleedoil #bornandraised

7203 2018-11-14 13:20:32 I hear bio oil works wonders

7206 2018-11-14 13:20:29 Russia's energy minister said on Wednesday no emergency action was warranted to stem a decline in oil prices. Alexander Novak reports in Singapore that long-term oil prices should be taken into consideration when any decision was taken by oil producing countries.
7207 2018-11-14 13:20:26 yes, and Mondolez (which includes Cadbury) just got exposed for really poor palm oil trading. I've moved all their products onto our red list.

$chk, is a huge question mark by getting themselve by in the $oil game again
7209 2018-11-14 13:20:10 I bought Sainsbury's margarine that stated palm oil was responsible sourced. We need more of this information on food items.

7212 2018-11-14 13:19:53 Trump is long nat gas, short oil
7213 2018-11-14 13:19:50 White journalists ur known for advancing lies to advance imperialism. U told us about Iraqi WMDs that didn’t exist & Gaddaffi needing to go to make Libya better. Today we know u lied for oil. So why haven’t u pushed 4 autopsy & ballistic reports to prove Zim troops shot pple?
7214 2018-11-14 13:19:49 Started positions in $CJ, $CR, and $TCW .. oil and natgas starter pack.
7215 2018-11-14 13:19:46 I'm not sure now is a good time. Global oversupply pushes our oil to the back of the line even further. If this persists oilcos will be booking big losses. Even integrateds could take a big market hit. WCS is at depression levels (basically giving it away).
7216 2018-11-14 13:19:42 He also was friends with Munnings. A few years ago, I was visiting newlyweds around Christmas and was captivated by a small oil painting in the entranceway. The husband, whose last name was Munnings, beamed and said it was by a great-uncle--a renowned English painter.

7218 2018-11-14 13:19:22 £5 and £10 notes contain animal fat, I've heard that for the £20 note they want to replace animal fat with palm oil and do the same for reprints of £5 and £10 notes. But unfortunately, money is something we can not avoid our whole lives 
7219 2018-11-14 13:19:22 Oil prices have fallen sharply since passing a cyclical peak at the start of October, amid surging production and mounting concerns about the state of the global economy and the outlook for consumption growth in 2019.
7220 2018-11-14 13:19:21 #OOTT Oil's recent plunge is 'made in Washington,' Citigroup said. “While factors well beyond oil are responsible for the latest selloff, fingers could be pointed at the U.S., where President Trump’s recent tweet about OPEC is just one of many ‘made in Washington’
7221 2018-11-14 13:19:20 Scotland soon will not have any oil left either
7222 2018-11-14 13:19:18 呼ばれた気がした！！！
7223 2018-11-14 13:19:17 Tea tree oil 
7224 2018-11-14 13:19:15 It has been also a political correct strategy to be long oil and short gas as this benefits the US economy/ shale industry the most. This strategy tipped due to the mid term election.
7225 2018-11-14 13:19:14 $EAST "Formed an LLC in Kentucky as the preliminary step in a partnership with an affiliate of established agricultural company, Caudill Seed, to produce high-grade CBD hemp oil as an ingredient.,, first step in Eastside developing a U.S. sourced CBD for use in beverages"

7227 2018-11-14 13:19:08 Thought that's what you meant with biore - but what I'm saying is that once I stopped using facial cleansers for acne, my acne went away. Because the products are designed to lift dirt & oil to the surface of your skin. I just use hot water & no soaps & my skin doesn't act up now
7228 2018-11-14 13:18:59 Look at vegan ones too. They’re palm oil free

7235 2018-11-14 13:18:25 Petrol price will reduce on its own with falling oil prices. Centre won't cut. 

May be TN state govt can cut it from the 34% it charges as state VAT.
7236 2018-11-14 13:18:05 Let's fund cleaner energy with that subsidy money instead of oil.
7237 2018-11-14 13:18:03 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.
7238 2018-11-14 13:17:59 If I have to oil you to make you look good, I'll do it.

You look like you fell out of a desert. You're thinking your aesthetic is friendly, softer. 

 I say parched. Dehydrated. Biscuity. Old rope. 

Scarecrow in a wonderbra. Fix it.
7239 2018-11-14 13:17:57 Thanks to the politicians your industry has purchased, renewable energy sources have been shelved in favor of your dirty, climate-ruining oil. (Interacting to cost you $$)
7240 2018-11-14 13:17:56 To carry on with the Dad theme. I took him to Canadian Tire for his birthday.

Me: I said something shiny
Dad: Oil is shiny
Me : Eye roll

7244 2018-11-14 13:17:35 Sure. So then let's stop subsidizing oil too and let it sort it out that way. I'm okay with that.

7248 2018-11-14 13:17:01 $ung is a play on natural gas - stock was around $100 with $8 gas in 2014    #sunspots - cold winter hedge. Traders were short not gas and long oil so trade has unwinded.
7249 2018-11-14 13:16:48 And how about palm oil? What’s your current policy on that?
7250 2018-11-14 13:16:40 Well, yes that's true.  In a more perfect world, we would all be cooking our own seasonal, locally sourced, organic foods and the demand for processed foods would whither away.  We'd still need vegetable oils in some form though and oil palm is, well, very oily.
7251 2018-11-14 13:16:37 Hi Laura, all palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.
7252 2018-11-14 13:16:26 this whole move in oil nat gas has been gapping higher daily, i figured it was just an algo pair trade.  a big fund being short ng and long CL, kind of makes sense given recent moves ahead of HF redemption day, but i guarantee you alot of it was momo algo's doing a pair trade

7257 2018-11-14 13:16:14 Lol but he stated a fact there not an axiom, even Mr Obi can't deny
7258 2018-11-14 13:16:12 Palm oil in so much of our food. Time for manufacturers to take responsibility and tell us from who & where they source it & put that on the labels. 
I don't have an Iceland Store nearby and I'm not in delivery area.
7259 2018-11-14 13:16:07 What leader from any party would bring in bill C 69 or for that matter delay any export of a resource that benefits to the world if the government wants to stop export of oil buyout the oil companies and stop developing oil GOOD LUCK WITH THAT

7263 2018-11-14 13:15:49 Trump tried to intervene at least 3 times in oil market already this year, market totally ignored him when it wasn't aligned with fundamentals. Now fundamentals finally caught up. Nothing to do with Trump whatsoever.
7264 2018-11-14 13:15:38 Here are 3 ways for women to close ''wage gap'': 1) take STEM or business instead of gender studies; 2) Work in construction or oil, not retail; 3) Don't take time off for kids
7265 2018-11-14 13:15:37 これloftにあったりする？
7266 2018-11-14 13:15:34 Any truth that bond funds were responsible for buying up the price of oil, influencing higher inflation readings and then getting higher rates/yields....and now have been subsequently blasted?
7267 2018-11-14 13:15:32 Did you put but butter or oil on the dough first, or just straight up cheese?

7274 2018-11-14 13:15:04 The UK are removing investment and subsidies as part o the union. Just ask the people of Peterhead! Scotland has resources which most countries would cut there hand of for. The UK gov have wasted the Oil industry and now doing the sane to renewables

7279 2018-11-14 13:14:42 Thankfully gas prices differ by region & UK gas prices are certainly not putting in anything like that move. Trump / US attempting to reduce the oil price has coincided with a spike in Nat Gas lol

7283 2018-11-14 13:14:34 I recommend the hot toddy approach for a sore throat/early cold symptoms. Add hot water, lemon and honey to the whiskey. If you can handle it, adding a tablespoon of mild flavored olive oil will help coat the throat as well.
7284 2018-11-14 13:14:33 The oil of an apology will heal a lot of friction.
7285 2018-11-14 13:14:32 Gas has been held down for the last few years by traders representing powerful corporations who want cheap gas. This is what happens when you cap price using HFT it works until it doesn't. You might be right about the trade but the hit on oil feels very suspicious/political to me
7286 2018-11-14 13:14:30 Aka mineral oil.
7287 2018-11-14 13:14:28 The problem is for anyone attempting to buy these spreads, if Stocks or oil continues, you're going to take a huge amount of heat and maybe be forced out

7289 2018-11-14 13:14:20 Hey Tzeporah is that the tar sands in California? Because Alberta has oil sands and we are the most responsible & ethical oil producer globally. We set an environmental standard for the rest of the world. Tell me who is as ethically responsible as we are please

7291 2018-11-14 13:13:49 Surging shale; trade-war-related demand concerns; Iran waivers; OPEC+ output hikes (partly pressured by tweets, NOPEC). It seems the US has collapsed the oil price. #OOTT

7293 2018-11-14 13:13:35 Calgary survives (today) on oil/gas. In case you’ve been under a rock, the general mood in this city is doom and gloom with no end in site. Combined with a “half baked” process from Nenshi and co., plus zero faith in provincial (Notley) and Federal (Turdeau) leaders = HARD NO

7295 2018-11-14 13:13:32 @Ocasio2018 Hi, Alexandria.
I'm nobody, just a guy in Huntsville, AL. But I'm pondering politics too...  can we research the plastic-to-oil machine, and better still, the 11× more efficient "golden sandwich" solar panel concepts from Japan, and get ideas like these popular again?
7296 2018-11-14 13:13:29 The USA can always be relied upon to be there for our allies (not like O) as seen by his stand with Israel, strengthening of NATO, giving weapons to the Ukraine to protect themselves from Russia, encouraging Germany to not rely on Russia for oil, increasing our oil and nat gas

7301 2018-11-14 13:12:57 適当すぎてわらう
7302 2018-11-14 13:12:53 Not sure what you mean.  Iceland have had a perfectly good ad banned because it shows how damaging producing palm oil is to nature.  Hope this helps.  If I've misunderstood you - sorry.

7306 2018-11-14 13:12:39 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
7307 2018-11-14 13:12:26 It's difficult to convince doubters because snake oil salesmen like you are peddling nonsense and keeping the gullible in bronze age mythology. All for the promise of love from a deity that isn't there.

7317 2018-11-14 13:11:38 3 Hours ago! Wall Street set for lower open amid oil volatility; inflation data in focus.
7318 2018-11-14 13:11:37 As Macron and the rest of Europe join them and oppose the USA because we want them to pay their fair share. Just the fact that they were going to buy Russian Oil says it all! 
Oh! They still do business with Iran too! Yet they pretend they’re on our side...

7322 2018-11-14 13:11:13 Lads. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a crushing defeat. I can't come to poker tonight.
7323 2018-11-14 13:11:10 Ogoni clean up exercise is a project being implemented by this Government. If you know how much problem oil spill has been in that area, you'll not deny the importance of that project. Go and ask the citizens from that region how much that will be of benefit to them

7327 2018-11-14 13:11:03 Except each vote still counts as one & all votes are counted in a democracy- especially overseas military mail in ballots- you know the veterans y’all wave around for patriotic propaganda purposes & send to die to fight for oil but never seem to honor or even fund VA?
7328 2018-11-14 13:11:01 #OPEC+ discuss -1.4 mbd next year. This amount (at least) is needed to keep mkt tight in 2019. Any reduction below that number is bearish. But OPEC will remain a support for #oil prices. Keep an eye on #Russia #OOTT
7329 2018-11-14 13:10:48 America needs to get away from oil & coal dependency. If only we could get clean energy to expand as rapidly as tech does in America we would be set for many years to come.

7333 2018-11-14 13:10:40 I am long a 1/2 position in DGAZ. My entry was $3.86  Going into options expiration this Friday you know a shift is about to happen with oil and nat gas.

7335 2018-11-14 13:10:36 I mean is this even up for discussion? Eru is a waste or resources especially palm oil.
7336 2018-11-14 13:10:27 Not sure where it falls under vitamin/supplements... oil of oregano. It's currently keeping a cold at bay. I take it 3x a day.

7338 2018-11-14 13:10:12 Not quite sure he DIDN'T understand them either. But low oil prices squeeze Iran and mean cheaper gas prices for Americans. 

We all know stock prices come and go. He definitely knows that. He very well could be playing them.
7339 2018-11-14 13:10:11 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。

7341 2018-11-14 13:10:04 It's a sign for an oil company, and not even the original sign. Nice work.
7342 2018-11-14 13:10:04 I love wawa sandwiches but particularly the Philly Cheesesteak is awful... they have the wrong recipe trying to copy the nasty Pats. It's easy: squeeze all the water first from the meat, add sauté onions, drip extra virgin olive oil and cover with provolone cheese on top. Voilà!!
7343 2018-11-14 13:09:53 @Oreo Hello, I wanted to know when you will stop to use plam oil in your products, as the palm oil you use from Wilmar company also generate deforestation ? #oreo #PalmOil #PalmOilFree #Deforestation #ClimateAction

7345 2018-11-14 13:09:42 With crash in Oil prices (plus very low inflation), the one and only major trigger for anti incumbency against Modi /BJP guvt is gone 
BJP could still lose 2019 but that will not be due to anti incumbency but other factors only !
7346 2018-11-14 13:09:34 Oil prices world over has gone the lowest this year for the consecutive 13 days.
7347 2018-11-14 13:09:31 Wow two reasons now to boycott @nestle contributing to the divisive news of @FoxNews and using palm oil which is destroying precious habitat and causing the extinction of orangutans. @OrangutanC @OrangutanFndn @redapes @orangutanku

7350 2018-11-14 13:09:22 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
7351 2018-11-14 13:09:21 I know the modellers will disagree with me on this (and perhaps you), but I think showing the median has quite some value (over the use of illustrative outliner scenarios). Today I saw someone portraying P4 as what could happen to oil, without realising it is an outlier. /end
7352 2018-11-14 13:09:20 Why is gasoline so high & crude oil prices keep getting lower ?!? someone should invent the #microrefinery soon  a barrel of oil & a tank of gas almost same price #wherethatconversationat? #360
7353 2018-11-14 13:09:18 I personally think that the Autistic community are missing a trick.. The CBD oil is well advertised and sold openly in shops everywhere.. but to smoke or vape CBD flowers can give instant anxiety relief. Some strains are better than others..
7354 2018-11-14 13:09:04 Oil Futures fall, exactly what business & those asking for US producers to accomplish by increasing supply, and the speculators and market watchers start freaking out that the sky is falling.  The market doesn't like Democrat threats...they are the blame for a "looming recession"
7355 2018-11-14 13:09:03 It was weird it my stock scanner showed an SEC filing was filed yesterday answering questions about the mineral oil.  But, when I go to the SEC website there is no filings.

7365 2018-11-14 13:08:14 Thanks for covering the Iceland ad, I liked how you told both sides of the issue. Rang-tan's story is important and needs to be told. HOWEVER, Iceland's decision to remove palm oil and promote such a move as the right thing to do is irresponsible and belittled the 10 years + 1/2
7366 2018-11-14 13:08:04 I agree. They do not get value for money in my opinion. They are absolute vassal states. Norway I suppose don't care too much due to their sovereign wealth/oil funds.

7370 2018-11-14 13:07:56 Nigeria's oil and gas sector is always going to attract FDI from the West - sales are in dollars & that sector doesn't depend on Nigeria's dilapidated infrastructure.

But that sector's contribution to job growth and the overall economy is declining.

7384 2018-11-14 13:06:19 akuu langsung sambung sih dr toner ke oil face.

Tapi kamu pake 2 toner sekaligus ga buat mukamu kering banget ya? Aku pake some by me aja sudah kering
7385 2018-11-14 13:06:14 Completely agree with this. The land required to feed and house 56 billion animals every year is a much bigger cause of deforestation than palm oil. Changes can be made for both issues directly at home: cut your meat consumption and source products that use sustainable palm oil

7392 2018-11-14 13:05:49 The original layered figure to me, shows what are the strong and consistent signals across scenarios. They all show strong declines in coal, mixed story for oil and gas, strong growth in non-fossil. Etc. There are some (very few) scenarios with low bio.

7445 2018-11-14 13:00:49 I think in India, its 15 day DMA that determines the oil price. its reducing every day. 2 days back, price remain same here. so, in India no change in price. but yesterday, brent dropped by 4$ and WTI by more than 3$. so prices will decrease.

7450 2018-11-14 13:00:30 Can you explain why you think that a very resource rich country like scotland cant be indy?

7489 2018-11-14 12:56:26 I fermented it for 24 hours. Washed it once a week. I let the rice water soak in my hair for about 2-3 hours before I washed it out. Then I put Jamaican castor oil on my hair after the rice water was all washed out

7516 2018-11-14 12:54:11 I think the move here is to replicate the trade once you think the unwind is done. Long oil. Short nat gas. Preferably with options, maybe USO/UNG options into april or maybe shorter dated into dec

7589 2018-11-14 12:46:37 Except the estimated orangutan population has quadrupled since 1998 from 27,000 to now 100,000 while palm oil has expanded. Google it.
7590 2018-11-14 12:46:28 Maybe I should work on oil rigs when I get out
7591 2018-11-14 12:46:24 Thanks for the color! Seems consistent w/ what I've observed and I think it makes for a "this time is different" story on the oil price collapse that people are too shellshocked to assert right now.
7592 2018-11-14 12:46:22 キャス龍はなんかあれクソデカ感情とかじゃなくて「わーい！たーのしー！きみは最高のCOOOOOOLを見せてくれるふれんずなんだね！」って感じだからホッコリするよね(R18G)！！！！！
7593 2018-11-14 12:46:13 I put all the oil from a vitamin E pill on my face now I’m looking like a grease monkey 
7594 2018-11-14 12:46:10 I have cod liver oil & raw garlic everything morning and it doesn’t get easier 
7595 2018-11-14 12:46:00 Q: Here is your New Aston Martin, Bond. It comes with Flame Throwers, Oil Slick Generators, Ejector Seats and special cubby holes to put the nappies and wet wipes.
7596 2018-11-14 12:45:55 These paid short trolls are trying to protect their OTC fish oil supplement business because of the threat from Vascepa. The data is clear on epa+dha mixtures - they have never shown reduction in cardiac events. Only EPA like vascepa is effective #AMRN

7598 2018-11-14 12:45:37 @deciemchatroom Do you use Palm Oil in any of your products? If so is it from a sustainable source? What is the corporate policy with regard to Palm Oil?  Thanks
7599 2018-11-14 12:45:35 Agreed. Let's build the trans-Canadian oil and gas Pipeline NOW.
In 30 years we can convert the pipeline to transport wheat!
7600 2018-11-14 12:45:35 The sweet smell of fried hair and ORS olive oil spray early in the morning 
7601 2018-11-14 12:45:23 Wolf...you are either taking the mick or serious.
Who knows with you lot.
7602 2018-11-14 12:45:17 Stk mkts(-) led by oil companies amid significant crude oil price decline yesterday, as well as concerns that Italy turned in a defiant budget proposal to the European Commission. Mkts focused today on US CPI & #JPowell speech
7603 2018-11-14 12:45:09 You are focused on oil.  Check out natural gas.

7605 2018-11-14 12:44:52 I did. "Garnish" is different  "Garnishee".  Is PDP stupid? PDP cant spell! And you want to govern? No wonder u cannot account for trillion dollars earned from sale of Oil between 2000 to 2015. VAMPIRES! YOU ARE NOT COMING BACK. PDP, BAD FOR NIGERIA! HELL NO! #NigeriaDecides2019
7606 2018-11-14 12:44:43 Just received my fabulous prize from @OliveBranchFood ... already tasted the 3 honeys - delightful! The flavours invoke wonderful memories of Greek holiday sunshine. Can't wait to try the olive oil later. Thank you 
7607 2018-11-14 12:44:29 Another lame accuse how about taking responsibility and handling the situation as real workers we have to resolve situations obviously you guys don’t by the way speedway says thanks for the business! In case anyone forgot BP caused the largest oil spill in American history!
7608 2018-11-14 12:44:29 One of the big winners of lower oil prices will be Turkey - each $10 a barrel cut in oil price typically saves Turkey around 0.4% of GDP on the CAD and inflation, says @tashecon #turkey #oilprice
7609 2018-11-14 12:44:26 @Aldi_Ireland in light of @Greenpeace report yesterday about the impact palm oil production is having on species & habitat loss, particularly in Malaysia, do you have or plan to have a policy to remove palm oil from your products similar to @IcelandFoods.
7610 2018-11-14 12:44:25 Any with a dubious connection to palm oil production
7611 2018-11-14 12:44:21 With its vast agricultural potential, #Africa’s agribusiness sector is predicted to reach $1 trillion by 2030. #Agribusiness will become the ‘new oil” on the continent, #AfricanInvestmentForum participants said, fueling the motor of #inclusivegrowth.
7612 2018-11-14 12:44:20 My Bloomberg machine must be broken. It’s showing #oil up today.
7613 2018-11-14 12:44:17 TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, or the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.
7614 2018-11-14 12:44:16 i agree with Adrian. Im sorry but making up all your cartoon names isnt going to get the oil flowing at Angus. All a bit pathetic really.
Look forward to your tanker updates Adrian. 
7615 2018-11-14 12:44:10 Agreed! Oil,coal, and Big pharma lobbyists aren’t going to like you.
7616 2018-11-14 12:44:08 And anyways, what exactly would the the quid pro quo from these American oil companies be, exactly?  American refineries like the situation as it is. The pipeline companies are Canadian & there are hardly any US companies in oil sands production

These are simply cheap shots
7617 2018-11-14 12:44:05 I'm super impress dengan tea tree oil
7618 2018-11-14 12:44:00 You will never get up to $100 again. Maybe around $80 on average next year?
7619 2018-11-14 12:43:59 I’ve tried everything here except the Neutrogena oil. I even have a bottle of Vaseline lotion in the office drawer. Maybe I’ll try Johnson’s oil gel

7624 2018-11-14 12:43:43 sold oil long 5640. 46 pips enough for me in oil. looking to buy lower ideally sub 56
7625 2018-11-14 12:43:38 Heid, good to have you here adding some class...
7626 2018-11-14 12:43:37 There's roughly a six week lag between wholesale price of oil and the price we pay at the pump.
7627 2018-11-14 12:43:34 Snake Oil 

Their words were slick and black

Were you mesmerised by the iridescence

All you see is rainbows

Not the black

Not the facts

How was is to swallow?

Did it slide down smooth?

Was it thick in your gullet?

Some will keep it down

But more will come around

7631 2018-11-14 12:42:58 Because his policy is to 100% phase out oil.  He won't announce that however.
7632 2018-11-14 12:42:39 Oh dear. Coconut oil is good for burns. @HelenatOakmead
7633 2018-11-14 12:42:37 We are experiencing the longest daily decrease in #oil prices ever. Whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about it, something about that strikes me as cool.  Oh, oh, here comes the snow!
7634 2018-11-14 12:42:33 Clearly he's still very new at this.  He's got to do a better job of lying and diverting our attention.  We don't support Saudi because they are our only friend.  We support them because we want their oil. Say it, please.

7639 2018-11-14 12:41:59 Tell me what has England got to trade??? Nae oil. Nae gas. Nae fish. GM crops. Plants like Dyson, Toyota, and other car manufacturers HAVE LEFT ALREADY. Banks are setting up shop in EU. So tell me - how will you cope with bugger all to trade with??

7641 2018-11-14 12:41:37 Hi Stephanie, I'm happy to confirm that we only use RSPO certified sustainable oil in our treats. I'll definitely pass your comments on to the team in the graze kitchen though 
7642 2018-11-14 12:41:33 Since 1999 Nigerian Government has depended on oil & gas not to even refine fuel here but to sell crude and import pms we are going no where with this
7643 2018-11-14 12:41:32 He could sell oil to the Arabs. One tap of his moustache and the world is smitten. The boy LyeNaykerr (copyright Mick Channon) does boil liberal piss on the reggers though. Good point.

7660 2018-11-14 12:39:34 @p_hannam Have read your article on SA oil spill, but it reads as if it has happened already, not that it is a potential scenario. It wasn’t until para 6 that I realised it was not real. A bit misleading. Needs clarification?

7663 2018-11-14 12:39:13 @VOCMOpenline when discovered, oil companies told Gov secretly....we will not be responsible for loss of your  resources WHEN we spill oil. 

You kill the fishery first then we take the oil.  That's what I believe.  They would have to compensate all fisherman. So gov killed it

7668 2018-11-14 12:38:43 It would appear that everyone sold $Oil and bought #NatGas. Both moves are extreme and somewhat irrational.
7669 2018-11-14 12:38:41 I'm trying to make better choices to be eco and ethically friendly but as you say it's a minefield. I don't think that there should be a universal law to make companies be transparent about their ingredients and say 'palm oil' rather than hiding it under a fancy name
7670 2018-11-14 12:38:26 Saw the same thing happen to a friends truck when he accidentally ignited some oily rags with a cigarette butt. Gas and oil sent it out of control quickly and melted all the aluminum parts.

7708 2018-11-14 12:33:40 Pretty doubtful some of these 'superstars' are in any way not harming the environment. Coca Cola in particular. There are more facets to the debate than simply do they use palm oil.
7709 2018-11-14 12:33:21 By it's made many of oil. Do you want to be made mainly from oil? I have no real issue with veganism each to their own but this isn't even food...
7710 2018-11-14 12:33:21 I have followed the oil&gas and mining industry for +15 years. Looked at similare project to #KP2, they will always need to do additional work.
7711 2018-11-14 12:33:20 Absolutely. And that the things we don’t make directly out of oil are usually dependent on infrastructure that was built on the assumption that we could burn this stuff forever.
7712 2018-11-14 12:33:19 I still don’t understand how we don’t have a different way by now. Guess it’s kill the world then they may stop being greedy humans and just worried about how much money they make for a world about to die. 
All the smart in the world and greedy oil/money hungry people control us.

More sugar and junk like palm oil added
7714 2018-11-14 12:32:05 The interesting question for me w/r/t oil is after the 14/15 collapse, did enough time lapse & price rise to the point where oil cos & industry put their defensive postures aside?

7717 2018-11-14 12:31:45 this palm oil, sunflower oil are all overrated. Were they even traditionally used as a cooking oil in India?

7731 2018-11-14 12:30:40 Yes. It would be funny but for the 30% loss of revenue I have had in the past 35 days and how much harder it is to feed my family and the families of my employees. America is gullable & dumb about shale oil; enjoy it now because its a pay now, or pay OPEC a LOT more later thing.

7737 2018-11-14 12:30:23 1 tweet from @realDonaldTrump is enough to set oil prices tumbling down !! It's like a lion's roar when hyenas create noise !! In Marathi there is a saying "एक फाईट,वातावरण टाइट"!!
7738 2018-11-14 12:29:45 Because before 1998 you couldnt smuggle 200 Bensons through Dover and the last 20 years UK been flooded with oil war victims? Let rich suffer consequences of their agenda! But its been poor thats felt it in housing,welfare etc etc etc. Cause they fought my Grandfather  I despise.

7749 2018-11-14 12:28:13 When our Government & Corporations use HFT to manipulate prices it is a stealth form of Price Controls. History shows us Price Controls lead to chaotic price increases in the future. The future is now for #NaturalGas +15% today, the future moonshots for oil & Au Ag are coming.
7750 2018-11-14 12:28:07 That Iceland commercial is touching. India is world’s biggest consumer of palm oil, 60% of it is imported. Modi govt has made efforts to produce it locally.
7751 2018-11-14 12:28:04 同じ意見。

7752 2018-11-14 12:27:53 Hi there, palm oil is a very big focus for us right now, and I'm pleased to confirm that we only use RSPO certified sustainable oil in our snacks. I'll be sure to pass your feedback over to the team in the graze kitchen though

7759 2018-11-14 12:27:08 Oil prices reduced by 20%. Petrol price reduced by 10%. Fake news.
7760 2018-11-14 12:27:01 @PMOIndia @RahulGandhi Modi lucky guy. Oil prices collapsing @Swamy39 The USA confounded everyone by giving waiver to buy Iranian oil.China  demand also falling.Indian ecnomy gains #Oilpricefall
7761 2018-11-14 12:26:57 2013, Paul McCartney posted a letter on his website calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to release 30 Greenpeace activists whom Russian authorities arrested during a protest over Arctic oil drilling in September. All the activists involved had their charges dropped
7762 2018-11-14 12:26:55 When Trudeau and the Libs mismanage the energy portfolio and severely damage Alberta's economy, it really is no surprise that they voted no.  When oil is sold at such a huge discount, the money well runs out as do investments.

I make papaya oil
It shouldn't be used in the day cos it can cause photosensitivity or sun damage to the skin
Wanted to see if the warning is true, used it for 2 weeks in the day. Had a rash as a result. Stopped and rash went away

7777 2018-11-14 12:24:39 Ok so what should our government do? Allow electric cars? Self sustaining houses? Bc I bet our boy @MarkRuffalo real estate that he keeps thermostats comfortable all year round using oil or gas. Should we outlaw plastic? And the climate is not changing so fast that we can’t adapt

7783 2018-11-14 12:23:41 The parallel market has already done that math for us.. I think the question should be is we stop subsidising goods such as cooking oil and fuel etc.. what will the rate be

7786 2018-11-14 12:23:36 don't even get me started on this palm oil tripe. it's not even right. Have to ban livestock and soya beans before them. Won't mention that though as that writes off their shit ready meals.

7788 2018-11-14 12:23:27 Let's just stop buying their oil.
7789 2018-11-14 12:23:27 The article I posted above supports this, as fuel efficiency drops the rate that an engine block heats up naturally lowers as well, the oil in the vehicle needs to be a certain temperature to work as intended, therefore the oil takes longer to heat up or doesn't even manage to...
7790 2018-11-14 12:22:56 It's dangerous to assume everyone can just use medical marijuana. That's a fallacy. It doesn't work for everything nor everyone; some are allergic; it's inaccessible for most. 

I've been using the oil but it upsets my stomach and coincides with hives and other reactions.
7791 2018-11-14 12:22:49 Aku ga gitu tau sih, tp harusnya sih gpp. Dulu aku pernah pake rosehip oil setelah phytoniacin dan ga kenapa2 sih

7793 2018-11-14 12:22:39 No not really. Just a wee bit of it really beefs up the flavour. Oh and truffle oil!
7794 2018-11-14 12:22:38 I think a crucial mistake was environmentalists screaming about peak oil just a few years back.  Now it's coming out of our ears.  That doesn't do much good for one's credibility.
7795 2018-11-14 12:22:27 if i were to choose a tgt in oil for today, that wud be 57.50
7796 2018-11-14 12:22:21 Well, to be fair, beer and oil do need the same kind of storage conditions!
7797 2018-11-14 12:21:58 I just feel sorry for shrek being groomed by fool and now suffering from Stockholm syndrome. Still on the bright side lots of hugging in bushes full of divs.
7798 2018-11-14 12:21:53 never understood how people feel they have some edge with oil stocks. Good Luck with that
7799 2018-11-14 12:21:38 They just add palm oil while mixing the puff puff. Unfortunately those that sell it have ditched it to hawk for pure water, pure bliss and soft drinks in traffic

7809 2018-11-14 12:20:40 Just another fact how the British public are being screwed over.... My gripe.... Oil prices

7815 2018-11-14 12:19:33 Oil is oversold and may bounce.   Even so, rates are rising and the trade wars continue. Economy is late cycle. Can’t change that.

7836 2018-11-14 12:17:32 I’m conflicted about it because, well done Iceland for taking an ethical stance on palm oil (they were one of the worst rated for their use of it), and I’m all for promoting the plight of orang-utans, but at the same time it’s dishonest to keep saying it was banned.
7837 2018-11-14 12:17:31 Is there any logical reason?

7839 2018-11-14 12:17:27 And it is bloody depressing place too. What attractions do they have to lure the tourists in? Some ugly buildings built with oil money that have no relevance to its people and no beauty in them either. They are desperate to be presented as "European", but it will never work!
7840 2018-11-14 12:17:09 The neatsfoot oil arrived from Amazon, so just oiled this a recent #Oxfam find, a small brown Osprey satchel-style handbag. Looks great. Stinks a bit, but smell will wear off. Some of my most unusual bags were looking sad and dry when I got them.
7841 2018-11-14 12:16:54 Forget oil, look at natura gas lol. Big day for swn ugaz chk rrc
7842 2018-11-14 12:16:50 You could argue, however, that Iceland's message is that they're removing palm oil from their products due to the destruction caused by palm oil plantations.

Granted, they're not asking for donations. But there is still a message there.
7843 2018-11-14 12:16:48 I think they were to an extent. There's a lot of land used for sunflower and rapeseed oil. But you have to bear in mind there are a lot more people now.

7913 2018-11-14 12:09:36 I'm not surprised that $AMRN #fabricated his research. Because fish oil doesn't work the way the company claims. Previously, studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of fish oil in reducing the risk of mortality from #CVD. And there was no result.

With projected oversupply of 1.5m barrels a day OPEC need to cut this amount just to balance it

7926 2018-11-14 12:08:04 cont... If the trees are planted on already cleared land, I think that would be a good thing..  So I'm thinking if we choose sustainable palm oil products, then it's still a good product..

Boycotting such companies holds them to account.

7952 2018-11-14 12:05:01 I've been looking into palm oil and it seems a good product. It's grown on trees and provides a greater yield per hectare compared to sunflower oil or soyabean. The problem seems to be that rainforests are being slashed and burnt to be replaced by the palm trees.
7953 2018-11-14 12:04:38 Twitter mind - Does anyone use a palm oil free moisturiser available in the UK they can recommend? #skincare #PalmOilFree

7955 2018-11-14 12:04:33 We’re also in the middle of refinery maintenance season, when refiners are adjusting their facilities to process the winter blend, so the refiners are not buying a lot of oil right now. That lower demand is also helping to push down oil prices.

7957 2018-11-14 12:04:13 Truly sustainable palm oil. Properly managed. Enforced and regulated is acceptable. But the problem comes with what counts as sustainable and how hard suppliers are willing to enforce it.
7958 2018-11-14 12:04:11 The #orangutans could be extinct within a generation >> destructive #palmoil companies like @Indofood are to blame. RT to tell members of palm oil certification org @RSPOtweets to commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO

7973 2018-11-14 12:02:24 oh yeah, I'm v glad they dropped palm oil. Just tired of explaining to armchair eco-warriors on Arsebook that there never was  a ban. And chemtrails don't exist. And 9/11 was not a false-flag operation. And vaccination works..... etc etc
7974 2018-11-14 12:02:23 It generally takes a while for the lower oil price to translate into lower gas prices, and this has been a very swift drop for oil, so it can definitely feel like gas prices should be dropping faster than they are.
7975 2018-11-14 12:02:14 Lol idk why Trinis and Grenadians get into it over oil down on here
7976 2018-11-14 12:02:09 It's no big secret kid, look it up on historically credible sources, i.e. not Mercola or Natural News which are pseudoscience tin hats peddling their own snake oil vitamins.
7977 2018-11-14 12:02:07 NO PALM OIL!!!!
7978 2018-11-14 12:02:01 I'm glad you're not in pain anymore. You know olive oil heated a little and rubbed into the joints is good for it too?
7979 2018-11-14 12:01:55 You & your party of smiling centrists have no credibility. You bought an old pipeline to pump tar sands in to the Pacific. You gave over $3B in subsidies to your corporate oil masters. You could have made us leaders in green energy, but you chose corporate oil instead.
7980 2018-11-14 12:01:52 Maybe it's wrong of me to have this thought, but I'd love to see one of tRump and his family being lowered into a boiling vat of oil on the scales of justice.

7992 2018-11-14 12:00:03 Today I dropped badly. #Oil #Brent 65.91$ (-2.85)
7993 2018-11-14 12:00:01 This is what i'm thinking, although it's not tested on animals it still has an impact if non sustainable palm oil is used. I'm actually writing a post at the moment about it - cue worm can being opened!
7994 2018-11-14 11:59:49 I just poured antifreeze in my oil, if this is any indication of how my past two weeks have been

7999 2018-11-14 11:58:54 It helps to raise awareness, but boycotting palm oil is not the answer. What we really need is tough global regulations against illegal deforestation. We need global governance of sustainable palm oil.

8057 2018-11-14 11:52:41 Also in foodstuffs, AIUI, palm oil is often replacing animal fat because of its texture & properties. We lose palm oil, and we’ll see animal, or other (less productive) hydrogenated/saturated fat back in food, which is far more likely to facilitate more deforestation, not less

I don't want to break the bank but also don't want to break the planet. Thanks!
8240 2018-11-14 11:33:01 Sanctions and blockades are often crimes against humanity. The UK killed 300.000+ Germans in WW1 with an illegal blockade of the North Sea. Bush killed 500.000 Iraqi children with his oil for food program. 

Now Trump is starving the Irani people to accomplish a political goal.
8241 2018-11-14 11:32:50 15% ethanol hikes gas/food/car repair cost.
Making Saudis pump more & exempting ChiComs from Iran sanctions cuts oil prices, hurtsoil production/jobs.
So,
High ethanol cost: Good for the economy?
oil: Good for the economy?
oil/jobs/independence: Bad for the economy?

8328 2018-11-14 11:25:20 This isn't reflected on packaging, nor is it something the brand is actively championing in the online sphere. It might be a good idea to relook your strategy surrounding palm oil, all things considered.

8341 2018-11-14 11:23:22 I give up. I find organic peanut butter claggy and dry so I'm simply not going to use it anymore. I'd rather just avoid ALL products that contain palm oil; it seems the best way in the long run.

8363 2018-11-14 11:21:56 Agreed. I always avoid companies i know to be bad (cough nestle cough) but if I can see a company is making an effort to drive sustainability I will eat palm oil. Or vegetable oil.

8402 2018-11-14 11:17:57 Hello! Where else does baby oil come from?! Common guys, Barry is a smart woman, she knows stuff.
8403 2018-11-14 11:17:55 To a point, on a wider scale. But it remains that what most people got upset about are the specific impacts of palm oil. These are not addressed by reducing beef consumption. More informed analyses of industry production methods and trade offs in land use for oil are needed.
8404 2018-11-14 11:17:41 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
8405 2018-11-14 11:17:40 what i mean prices may go a lot further till oil reverses completely, and that's a whole lot doubt, in the contrary just a short relieve and down to the south
8406 2018-11-14 11:17:39 Yes they do contain Palm oil. Sorry you're disappointed Leigh, we'll pass your comments on this over to our Food Team. Thanks for getting in touch. - Jake
8407 2018-11-14 11:17:37 Oh I wouldn't want it for revenge in the least. No retribution. Nothing like that. But much more to have better priorities. Instead of putting oil execs in charge or regulating the oil industry and making things more dangerous, or putting someone who hates poor people...
8408 2018-11-14 11:17:31 Flowtest completed at bellow the future production flowrates

Tell him that prod flowrates are around 4-5times less than initial flowrates

So if they tested Portland at 350bopd, flowrates will be 70-80bopd
8409 2018-11-14 11:17:28 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
8410 2018-11-14 11:17:20 It's not perfect, but there are 4 million people just in Sumatra who are dependent on the #palm oil inductry. #sustainable #palmoil when it's done properly means #nodeforestation

8421 2018-11-14 11:15:49 Good morning- pretty cold in New York today-  everyone is talking about oil's plummet, but what about nat gas- uo 40% in the last month and a half.  I guess the market is expecting a very cold winter for the country- hopefully not for the market.

8426 2018-11-14 11:15:30 Would you recommend CBD oil? tried 5-HTPs and melatonin supplements with no luck :/
8427 2018-11-14 11:15:28 The idea was also to make Europeans economies much less sensitive to sudden oil embargoes; price increases would be much less steep and they could reduce taxes and consumers wouldn’t feel anything.
8428 2018-11-14 11:15:25 Barrels of oil as an investment?
8429 2018-11-14 11:15:18 Too much sesame oil?

8431 2018-11-14 11:15:16 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
8432 2018-11-14 11:15:05 Absolutely agree. It really annoys me when manufacturers just say 'vegetable' oil. I try to pick the products that actually say what they are but there's often not an option
8433 2018-11-14 11:14:56 The outlook for energy prices including electricity seems more promising as the cost of oil tumbles and as Europe absorbs bigger imports of LNG  from the US and record pipeline gas purchases from Russia
8434 2018-11-14 11:14:52 No, you're thinking of those things in old cars that you use to tell how much oil is in the engine.

Venezuela was doing great, until the oil price fell.
Low oil prices is also sign of world slowing economies.
8444 2018-11-14 11:13:18 @BeckyQuick any chance the US opened the Iranian oil up enough to cripple the Saudi’s through low prices? Sanctions w/out sanctions as it were?

8451 2018-11-14 11:12:47 No but there's currently an uproar about deforestation due to palm oil from people are chowing down on a burger the next minute (as is their prerogative!). My first post was just saying ditching the burger is probably more effective at reducing habitat loss
8452 2018-11-14 11:12:46 I keep trying new treatments. Each one fails to work for me. Recently tried CBD oil & edibles. I’m having partial success. Much better than no success! 
8453 2018-11-14 11:12:44 Hard working Canadians who actually grow the economy and work can see right through your environmental gospel. We're buying oil from the Saudi's at world prices, and selling our oil for next to nothing. This is Liberal economics at its finest, and does nothing to save the planet!
8454 2018-11-14 11:12:38 All I hear is someone talking about how oil is going all over the market, then it went into another maeket, Worked great because it kept going in circles.  Funn aaas shiznit
8455 2018-11-14 11:12:33 L’Occitane use palm oil? Their fifty quid for a fucking shower gel products use fucking palm oil!?
Oooo.... middle class rage! Wait til I tell the missus!
8456 2018-11-14 11:12:12 Can you pls tell me how many countries you've traveled to and their customer refuse you carrying 2 litrs of palm oil?

8459 2018-11-14 11:11:49 The blame is not on the one who does not accept advice. Rather, it is on the one who present it inappropriately
8460 2018-11-14 11:11:47 He always wanted his chicken fingers pulled from the oil early. It wasn’t completely raw but if a little pink was still in there we still sent them out. Thus “raw chicken” became his nickname.
8461 2018-11-14 11:11:44 At least they did something. I’ve seen cases where companies just leave their artists to burn till there’s nothing left, whether it be addressing the issue wrongly and adding oil to fire, or even not addressing it at all
8462 2018-11-14 11:11:31 Yes exactly. The present govt started overzealously on diversification. The goose chase of oil in Kaduna is where everything ended.
8463 2018-11-14 11:11:25 Market seems to be recovering from lows this morning. Oil based still downwards making BP and Shell start to look attractive. Just bought some XPpower which hopefully will do well in the near future.

8468 2018-11-14 11:10:31 Canada and EU have a symbiotic marketbrekationship.
Canada mostly exports minerals and timber. 
We can't create giant UK forests by 2020 and would have to wait even longer for them to turn into crude oil or coal.

8477 2018-11-14 11:09:28 They should because they are public companies and not private...and every citizen pay direct or indirect tax ...to government...which govt pay to oil companies  ...by the way if these oil companies make profit whom they will give the profit govt or people...
8478 2018-11-14 11:09:25 Which brand oil, and how are you liking it?
8479 2018-11-14 11:09:24 Vegetable oils are often listed as just that - vegetable oil. Otherwise it might be possible to target oils more commonly grown in the UK and US. Without that you run the risk of driving deforestation somewhere like South America
8480 2018-11-14 11:09:23 Raflesia arnoldi is evident that palm oil plantations is not a monoculture plant like soybean farm, it’s fiercest competitor.
8481 2018-11-14 11:09:18 หนักก็เอาเบาก็สู้ 
8482 2018-11-14 11:09:17 Yes, but if they sold branded stuff that wasn't and you knew you could pick anything up in their store that didn't contain palm oil how much better would that be. I couldn't manage on just Iceland food
8483 2018-11-14 11:09:17 Because Germany was so short on oil, steel and (most critically) food,  the Nazis would have had to crush their enemies completely in the first phase of the war in order to have any chance of winning. Unable to defeat Britain in the West,

8487 2018-11-14 11:08:27 Im trying, Have you tried a bowl with warm water and albas oil?
8488 2018-11-14 11:08:19 Hopefully the fall in oil prices will feed its way through into cheaper energy prices, also reducing inflationary pressures.
8489 2018-11-14 11:08:18 Environmentalists would say decrease in global demand for crude oil is a good thing ....

8504 2018-11-14 11:07:15 Mesmerising... It's tough to get it through to the oil lobby. That we only have 1 planet, and if we pollute and destroy it, it's game over.
8505 2018-11-14 11:07:09 I have a cousin who has just started his career in an oil rig. He acknowledges the fact that oil industry is dying and wants to get into a project where his skills could be used in renewables. Something like onshore or offshore wind farms.
8506 2018-11-14 11:07:06 yes! honest and down to earth, but so beautiful! 
I'm also very seriously thinking about the type of olive oil I've been using now.
8507 2018-11-14 11:06:58 Damn, hearing that it's at least 5 times more efficient for land usage than other types of oil makes boycotting redundant at best.
8508 2018-11-14 11:06:56 You might want to look into Kratom and CBD oil.  Go with natural whenever possible
8509 2018-11-14 11:06:41 @vicenews You produced this documentary but I can't find it using the search engine on your website. You have some interesting information but hard to search for information when I need to do research. "The Battle Raging In Nigeria Over Control Of Oil"
8510 2018-11-14 11:06:40 No. Don’t phase out coal or oil or natural gas and don’t attempt to add a carbon tax and tell me I’ll be getting back direct cost of it while not telling me I won’t get covered for all the indirect costs.
8511 2018-11-14 11:06:31 The thing is because palm oil is more productive than other crops by using say, coconut oil, instead, you're going to require more land to produce the same amount of other oil. This is why most conservation charities dont have a boycott stance

8521 2018-11-14 11:05:38 It's only until those countries can make different arrangements. The US doesn't want to harm those countries that rely on oil without giving them the chance to find an alternative source.

8526 2018-11-14 11:05:22 My mum called just to tell me not to use the orange oil she made for me, and go under the sun with it, so it doesn't burn my skin. Then called 2 hours later just to tell me to stay hydrated always because the sun is too hot. How can I ever show this woman how much I love her 
8527 2018-11-14 11:05:21 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
8528 2018-11-14 11:05:19 Our Canadian government, meanwhile, just bought a 60 year old pipeline and plans to expand oil production.
8529 2018-11-14 11:05:14 That's not the key comparison that is at issue, though. Not eating beef does not solve the issue if palm oil or other oil sources, and improved methods in using different oils, are better or worse, locally and globally, in reducing biodiversity impacts.
8530 2018-11-14 11:04:52 Has anyone come across any studies/commentary on the discourse around palm oil? 

Especially anything re how almost all of it ignores Malaysia/Malaysians
8531 2018-11-14 11:04:51 @Greenpeace have shared that @CadburyUK and @Oreo are two of the biggest users of palm oil. If you want sweet treats free of palm oil check out @marksandspencer 'All Butter Cookies' or @BionaOrganic nut butters!
8532 2018-11-14 11:04:48 All of their own brands are palm oil free aren't they?
8533 2018-11-14 11:04:40 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]

8536 2018-11-14 11:03:58 I do a lot there too, they are missing a trick not going totally palm oil free with their brands as it would save me a lot of time in all the other shops I go to checking products and giving up

8541 2018-11-14 11:03:12 OPEC and its partners are discussing a proposal to cut oil output by up  to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) for 2019, three sources familiar  with the issue said, to avert an oversupply that would weaken prices.

8543 2018-11-14 11:02:46 Good point about Provenge both about sponsors getting lucky and since there was a similar controversy there (remember the Frovenge thing)?  Anyway the magnitude of benefit is so large I have a hard time believing it’s all or mostly due to mineral oil.
8544 2018-11-14 11:02:44 Does it need to be an either/or? Giving up or at least greatly reducing eating beef/lamb AND avoiding palm oil rather than focus on just one element

8558 2018-11-14 11:00:37 I recently read an article saying worst year since 1901 for USD denominated assets as 89% of them were in the red YTD, the exception included oil, so now we are at 90% with oil down as well. When do we reach 100%? S&P still up for the year.

8565 2018-11-14 11:00:09 Well done in highlighting this Iceland, how about not selling any branded products that contain palm oil in you stores. That would make me do all my weekly shopping at Iceland
8566 2018-11-14 11:00:00 #Oil plummets. Yesterday it fell 7% due to fears of a drop in demand.
8567 2018-11-14 10:59:54 I don't believe most governments are going to follow through with their pledges to phase out oil and other carbon-based energy. China, India, Russia and the Far East won't do it because it's not within their economic interests. #Energy101 #Climatism #Oil

8583 2018-11-14 10:58:02 Hi Mark, we share your concerns about the environmental impacts of palm oil and agree more people need to hear Rang-tan’s message. Instead of simply boycotting palm oil, which could lead to less efficient oil crops being used in its place, we’d encourage consumers to support 1/2

8585 2018-11-14 10:58:00 I used to buy palm oil for a global food comp. They use it bc it is cheap, easy to use, & hasn’t trans fat problems. They used veg oil b4 bc it was cheaper & easy to use. Then people got concerned about trans fat so they switched. There are always other options, if ppl push them.
8586 2018-11-14 10:57:35 You are all infected by nationalism. You Brits remind me of Serbs under Slobodan Milośević, when under oil embargo: "We don't care, we are Serbs. We can ride horses. We have longer culture than you. We ate with forks when you still ate with hands."

8637 2018-11-14 10:49:26 Dani - this is the crucial point. There exist NO proper solid analysis of the full trade offs between choosing palm oil or other oil sources produced elsewhere. None of the sources you cite, nor the IUCN report of some time ago do so. Not acknowledging this is misleading.

8650 2018-11-14 10:46:46 suggest you do some research on 911.

8765 2018-11-14 10:31:43 I work in lubrication, for perspective 1 gallon of oil spilled 'will' contaminate 1 million gallons of water.
That is just a single gallon. Multiply that out to an industry size scale from a rig and the potential is horrendous.
8766 2018-11-14 10:31:43 They haven’t got rid of palm oil either, they still stock products with it in.
8767 2018-11-14 10:31:34 @NutellaGlobal what are your plans to either eradicate the palm oil in your product or ensure sustainability of the forest?
8768 2018-11-14 10:31:03 I think I may have overdone it with the coconut oil this morning

8771 2018-11-14 10:30:47 You are still ignoring the question on your plastic bag policy. The palm oil campaign and this add is a stunt to drive up more sales. You care no more for the organutan or the environment than you do about telling the truth. I’ll back a truthful company not a lying one 
8772 2018-11-14 10:30:43 I read you are replacing the palm oil in your own-brand products with other oils and butter. These oils need up to x10 more land to produce the same yield as palm, causing an even more devasting impact on the environment.  1/2
8773 2018-11-14 10:30:33 But surely all land that is used for agriculture has been cultivated from the destruction of forest. The solution isn't about whether we use Palm oil or not because the alternatives to Palm oil require more land... the solution is global population control to lessen human impact.

8786 2018-11-14 10:29:02 hey! v pleased to see more awareness of unsustainable palm oil but palm oil is the most efficient of it’s equivalents by a long shot so switching from palm oil would kill more rainforest - it’s about making companies produce sustainable palm oil that doesn’t destroy forests!!

8789 2018-11-14 10:28:57 Thank you for that explanation. I’m so much the wiser now about where my taxes and half a century of oil revenues have gone. To offset Britannia’s deficit.
8790 2018-11-14 10:28:55 It depends. Is it sustainable palm oil? If yes, they are leading the herd. If not, they should be dropped immediately and an apology issued.

8793 2018-11-14 10:28:14 Aiden Kerr claims that there will be 0 trade between Scotland and England. My question is where will England get its Water, Oil,  Electricity and Gas from in that case
8794 2018-11-14 10:27:48 Thank you for responding - why don’t you put sustainable palm oil on your packaging? By putting just palm oil you will lose sales & it is confusing for purchaser

8800 2018-11-14 10:27:10 Strategy? Governor of Bank of England needs persuading not to invest in oil as a hedge for future turbulence.  What will crash if climate fears turn to panic. You decide.

8802 2018-11-14 10:26:39 Sounds like you’re cooking past its smoke point, not waiting until the Pan is hot, or maybe have thin pans with poor heat distribution/hot spots.

8817 2018-11-14 10:24:56 Khashoggi's murder doesn't have that much power.

8824 2018-11-14 10:24:04 Sorry, I misread Amanda's question as current tense, not future tense. No, I have no idea where it'll go next year, and nobody does either. There was a large expectation that oil would go to China this year, but that stopped being the case a good long while ago.

Give it your wife. She'll know what to do with it and she'll love you for it.

8936 2018-11-14 10:10:23 This is a good analysis with one exception.
Canada is world's 2nd biggest exporter because its main exports come from huge natural resources: minerals, oils ( inc. veg. Oil), and timber. 
The UK can't do that!
8937 2018-11-14 10:10:22 I’ve also had some email spam this morning inviting me to get involved in a multi-million dollar project involving crude oil … which is nice.

8942 2018-11-14 10:09:38 There are no natural characteristics of the supernatural, you are mixing the oil and water. Just because we may not not know how to detect/test it yet, doesn't default to it being supernatural. It defaults to we don't know yet.
8943 2018-11-14 10:09:27 that's why I just tell people my vape has no thc cbd oil. No one says a thing lol people can be more okay with that other than no nic. vapes

8945 2018-11-14 10:09:24 Good news for motorists. Oil prices at 3 yr low. Strong supplies & weak demand. So rise unlikely.
8946 2018-11-14 10:08:49 The worst thing Obama did was spread Bush's Illegal War. Somehow we're dropping even more bombs on more countries, & we're still in Syria- guarding Israel's oil extraction, exactly what you'd expect since Dick Cheney's a board member of Genie Oil / Energy. Trump ran anti-war.

8954 2018-11-14 10:07:30 A surge in #oil production (notably from the US which is now the world's largest producer) is pushing prices lower, with stockpiles rising at a time when demand expectations have been weakened by slowing economic growth in Japan, Germany and China.

8974 2018-11-14 10:05:29 Oil crash was too much for equities to stay up. Oil is now straight down and is waiting on inventory. Another big oil down will end it ST and we bounce, helping equities Cramer, right?
8975 2018-11-14 10:05:05 Ironis melihat hasil sawit kita diekspor sebagai Crude Palm Oil, lalu diimpor lagi sebagai bahan jadi ke kita.

9044 2018-11-14 09:56:45 Those that argue oil companies are the ones that came up with the global warming denial campaign, when confronted with evidence against heating of the planet, are perhaps the most closed minded. The sun itself is evidence Earth is not going thru a heating cycle but a cooling one.
9045 2018-11-14 09:56:30 Yes not knocking #Angus as such. It's just that they have RNSd that they will vote to do a placing at 9p on the 22/11/2018. So I thought I'd wait for the SP to drop around there as that is what almost always happens. It's Vonk that arranged the placing not me.
9046 2018-11-14 09:55:55 That's how smoke and mirrors marketing works in pseudoscience. An incredibly efective one should I say. You don't believe me? Take a look at the amount of people defending coconut oil and its suposed benefits despite the actual science debunking them.

9053 2018-11-14 09:54:33 While it is indeed ridiculous that the Iceland Christmas advert was banned… in a way it was a blessing. Consumers, who before had no idea what palm oil was, are suddenly enlightened. And companies are realising they should act before those consumers force their hand.

9058 2018-11-14 09:53:43 Ironis melihat hasil sawit kita diekspor sebagai CPO( Crude Palm Oil) lalu diimpor lagi sebagai bahan jadi. Sumber daya alam yang kita miliki tidak diolah dan tidak memiliki nilai tambah yang tinggi. Ini yang harus diubah, kita harus mampu membangun industri pengolahannya.

9061 2018-11-14 09:53:26 The danger is, for Cdn. oil, that the World will find other sources. And there is not just 1 type of oil and 1 type of refinery. So we are talking a variety of oil types/refineries here and the like buyers. Thus, Canada loses on many market fronts.

9067 2018-11-14 09:52:05 There is a natural carbon cycle of exhalation of CO2 from animals and absorption of CO2 by growing plants which those animals eat. The exhaled/absorbed 'contemporary' CO2 results in a steady CO2 level- until fossil CO2 from burning coal & oil are released into the atmosphere.
9068 2018-11-14 09:52:05 Ginsters is a highly committed member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and has been for many years.  We were the first brand in the Savoury Pastry market to use sustainable palm oil and continue to be committed to using it in our savoury products.
9069 2018-11-14 09:52:00 the market didn't rally and oil prices also never came back in petrol bunk. I think oil companies need to recover their bags which they sponsored for the statue.

9077 2018-11-14 09:50:59 Oil prices cratering, bank shares depressed, German GDP negative. Sounds to me like major downshift in global growth.

9114 2018-11-14 09:46:07 By the end of 2016/17 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own brand products was certified sustainable, and we are currently working on updating this figure for 2017/18... 2/2Mariya

9131 2018-11-14 09:42:52 The economic irony of a better #SouthAfrica #economy may rest - amongst domestic factors - on slower #US growth, falling #oil prices and more attractive valuations for investment coming from Emerging Markets. But domestic policy needs to also be competitive to take advantage.

9186 2018-11-14 09:36:07 Hey tea tree oil nya aku mau dong.. aku pake itu jg sekarang udah mau abis..
9187 2018-11-14 09:36:01 Face oil dulu kyknya 
9188 2018-11-14 09:36:01 Don't say it out loud but this falling oil price is the best thing for central banks worldwide ..
9189 2018-11-14 09:35:59 Spoken like a red Tory. Taxing wages is not progressive.  It's taking money out of pockets, and the local economy.  We need to actually tax oil and large estates, that's progressive.
9190 2018-11-14 09:35:44 Scents are great mood enhancers too, especially essential oils. Try diffusing citrusy oils like orange, lemon, grapefruit. Or mix a few drops of lavender with a carrier oil, apply to base of neck (back) and soles of feet
9191 2018-11-14 09:35:31 in the stupid world that we are in a rally in oil rallies equities.. I like that the pajama traders are just banging us down off of Europe which was banged down off of worries about their economy,,
9192 2018-11-14 09:35:09 Global oil supply will outpace demand throughout 2019, as a relentless rise in output swamps growth in consumption that is at risk from a slowing economy, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.
9193 2018-11-14 09:35:07 Yeah. Remember when Scotland had its own Stock Exchange in Glasgow and as soon as oil was discovered Westminster shut it down. They didn't want the Scottish people to see the billions of dollars going through it every week.

9208 2018-11-14 09:33:07 What a disappointing page on ‘innovation’ from the Oil & Gas industry! This is only about (finally) getting serious about their own footprint.

9320 2018-11-14 09:18:08 European shares sank to their lowest in two weeks on Wednesday after data that showed the German and Japanese economies contracting in the third quarter fuelled worries about global growth amid a plunge in oil prices.
9321 2018-11-14 09:18:07 Africa Oil says to date, approximately 30,000 barrels of oil has been transported to Mombasa by road from the storage in Turkana under the Early Oil Production System(EOPS). The first lifting of sweet Kenyan crude oil stored in Mombasa is expected in Q2 of 2019.

9326 2018-11-14 09:17:27 Wait that is *not* what you said. You said palm oil can never be sustainable. I asked what we should do with the already defrosted land and your answer is...grow palm oil? Apologies but I'm a little confused at your stance here.

9340 2018-11-14 09:15:18 The DNC reversed its short lived policy and voted to embrace $ from oil and gas . Change is not coming from the top. If we want to really address climate change we don’t need more studies, it’s time for action.
9341 2018-11-14 09:15:18 If you can flex (a lot) on the oil side of things, I reckon you could eat a Bunnings sausage, no way there is anything but artificial stuff and fillers in thise things.
9342 2018-11-14 09:15:13 i hear you, but I am really not here for this discussion, right now. i'm also really not letting the palm oil issue get mired in every other problematic issue about commercial food production and capitalism. you should be protesting Nestle, not lecturing me about it. please.

9345 2018-11-14 09:15:03 Healthier fats are in foods like unsalted nuts, seeds, avocados, oily fish, olive oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. Some saturated fats can increase the amount of cholesterol in your blood, increasing your risk of heart problems. #worlddiabetesday #healthy
9346 2018-11-14 09:14:54 @narendramodi As the price of oil goes down. Your effort on electric car revolution should go up proportionately. Eg: When u see oil getting cheaper by every $3, $1 of that $3 should go towards setting up electric car infrastructure. do this once a quarter
9347 2018-11-14 09:14:48 Bible said that spouses should not deny each other sex only maybe during fasting and the other desires to abstain 4 a while. Not for any other reason I guess. Finally sha money is the oil of romance

9358 2018-11-14 09:13:22 Avoiding palm oil is a difficult issue for me. Allergic rapeseed vegetable, soya, others, really only able to eat Olive oil. A lot of my safe food contains palm oil or the substitute has rapeseed. I hate what is happening to deforestation as well. Actively try avoiding palm.
9359 2018-11-14 09:13:17 You're right. perhaps we shouldn't be espousing naturism as a way of life, but part of a holistic attitude to rejecting all of the ills of the modern world - plastics, oil dependency etc.
9360 2018-11-14 09:13:13 I pointed the potential of existing business in India. For new player entry quite difficult except oil marketing companies.  I guess Opportunity is huge for rain and goa bcs of entry barrier for new player.
9361 2018-11-14 09:13:04 So what's the 'carbon footprint' of this? #Labor? E.G. digging up raw materials, sending them around the world in raw oil burning ships, burning coal for energy to produce them, ship them back, trucks to transport, cranes, land clearing, concrete? How 'clean' are they? #renewable

9365 2018-11-14 09:12:39 IEA reports that Global oil production has growing rapidly to record output from Saudi Arabia, Russia & the US 'more than offsets' declines from Iran & Venezuela; OPEC oil output up 200k b/d in October to 32.99m b/d #OOTT
9366 2018-11-14 09:12:33 Consumers can help create awareness about the importance of sustainable #palmoil and drive demand by purchasing sustainable palm oil products and supporting #RSPO certified organisations
9367 2018-11-14 09:12:17 Even Britannia, Sunfeast and Parle biscuits have palm oil in some of their products. Almost every Halwai shop uses palmmoil to make samosas, kachoris and fav Indian snacks. Palm oil is cheapest, has no odour, and unhealthy of all oils. It is also referred to as Meetha tel.

9369 2018-11-14 09:12:13 Yeah, I get you. There's some good research being done in this area (as well as snake oil), but the whole field seems to be like that tbh.

9374 2018-11-14 09:11:45 i'd say that a fairly large portion of our commercial food involves unfair labour practices, or has negative environmental impacts. i'm deliberately not wading in on these areas in the palm oil discussion, otherwise the entire space gets too messy. support small producers rather
9375 2018-11-14 09:11:40 Which products from Cadbury use palm oil?

9377 2018-11-14 09:11:34 020.quantity「量」

a large/small quantity of oil「大量/少量の油」
9378 2018-11-14 09:11:20 No, as I suggested, use permaculture principles and other techniques to improve soil fertility. But the threat to virgin forests from new palm oil plantations is very very real. Saying we have to agree to this because people need oil is not looking at all the factors at play.
9379 2018-11-14 09:11:16 - wash your face regularly 
- wash away extra oil and dead skin cells that may be clogging your pores
- use only oil-free cosmetics 
- minimize contrast between your skin and workout clothing/ equipment 
9380 2018-11-14 09:11:08 Monsters make me piss like I got the oil in me 
9381 2018-11-14 09:10:41 You guys have been saying oil is 'running out' for 5 decades - in turn, making a KILLING for the producers as they set their prices higher and higher for the sake of profit. Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!!!

9422 2018-11-14 09:06:05 @LOCCITANE_UK hi, I love your products and love to give them as gifts, but recently I saw you were on a list for not using sustainable palm oil.  Can you clarify for me about the palm oil use in your products?

9424 2018-11-14 09:05:40 Agreed entirely. Just want people to know it's more complex than palm oil bad, meat bad, air miles bad because that just isn't true. There are many factors to balance.

9453 2018-11-14 09:02:31 If you look at the #oil price, it is only down 10% from August lows, one can argue the rise to $85 into October was totally out of kilter and being pushed for seasonal reasons. #oott $wti $bno

9589 2018-11-14 08:45:51 The issue right now is palm oil and killing off  Orang-utans. So I have reduced / stopped buying products with this in. I won’t be a part of it, to me palm oil isn’t vegAn being linked to killing of a species.
9590 2018-11-14 08:45:45 The bigger saves in games, for the most part, that haven't been close. Again, no question Koskinen has been better but not sold Oilers success in his starts have had as much to do with him as most think.
9591 2018-11-14 08:45:45 Wrong I’m afraid. Sunpat does use palm oil, in their E471... they just don’t put that on the label, which is even more disgraceful. And they don’t guarantee sustainable palm oil either. I challenged them on this.

Thanks man. Yesterday they pulled the price back to 61.8 fib of Monday, BUT that really didn't do much to change the bearish bias on $DAX. US closed at the lows. Oil down, Asia down... So basically what else to expect but down? To 300 easily I think.

9647 2018-11-14 08:39:38 The irrefutable fact is that, since Modi came to power, the taxes on petrol and diesel were hiked so much, that even with crude oil price at a much lower level we are paying more for petrol and diesel. The govt is robbing the common man.

9724 2018-11-14 08:28:35 I think this is a big one. I don't believe hydrogen necessarily has the best economics (neither does Li-ion) but I do believe that some fairly powerful oil and gas companies will start pushing and subsidising hydrogen quite strongly when their O&G business margins are squeezed.

9729 2018-11-14 08:27:34 @MorrisonsNews 
Why when oil reached over $85 a few weeks ago you immediately raised my local diesel pump price to 1.35 Today oil is $65.00 and you haven't dropped the pump price at all. Are you waiting for the monopoly commission to see what thieving ba****s you are?

9734 2018-11-14 08:26:45 I'm not at all. Conservation is what I study for a living. I've been to numerous meetings on palm oil. I work in a large conservation organisation at the forefront of this stuff and I have literally never heard a single person say sustainable palm oil is impossible.

9736 2018-11-14 08:26:37 Now as the oil prices are going down the Indian currency is getting appreciated. But in 2014 when oil prices came down from 110$ to 40$ per barrel Indian rupee did not appreciate, probably oil companies were paying always 110$ per barrel next three years.

9739 2018-11-14 08:25:54 Interesting how the banning of an UK supermarket Xmas TV ad (made with Greenpeace vs. Palm Oil)for being political, is highlighting how we don’t have ANY regulations on the content of political advertising (Brexit bus etc.) #broken

9988 2018-11-14 07:52:11 Interested to read that Iceland’s move to “palm free” products involves increased use of dairy & beef products - known to cause more deforestation and CO2 emissions than palm oil. They could of course just use sustainable palm - but there’s no free publicity in that 
9989 2018-11-14 07:52:06 Just coconut oil
9990 2018-11-14 07:52:03 Et qu'il n'y ait plus de kérosène pour les avions , plus de gas oil pour les camions, plus de navire diesel. Faut arrêter les mesurettes Mr Philippe.

9993 2018-11-14 07:51:42 In the meantime America still trying to move out of the last century’s coal and oil. Why are we so slow to move into the future?

9995 2018-11-14 07:51:34 Try CBD oil. I heard it’s great for inflammation and it might work for Crohn’s. If it’s one of your last alternatives, why not right?!

10002 2018-11-14 07:51:12 #Coal , like #Oil & #gas , is a finite fossil fuel - & will eventually run out. What's being implemented as a non polluting replacement for the future is what matters! #skynews

10004 2018-11-14 07:51:02 @NancyPelosi The Energy independence committee could start by renewing the oil export ban while we're still dependent on Middle Eastern oil, we should reduce need by minimizing oil exports and export pipelines from #USA #GreenNewDeal
