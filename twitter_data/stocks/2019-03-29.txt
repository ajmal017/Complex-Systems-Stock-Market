14 2019-03-29 23:50:55 yes you can sell any asset for any other asset( fiat, gold, silver, even soon stocks) right on the xrp ledger. The ledger is a dex in of itself....
15 2019-03-29 23:50:31 Awww, what a shame.  It happens.  Bump Stocks aren't exactly something that people would buy instead of food or rent; it's a luxury, not a necessity.
16 2019-03-29 23:50:30 To me vktx sgmo sybx a few more are all the same, every rally gets pounced on by shorts or algos. even with the dynamics of all these stocks very different.

22 2019-03-31 23:58:53 Kind of defeats the benefits of being an index fund investor when you selectively short stocks to remove your exposure.  The driving idea behind investing in index funds is getting the return on the market.
23 2019-03-31 23:58:13 All income should be taxed at income rates and a 1% sales tax on financial instruments (stocks, bonds, options etc.) should be implemented.
24 2019-03-31 23:57:10 This is a good answer, but could be expanded a little more if someone wanted to turn from a trader to an investor. 

Why?

Because the longer you hold these positive carry asset classes, like stocks bonds & real estate, the higher the probability of winning / profiting.
25 2019-03-31 23:56:34 I need a mentor in Trading stocks :(

32 2019-03-31 23:51:02 Just lose on timeout assuming equal stocks should be sufficient.
33 2019-03-31 23:50:13 It's because they are invested in similar companies in similar categories. By bashing mxr, they're trying to get others to buy into their stocks. It's the same old s***. I've seen it countless times in trading. Bash one, to pump another. I am sitting happy with $mxr! Long and 
34 2019-03-31 23:49:54 US stocks ended the final trading day of the first quarter on a strong note on Friday and the S&P 500 posted its best quarterly gain since 2009, boosted by optimism over the latest round of trade talks between the US and China.
35 2019-03-31 23:49:23 Worst mass shooting in the world was in Las Vegas last year.  It would have been a minute fraction of the number of fatalities without ARs and bump stocks.
36 2019-03-31 23:48:42 all that stock count / timer does is punish real matchups 90% of the time while making boring matches just as boring but last 3 minutes shorter. just make puff lose timeouts if she's not up in stocks. it's shitty that it's character specific but w/e
37 2019-03-31 23:48:37 $SPY The higher the market, the prettier the charts will get. Aren't you tired yet though of buying when everyone's posting about these stocks after they're already (higher)? What's needed is a better plan.
38 2019-03-31 23:48:28 I can see auto-lose on timeout being optimal but only if stock count is the same. If the Puff is up 4 stocks to one and the match happens to go to time, having her lose would be pretty silly imo.
39 2019-03-30 23:59:42 But mini stocks (and hornets or bees or whatever 4cy street stock car) go much much slower

44 2019-03-30 23:49:15 Since I own Apple Stock, I would not vote for you. Since Apple stock is one of the most widely held stocks, you have gjven a lot of people reasons not to vote for you.

51 2019-03-30 23:42:37 Does it look at stocks outside the us? Specifically Australia ?

53 2019-03-30 23:41:13 Well you couldnt have picked a better time to learn, we’re about to have a C wave of an ABC correction and the volatility is going to explode meaning triple point and some times 4 digit swings possible atm. Aside from Crypto bottoming, stocks correcting here is a gold mine.
54 2019-03-30 23:40:13 “In related news, Charmin stocks dip slightly lower”...is a better joke than you have ever told on this platform
55 2019-03-30 23:39:28 True we dont know the exact time but think about it...You can get a take on 100K stocks of Cameco for less than 25K...Better upside there than most Juniors. And so much simpler than following and breaking my head on wich juniors I should bet on...IMHO that is off course...
