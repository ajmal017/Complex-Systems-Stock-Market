45 2018-01-16 23:47:14 Let’s see:
•No Russia collusion
•No obstruction
•No mental or physical impairment (according to Dr. Ronny Jackson)
•No racism (black unemployment at all-time low)
•No recession or stock market collapse (economy booming, stocks at historic highs)
Looks like 7-more years
46 2018-01-16 23:47:09 Stocks do not increase wages. FYI.
47 2018-01-16 23:47:08 I pay taxes. What a stupid thing to say. I work full time and own a home. I have no money in stocks. Btw, the stock market has been going up since 2009. Trump inherited a healthy market.
48 2018-01-16 23:46:39 He means his stocks.
49 2018-01-16 23:46:34 You can get these cheaper on stocks. Paid 130 for the royal mids.
50 2018-01-16 23:44:42 During the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value.
51 2018-01-16 23:44:40 Poor people don't have stocks.
52 2018-01-16 23:44:33 They are also demanding that bump-stocks be turned in or else.

69 2018-01-16 23:30:19 #dumb.  57% of Americans don't own stocks, and 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10%, and more than half of all stocks are owned by the top 1%. 

Plus the market is completely overvalued.  You're touting a meaningless 9-year trend that had nothing to do with #BLOATUS.

71 2018-01-16 23:28:36 7).  Lower #altcoin prices doesn't mean those coins are any better than #bitcoin. Just like smaller stocks prices of co's like $NVDA vs Alphabet #GOOG.  Just allows the smaller investor to believe/feel they have more stake in a co/coins growth/advancement.  What say you?
72 2018-01-16 23:28:13 Jobs are way up. Stocks at record highs even after cnn said it would crash, Isis is depleted, illegals being deported, violent crimes down

78 2018-01-16 23:25:20 What's a business model! Its best guess hype! Its a guess as to a future.  Did Kodak have a business model before they crashed. Of course they did..they guessed wrong. If stocks are based on guesses, its artificial pricing.

82 2018-01-16 23:24:31 I would have been interested to see the performance of the ETFs including the MER's vs the 24 dividend stocks that were replaced.
83 2018-01-16 23:24:26 Do penny stocks, become a day trader, get rich, and buy the planet.  I mean, if a pug can't reach global domination through penny stocks, what hope is there for anyone?!?!

84 2018-01-16 23:23:54 We need to keep America safe from White Supremacists, bump stocks and Russian influenced politicians.
85 2018-01-16 23:23:39 Are you a fucking idiot? Obama crashed the market? We all had to sit through the rebuild while all those assholes on Wall Street inflated their stocks. We had to rebuild the housing market and save the car industry because of greed. Regulations can help keep from a mass fleecing.

106 2018-01-16 23:10:08 Lithium stocks taking a beating, not a surprise after the run they've had lately. Throw in the lithium ETF copping a fair belting last night and some sentiment cooling off.

111 2018-01-16 23:06:49 Part of the problem is EU LULUCF rules, which don't reward countries for increasing forest carbon stocks, while other EU rules do encourage wood burning, even where that is counterproductive.
112 2018-01-16 23:06:34 by the time your 401k pays out the stock market will have crashed 4 or 5 more times you want stable not boombust when it's a future investment not simply trading stocks.
113 2018-01-16 23:06:13 Then you’re a financial idiot to have your entire portfolio in stocks.

117 2018-01-16 23:04:55 My thoughts go out to everyone that bought bitcoin at 18k predicting 100k per coin. Ya’ll don’t understand how overvalued stocks crash. Trading 101
118 2018-01-16 23:03:38 How low will it go?!?! 
Reminds me so much of the dot com stocks from 1999. Even worse because there is literally no limit to the number of crypto currencies that can be created. Bitcoin just happens to be the biggest name.
119 2018-01-16 23:03:27 I’m sure you are talking about bitcoin, but applying it to stocks, which moving average do you usually use for this?
120 2018-01-16 23:03:08 Stocks are going to plummet!
121 2018-01-16 23:02:50 Le débat sur la pêche avec les chalutiers Néerlandais est électrique... Souhaitons qu'ils ferment la lumière en partant pour faire des économies, non pas d'énergie mais sur la ressource et cessent de capturer des juvéniles, ce qui menace les stocks à long terme.
122 2018-01-16 23:01:24 Stocks have eight to 10 more years to grow closely followed strategist Jeff Saut told CNBC on Tuesday. "This second leg is usually the longest and strongest. Earnings are stronger + economy improves. That's where we are now," said Saut, Raymond James' chief investment strategist.
123 2018-01-16 23:01:11 Strong stocks in a down market.
ADVM  +7.5%

124 2018-01-16 22:59:29 Oh now I don’t care I have nothing left to lose my stocks are up 25% yay me! I’ll be back
125 2018-01-16 22:58:25 Watching stocks go up and down like  
126 2018-01-16 22:58:03 I'm not rich or poor, but I have invested in stocks for the last 29 years and they have increased more this last year than any other time.
127 2018-01-16 22:57:50 Credit to who? If stocks go up because of perception of trump when nothing has really changed, then it will tank as soon as the hype dies down. It may take six months, it may take a year, but the numbers are not sustainabe.
128 2018-01-16 22:57:23 And the sooner you stop treating coins like stocks, the sooner you will start to understand them.. the value is not just in the $
129 2018-01-16 22:57:15 me
130 2018-01-16 22:57:09 Golden rule - don't invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose. We all know this. Diversify and research. Take calculated risks. Invest ethically. ASX stocks are still the bulk of my portfolio. Crypto is exciting but speculative in the most part.
131 2018-01-16 22:55:31 It’s so cold, my #stocks didn’t even move.
132 2018-01-16 22:53:57 All I gotta say is that it's easy to claim that Trump has said "2000 lies" when you claim everything he says is a lie. Open your eyes, do your homework. Trump us the best thing to happen to this country since Reagan. Unemployment down. Economy up. Stocks soar. #MAGA  peace.
133 2018-01-16 22:53:53 Middle class America does not dabble in stocks and if you lift dod you will make sure the few that do will once again lose their homes
134 2018-01-16 22:52:36 I think Aerospace (& Infrastructure) type stocks  might be on ice until we know the government won't shut down on Friday.

145 2018-01-16 22:48:22 Just look at bitcoin....hyped up.... stocks went crazy high.Reality enters the picture and crash! WAlmart stocks go up when they raise salaries, goes down a week later when Sams clubs closes locations. Ups and downs are artificial. Based on hype.
146 2018-01-16 22:48:18 Now buy some stocks or a lotto ticket 
147 2018-01-16 22:47:07 Today's drawdown in #uranium stocks shows how important position sizing is. A trade position should not be too big or too small. One of the toughest aspects of #trading. Fundamentals haven't changed. $URA $FCU $NXE $UEC . A healthy uptrend needs pullbacks
148 2018-01-16 22:46:39 DAX Futures have closed below where the session opened for 5 days in a row. The run last extended to 6 days on 8 January 2016, 514 trading days ago #stocks
149 2018-01-16 22:45:12 How many are so fortunate to play the stocks?  Or have 401Ks?  Would you be able to cash in your 401K right now?  What if the market turns the other way?
150 2018-01-16 22:44:47 I’d rather be in #cryptocurrencies than equities right now.  We’ve gotten healthy sell offs with coins but stocks have never suffered greater than 5% losses in a long time.  Stocks are extremely overvalued and I’m shifting profits over to #BTC #LTC #ETC #altcoins
151 2018-01-16 22:44:47 Sad, I know Democrats who are rooting for failure even one who is getting a bonus and one who owns stocks.    You cant fix stupid.
152 2018-01-16 22:43:48 tell that to the people who can't afford stocks I'm sure they'll love knowing someone else is making a fuck load of money they'll never see
153 2018-01-16 22:43:39 er is zo'n deel van de aandelenmarkt waar dat ook best kan, penny stocks, maar ook sommige pharma's de afgelopen tijd. alleen dat is keurig verborgen
154 2018-01-16 22:43:37 Very true but at the same time ppl need to know what they getting into. A lot of ppl had false impressions this a microwave way to get rich. Like stocks it’s all a risk. It’s been worse dips than this current one so ppl just gotta weather the storm.
155 2018-01-16 22:43:36 Bush takes credit for the crash!! Stocks have been going up for over 8 years!! Obama was a senator when the crash occurred, idiot.

159 2018-01-16 22:42:40 Stocks went up 0.4 percent after an $18 billion dollar QUARTERLY loss. Wow...just wow.
160 2018-01-16 22:42:11 stocks don't go up 44% on legit rumors. Sources matter. it will be bought this week 100%.
161 2018-01-16 22:42:07 A. Most of EU fish stocks are in British waters.

162 2018-01-16 22:41:19 Met my biggest investor (some £6m+) today and discussed Ed’s presentation. We will now fully exclude fossil fuel related stocks. She was genuinely surprised that one of the funds, calling itself Ethical, would be invested in even the tiniest weeniest oil company. Time to change!

168 2018-01-16 22:36:25 @grassosteve completely agree -correlation is not causation. You can line up all kinds of coincidences to run ups or run downs in #Stocks - but #crypto & #bitcoin future isn’t going to alter the #StockMarkets fate. @timseymour ...How could you say it correlated up but now won’t?
169 2018-01-16 22:36:24 BREAKING:  Tofu stocks crashing, McDonalds, KFC and Coca Cola through the roof.
170 2018-01-16 22:36:03 Stock market rises and falls based upon perceived financial strengths and weaknesses. Watch out for the fall...stocks are going to crash when reality sets in!
171 2018-01-16 22:35:05 @CNBCFastMoney @MelissaLeeCNBC : #ChrustopherHarvey #WellFargo don't know what he's talking about. There is no correlation btwn stocks & BTC

I'll try a tip: 2018 should be a good year for gold, my opinion only, buy a couple of quality mid-tier gold stocks.
175 2018-01-16 22:33:59 If anything money coming out of cryptos will go into stocks, so no.

184 2018-01-16 22:32:33 It’s a mistake the widespread coverage @CNBC has allocated to talking #cryptos vs. talking “REAL” financial markets. This has only been a distraction.

188 2018-01-16 22:31:33 This is going to overflow to regular equities. It has to. Overstock is going to take a hit. Tech stocks will take a hit. 

I just sold TSLA to exchange for fiat into crypto at these prices. I'm sure I'm not the only one cashing out stocks to buy crypto.

196 2018-01-16 22:28:48 All my stocks are down 
197 2018-01-16 22:28:37 USD down big + stocks down: that's new!
198 2018-01-16 22:27:25 Tax cuts for big corporations will always increase value of stocks as companies use savings to buy back shares and increase dividends. That doesn’t mean that average people are making more money.
199 2018-01-16 22:26:57 Yep, I’m hearing lots of jokes about fast food stocks soaring .  When you get a chance to see all the results, it’s pretty amazing - like resting heart rate of 68, BP was 122/74 (I think that’s right - I know I’m close!).  Wish I was that healthy!
200 2018-01-16 22:26:42 2 idiots arguing. 1 can’t/won’t accept the average American can’t afford stocks and the market means nothing to them, the other believing in sky fairies.

202 2018-01-16 22:25:57 False indicator of nation's economic health. Fewer than 15% have money in the market, including those with 401(k) plans. It is driven by a few gigantic tech stocks. Recreate the companies that were in the Dow in 1980, when it crossed 1000 for the first time and see how we stand.

204 2018-01-16 22:25:19 and to clarify its not so much the upside part...its HOW it is actually trading in an intraday basis...if stocks continue price action like today for a bit..then I would call that frothy as well

208 2018-01-16 22:22:59 The difference between #cryptos and #stocks #futures #options is latter markets are for real investing & trading... while #cryptos are most speculative form of gambling outside of Vegas. I’m not against playing mainstream $BTC $ETH $LTC -but call it what it is & size accordingly.
209 2018-01-16 22:22:53 because CB's are buying stocks ...believe me I would love to see a correction in stocks...I would settle for 2% at this point

214 2018-01-16 22:21:31 You can't look at all crypto as homogeneous and accurately answer that.  Some coins have really strong use cases.  Some have limited or none.  Some are frauds/scams.  Just like stocks, but without all the regulation and fees.

221 2018-01-16 22:18:49 I don’t think it’s a coincidence that we would see “risk appetite” dry up in #Stocks today coinciding with “The Day The #Cryptos Died”. That being said, majority of quality stocks will survive & thrive while majority of #cryptocurrency besides the mainstream will go to zero.

232 2018-01-16 22:12:25 Makes sense. In my 3rd year of corn grazing and I find cows don't pull stocks out of the ground to eat, but once trampled, they will pick them up/eat them. Last year I pulled a 30' pipe behind my tractor over old corn paddocks to break off more stocks. Cows cleaned it up better

272 2018-01-16 21:56:55 Nutria system stocks will be plummeting.
273 2018-01-16 21:56:53 After hitting fresh record highs earlier in the session, Stocks close with modest losses.
274 2018-01-16 21:56:41 Oh well that sorts that then. Some other Asian lunatic owner spunking money in the midlands...I’ll be here waiting when it all ends in tears #QPR
275 2018-01-16 21:56:03 Theory: 
1. China is driving price down with crackdown announcement.
2. China stocks up on cheap cryptos
3. China announces they aren’t banning trading 
4. China profits

Thoughts?
276 2018-01-16 21:54:57 @BullFlexDaily @FinFreeFlex recently when i mention i trade stocks ppl say, oh like bitcoin!. drives me nuts. idiots
277 2018-01-16 21:54:40 Yum I love inflated stocks, so airy

281 2018-01-16 21:54:02 Stocks close lower giving up early gains as potential government shutdown looms
282 2018-01-16 21:53:53 If you call someone & exchange information about stocks, & another person you don’t know could be listening...How do you know they aren’t going to interfere or be influenced by the private conversation? Is that your *right to speak freely*? 
283 2018-01-16 21:53:46 relax we're fine. stocks had a bad day too, it's just more volatile in the crypto world.
284 2018-01-16 21:53:42 Right after such a wonderful health report, Fake news CNN still talking about S...hole. Amazing!! Let's see stocks go up while they sink in that hole they keep talking about.
285 2018-01-16 21:50:24 Why does this feel like being told I could start paying with my stocks like it's real currency?
286 2018-01-16 21:50:22 If only more people actually held stocks, this would be great.
287 2018-01-16 21:49:31 If you own stocks.
288 2018-01-16 21:49:28 This is why nobody feels bad when your stocks and cryptos go south

296 2018-01-16 21:46:45 And that my friend is why you are banned from trading stocks and giving people financial advise....
297 2018-01-16 21:46:25 The top five stocks that fell today were $UA ( $UAA ), $VIAB, $ADS, $CF, $MOS.

299 2018-01-16 21:45:40 What do corporations have to gain by being honest about their corruption? If they were, their stocks would plummet and they’d lose a crap ton of money. Hell if I were them I’d lie my ass off too if I was caught red handed. I don’t expect them to be honest and neither should you.
300 2018-01-16 21:45:36 Why should any news agency trumpet the stock exchange when 95% of stocks are owned by the top 2%?!   Only rich s...holes like 45 benefit!  #DUMPTRUMP  !!!!
301 2018-01-16 21:45:02 But #edge told me crypto up and stocks crash ? As for bubble boy - you may finally get your bubble and crash doogie MD - meanwhile Keef claiming he called it back in November and the Pres is totally fit too ....

315 2018-01-16 21:42:46 @realDonaldTrump 
I appreciate your work on the DACA act and I approve of it.
Donald Trump thank you for making our stocks increase and being a great president.
God bless American and make America great again.

316 2018-01-16 21:41:54 time to double down on stocks then
317 2018-01-16 21:41:07 I have found over & over I can only help people who help themselves - #investing #book = 344% profits last 4 years on Dow stocks - bit.l
318 2018-01-16 21:40:56 I feel like I'm changing the whole mindset of our family like we have never talked about Stocks and Politics or stuff like this until I made it a topic now we really learning and growing as a unit
319 2018-01-16 21:40:54 ........We trying it the nice way next sell off your stocks...no money ..
320 2018-01-16 21:40:22 The healthcare sector outperformed following forecast-beating results from UnitedHealth, while financials also rose as participants digested Citigroup’s earnings. But energy stocks finished sharply lower as oil prices retreated.  FT
321 2018-01-16 21:40:13 With the presidents' health report out, stocks will rise. Just watch!
322 2018-01-16 21:39:09 Ummm... again how does that help the 51% who don’t own stocks?
323 2018-01-16 21:38:46 Does anyone but ME realise how utterly fucking stupid this is? Why? I all again why make "bump stocks" illegal yet the weapon is still legal? This is like banning ALL televisions|movies in the United States but keep filming television shows and movies.
324 2018-01-16 21:38:45 A lot of this crypto action is unpredictable in comparison to stocks.  Way too news driven&anything can happen anytime given it's 24/7 nature.  How many people are losing their ass trying to catch a bounce on this tank job right now not to mention literally losing sleep over it?
325 2018-01-16 21:38:17 We're being distracted by the, 'I don't like where our England Embassy is located', 'racist', 'unstable' claims being led by the MSM while Uranium 1 indictments are handed down and the dossier is proven false. Oh, and stocks are up over 25k and our military got a 2.5% pr #MAGA
326 2018-01-16 21:38:07 Heavy heavy profit taking today!...#BuyTheDip #Stocks
327 2018-01-16 21:38:06 It's happening all over the shop Wayne. Pretty much all of my stocks at the moment 
328 2018-01-16 21:37:45 short-lived record thanks to wall street scumbags shorting stocks then dumping them(everyone else's!) Hold them accountable!
329 2018-01-16 21:37:33 It wasn't the only bubble we had. Stocks and bonds should crater now too.
330 2018-01-16 21:37:14 Yeah, trump created less jobs in his first yr than Pres Obama did in his last yr. Obama brought the unemployment rate from 9.8% to 4.7%. Most people don't own any stocks so it doesn't help. By March several companies will be laying off 1000's of employees.
331 2018-01-16 21:36:26 Canada stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/TSX Composite down 0.41%
332 2018-01-16 21:36:26 Thats the end of conversation. I Disagree, Lets agree to disagree then....I can look at a lot of other trades, but I know for sure, crypto is here for household penetration unlike Stocks, dark etc..it has to be different..it has to be superior and error free
333 2018-01-16 21:36:16 U.S. stocks lower at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.04%
334 2018-01-16 21:36:14 So what happened today? Finished in the red. #stocks #investing
335 2018-01-16 21:34:53 Have you invested in bitcoin or any stock ever? If you did, you would know that STOCKS go up and down all the time, its what makes the stock market, the stock market. Without fluctuation no one would ever make money. I'm sure I would know a little more about this than you.
336 2018-01-16 21:34:27 If this was Russia’s evil plan thank you Russia!#stocks
337 2018-01-16 21:34:24 Be sure to take credit for drop in Americans with health care coverage. Those are the Trump administration’s America First agenda is getting REAL results. Those with stocks get richer. Those without stocks get sicker. How about an AMERICANS FIRST agenda?
338 2018-01-16 21:34:15 Tax breaks for corporations, market surges that benefit those with assets in stocks, let's see how the #MAGA base comes out of all this...
339 2018-01-16 21:33:59 As things stand the fish mostly found in our waters are the ones still most at risk. We would be taking on a liability. We could choose not to fish and help stocks recover - but that doesn't help our industry, especially with reduced access to other stocks.
340 2018-01-16 21:33:44 most stocks got hammered  down today by wall street after NO bad news, nasdaq way up then way down yet again. Wall street bigs screwing us all over again. Remember 2008?
341 2018-01-16 21:33:19 Thats one reason I love stocks vs fx and futures (before crypto mania took over). You'd get up at night for whatever reason, grab our phone and next thing you know an hour has passed and the next day is a write off. #lovemysleep
342 2018-01-16 21:33:17 any blue chip stocks? Apple, IBM@maxkeiser
343 2018-01-16 21:32:49 Has nothing to do with regular workers and their salaries. The stocks are for people with 401k's and wall street investors, so stop with the false narrative.
344 2018-01-16 21:32:36 My favorite was that dude who dumped all his stocks when Trump was elected and suggested everyone else do the same.
345 2018-01-16 21:32:13 The dangers of regulating bump stocks? The dangers? What, you might save lives? You people are sick.
346 2018-01-16 21:31:48 I love my sleep.  Scalping stocks allows me to nail the quick couple K, then pass out on my bed for my #TraderNap, then pad the wallet in the afternoon while I do some pull ups then I'm done.  Money safe, no overnights.  No random 3AM dumps.

347 2018-01-16 21:31:33 The decline in our fishing industry has mostly been attributable to technology reducing the number of people needed to catch bigger hauls, plus the decline of fish stocks that we traditionally fished. EU access helped us find other stocks to fish and provided investment.
348 2018-01-16 21:30:41 I like my 401k, IRA, and Stocks.  Not something that may vanish into thin air at some point.  Oh and your weather forecasts are in my top 3 all time.  You have some competition down here in South Florida though.
349 2018-01-16 21:30:17 Exactly! Amen, just tell the truth. Black unemployment lowest in history! Stocks booming, help wanted signs everywhere, and in other good news 4 the lil tykes they can keep more of the money they earn from tax cut! The truth! I richly concur! Bravo!
350 2018-01-16 21:28:01 The law of gravity....it’s going to be devastating to many.  Watch your stocks like a hawk!
351 2018-01-16 21:26:25 My Penny stocks was mooooooooving today
352 2018-01-16 21:25:42 I understand that stocks go up and down BUT WTF is bitcoin really doing these past 2 days...
353 2018-01-16 21:24:28 4k what they giving stocks?
354 2018-01-16 21:23:28 Thanks for the answer ive been following some of your crypto calls so i got some profit to use on stocks I guess ill look up SLV more in depth looks like a nice company
355 2018-01-16 21:23:05 And in other news stocks hit 26,000
356 2018-01-16 21:23:03 Wouldn't expect them to be concerned in January. It's rare for the markets to trade these concerns in January unless stocks are so tight that they're more attuned to it.
357 2018-01-16 21:22:34 Bear markets in bonds go down 20%
Bear markets in stocks go down 50%
Bear markets in tech stocks go down 90%

Bear market in bitcoin will go down 99%
358 2018-01-16 21:21:57 Really not sure why you think that restricting our fishing grounds, especially with no control over how others fish the stocks which move between 'ours' and 'theirs' is at all beneficial.
359 2018-01-16 21:20:26 Short terms stocks you may consider researching. 2 new stocks added and yesterdays performance update.  Was in the red with yesterdays results.  New stocks added to consider researching are LRS & CKA, PNN high lighted but was already on the list.
360 2018-01-16 21:20:10 Nothing will change until people vote out the politicians that have been paid off by the NRA.  But go ahead and feel good about those bump stocks.  BS politicians pretending to do something.
361 2018-01-16 21:20:10 And by the way, I hope it does! The last major correction I bought some major blue-chip stocks at dirt cheap prices and made some decent money for a little old middle-class guy like me. Ford for $2!!  BOA for $1.50!  2009 was a good year!  
362 2018-01-16 21:20:08 @Papa_stocks $NTFL is on sale right now, impatient hands baffle me. This stock has major revenues soon to be reported.
363 2018-01-16 21:20:03 Time to go buy some more stocks
364 2018-01-16 21:19:49 Good news.
Not only is Trump healthy, he making the 401Ks of people that work healthy.
Stocks hit 26000 today!
365 2018-01-16 21:19:26 Wow. Both our POTUS and VP are idiots. The stock market is not the economy in the economy is not the stock market. One time bonuses (that not everyone is getting) and expiring tax cuts pale in comparison to a raise in wages. Plus, the top 10% own 84% of the stocks.
366 2018-01-16 21:19:05 small part of my net ”wealth” is in stocks, I make good salary, Im in prep mode for next crash. PPR/ATI is great LT bets, I know what I get
367 2018-01-16 21:18:58 #gold about to reach $1340

Profits were taken yesterday on some gold stocks, but should consolidate today.

Announcements imminent... will it be today for $DRG to break 30c and $CLY to hit 6c!!
368 2018-01-16 21:18:46 Sadly, less than 50% of Americans hold stocks.  Talk to us about wage growth. Oh, nothing to say?
369 2018-01-16 21:18:11 Sell your stocks
370 2018-01-16 21:16:57 Foreign stocks generally up; not US: Europe +.1%; US -.4%. Lower oil prices & uncertainty over government shutdown wiped out strong early rally. Perhaps some very short-term volatility before market turns higher in medium-term.
371 2018-01-16 21:16:06 @Amber_Stocks, @Sloot22, @alliequigley It's like I said before.  

Think about Top10 Players in WNBA. 

How many does MIN have in their Starting Lineup?
How many does LAS have in their Starting Lineup?
How many does PHX have in their Starting Lineup?

CHI needs 1or2. TC is Top10.
372 2018-01-16 21:15:59 Bump stocks!

374 2018-01-16 21:14:56 yeah, I’m more comfortable buying & selling traditional stocks like Tesla, Netflix, etc., at least on a week to week basis. Once the mkt bounces back though I’m making some crypto changes lol

377 2018-01-16 21:13:40 Even if they did want a more even pay playing field that was regulated you'll never have real socialism in a world with lines of credit, stocks and bonds, and crypto currency, etc. so for me it's a non issue. Even Ind. Bernie isn't really a socialist. He's just a man with no plan

380 2018-01-16 21:12:46 We need old school punishment. Place them in the stocks,in a market square,and pelt them with rotten fruit. Let them feel our anger.
381 2018-01-16 21:10:48 Wow. If I had money to buy stocks I may think that was ok. But it’s been higher

392 2018-01-16 21:07:01 I'm still in.  But I am watching the market very closely. It's been a great run for stock owners. I have reduced my stocks by about 10% over the past year because of my age.

397 2018-01-16 21:03:12 I sure have. Isn’t it great? Too bad it really benefits the wealthy the most. Tax cuts for them and stocks booming. Meanwhile, millions of children with no insurance.

403 2018-01-16 20:59:41 Year ago I warned then gf against trading stocks herself. I asked about the yield, P/E, dividend rate, small cap vs lg cap, etc ... she looked at me like I was speaking Chinese, but of course, she set up her Etrade anyways.

Her 12-mo. ROR: 37%

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

405 2018-01-16 20:59:07 Most working American's retirement stocks are invested via brokers in business holdings of the 10%, i.e. energy sectors. It's the oligarchs guarantee that Congress will keep voting in favorable policy for them.
406 2018-01-16 20:59:04 When are you going to contact me about my IRA & stocks you lost for me. It’s over 500k. You won’t take my calls. I’d suggest no one invest with them. I’m handicapped and their arrogance is making my life hell.

411 2018-01-16 20:56:06 Interesting that marijuana stocks in Canada are flying high and yet most online publishers and exchanges won't accept their ads. Will be neat to see how they build awareness.
412 2018-01-16 20:56:05 People R not interested in stocks. They want to know the numbers on:

Is crime getting less?
R the wages going up?
Will education still be affordable?
Does their insurance covers their healthcare enough.

Why should they care if rich people who actually own shares will do better?
413 2018-01-16 20:56:02 And didn’t New Jersey just bam bump stocks?! Only the 2nd State in the whole country!
414 2018-01-16 20:55:58 I’m with you. I see it similar to other investment commodities like gold, real estate, and stocks. We’re investing in a technology and it’s adoption rather than an exclusive company using it to make a product. I think the “mining” and “currency” terms confuse people. 1/2
415 2018-01-16 20:55:39 And cryptos are accessible to anyone on the globe, not just in developed countries. Unlike stocks.

418 2018-01-16 20:53:49 Completely reasonable. Neighbours having to agree fishing quotas among themselves, inside the eu or not. Fish travel across borders, need to prevent 1 nation decimating stocks b4 they travel to the next country. This is not betrayal it is rational.

456 2018-01-16 20:40:00 A lot of market manipulation and painting the tape is going on in the crypto market (probably worse than penny stocks at that point.)
But 30-40% moves - even though all the hodlers say it's all normal - mean, it can never be a currency and will forever be for speculation only.

458 2018-01-16 20:38:04 @c6thomas  i was thinking.   Maybe it has already been thought of and deemed undoable, or maybe it exist already...but.  Is there such a thing as a CryptoFund? Like a Mutual Fund for stocks.  Where you would pay into a fund that consists of 10-20 different cryptocurrencies?
459 2018-01-16 20:37:22 The stock market is up because it was trending up and nothing happened to stop the trend. The market increased more in Obama 1st year than Trump 1st year. More jobs were added in 2016 than 2017. Facts are facts whether you like them or not. Tax scam increased investment in stocks
460 2018-01-16 20:36:24 @Amber_Stocks, @Sloot22, @alliequigley The Bulls lost Horace Grant & went out & got Dennis Rodman = 3 titles.  The Sky lose Fowles & replace her with an injured rookie.  Champions know how to throw a counter-punch.  Non-contenders don't.

504 2018-01-16 20:22:20 I think some of the higher profile bigger stocks can do that: apple, google, tesla. People sign up for etrade (or whatever) to trade those, then end up buying other stocks.

509 2018-01-16 20:21:12 Firstly, Warren Buffet has a hand as he doesn't want people to move from stocks to crypto. Secondly, Binance and Bittrex stopped new registrations to curb mass adoption, "governments" behind it? Finally, all the FUD about SKorea and its crackdowns.

513 2018-01-16 20:20:30 Yeah I’d wait until you get a reasonable size. Some people can’t even afford to buy in the money options. They can only afford out of the money weeklies on certain stocks.

519 2018-01-16 20:18:08 1/Agree, great article. "investors in commodities futures are paying a dividend instead of earning it like they do in stocks and bonds." This is one of the primary issues with commodities, making them often a pure price play in a portfolio and little else. i.e. a trade

541 2018-01-16 20:11:27 Lol trickle down economics is a scam
Never actually trickles down 
They just buy back stocks to drive prices up and fill their own pockets without hiring any new people or raising wages for anyone not in an exec position

And small businesses don't get the same benefits as corps
542 2018-01-16 20:10:41 play whatever instrument it is you're analyzing. If it's a breakout in crude, buy crude, if it's a breakout in an ETF, buy the ETF, if it's a breakout in an energy stock, buy the stock. Trying to find stocks to fit a top-down thesis is really hard.
543 2018-01-16 20:10:19 @SRuhle @AliVelshi I would love to hear your thoughts on the possibility that the stock markets succesess in the last year are related to the same process that is filling Trump's bank account: that big money spenders/billionaires are "sucking up" stocks. (pun intended)

554 2018-01-16 20:06:50 It's "savior" and anything you have in stocks can be sold instantly and turned into cash at anytime. So that $10 you invested 10 years ago could be $100 or $1000. Or, that $10,000 you put in yesterday could be $20,000 today. Not sure what your looking for NOW.

559 2018-01-16 20:05:30 I agree with the idiot part, but not because they banned bump stocks today.

566 2018-01-16 20:02:35 I'm sorry to see this John.  We check our stocks regularly to prevent this from occurring. Can you let me know which of our stores you bought the item from so I can follow this up with the relevant manager? 1/2
567 2018-01-16 20:02:11 which means u always have to b looking out for which coins people r soon to put their money in. ok i guess its sort of like stocks. except the stocks is money too, and theres no government to be like "oh whoops we should stop this going down". so stuff will go down, all teh time

573 2018-01-16 20:01:07 It didn't in 2008 but that was due to suppression by the Bullion Banks. Could happen again. But I expect Stocks and Metals to fall ST but once the market gets a whiff of Fed reversal, watch both climb, especially metals.
574 2018-01-16 20:00:49 what the hell happened?
575 2018-01-16 20:00:33 Heightened tensions between Turkey and Syria could be a reason as to why Stocks are losing gains.

605 2018-01-16 19:52:41 #Stocks,#Indexes The "recovery" (below) is spurious if unsignaled.  Occurrence of a bottom signal would mean the recovery is real.

681 2018-01-16 19:25:43 I dated a girl in 2003 whose dad would faithfully dollar-cost-average into just four stocks each month. They were: DELL INTC PFE and GE.

All four had been absolutely stellar over the previous decade.
682 2018-01-16 19:25:38 Trump doesn't decide state minimum wages, stocks went up way more under Obama and all Trump has done with his corporate giveaway is explode the deficit

689 2018-01-16 19:20:36 I hope people just toss them in the trash. We don't need a photo op of the 14 bump stocks collected across the state piled up on a table with Healey in the background telling us how safe we are now.

712 2018-01-16 19:13:04 Heightened tensions between Turkey and Syria could be a reason as to why Stocks are losing gains.
713 2018-01-16 19:12:14 US stocks fall into negative territory This could be the first negative close of the year
A 20 point gain in the S&P 500 has turned into a 2 point loss.
Some profit-taking in the index has finally hit after a tremendous start to the year.
714 2018-01-16 19:12:03 S&P 500 goes negative, Cryptos start reversing. Interesting...

726 2018-01-16 19:09:00 About time there was more transparency over share holdings. Offshore vehicles used for disguise. It looks credible that 93% of world stocks are held by a small collective of interests. There's certainly no more 3%-5% of uk stock held by pensions,so don't believe that old chestnut

729 2018-01-16 19:07:35 IMO the US gov't will never suffer funding shortage.  The Fed will provide all they need, at a below-market rate.  This is what the Fed did during WWII & after (1942-51), which was also the last time US Federal debt was >100% of GDP.  It was great for stocks, but NOT for the USD.

731 2018-01-16 19:07:14 Shorting is part of the game, even though I have not a clue how to do it; if you invest in stocks that ran 3000% In a couple months and get shorted that's on you. Shorts have made me lose money in the past, and I learned from it and now I'm adapted to my surroundings. Jmo

763 2018-01-16 18:59:35 ....  50%  in FANG stocks.  And if you don’t know what it is look it up.  Then put min 20% in emerging markets.  10% in munis.  And 20% in mid cap.  No one investing in crypto is of an age they need dividend income or just a place to store capital.

802 2018-01-16 18:44:33 One of those days when my stocks are doing a heck of a lot better than my options. Wish it were the other way around. I don't wish to lose in either; just that one is short-term and the other is long-term.
803 2018-01-16 18:44:04 breaking down 189.6 is not good. next support level is 181. still room to drop. if can't hold 181, back to 177.6
804 2018-01-16 18:43:48 Imma start reading about stocks and how to invest in things.
805 2018-01-16 18:43:48 Tide stocks about to blow up like Bitcoin
806 2018-01-16 18:43:46 @SBarlow_ROB Scott, today's headline story about 13 stocks that will "explode" in '18 requires a subscription to Business Insider Prime service. I'm not sure as a G&M subscriber I want Globe headlines directing me to another paid service. Am I being unrealistic? #Ialreadypay

808 2018-01-16 18:42:43 Same dumb fucking comments will emerge when stocks fall too.
809 2018-01-16 18:42:42 Once upon a time this news would be welcomed by a large number of citizens. Those days are long past, and best data shows that less than 20% of the US population owns stocks. Guess who does own stocks? 89%of persons of worth more than a $1,000,000.00 do. #notgoodnews4everyone

814 2018-01-16 18:41:32 The NOPA crush report for Dec 2018 was about 1 million bushels greater than trade expectations. Soybean oil stocks were much higher than the avg. trade outlook, although fairly close to our forecast. The report was friendly for soybean & meal prices, but bearish for soybean oil.
815 2018-01-16 18:41:26 Bad story! No correlation with Trump. Coincidence! Also too much money in fat cat stock speculators' hands! Or gross class divide with most wealth in hands of few who are pushing stocks to new highs.

823 2018-01-16 18:38:11 This is a thread about the labor market. Most Americans own no stocks. Most Americans earn their living working for people who own stock. Jobs & wages are what matter most.
824 2018-01-16 18:37:26 Yeah not a nice situation. Your buys in US clearly very shrewd. I suspect many getting caught by not having a mix of strategies. eg if have all Momentum Stocks it's gonna be hurting now. I try to diversify in many ways.

880 2018-01-16 18:14:24 In my opinion the very rich love the boom-bust cycle.  They profit from stocks during the rise and then have cash to buy up stuff  (like properties after the housing crash) when things plummet.  It's a win win for those with massive capital on hand.

941 2018-01-16 17:55:58 Could crypto currencies just be a new breed of penny stocks?

944 2018-01-16 17:54:17 Ugh, terrible. Nobody's 401k should be wiped out, that should be illegal. Younger people will usually pick high risk investments (more in stocks) and gradually move those into safer investments as they mature.
945 2018-01-16 17:54:09 @NVIDIAGeForce When are your stocks going to be full on the NVIDIA site!? I've got my cash ready but there's none for me to buy. :(
946 2018-01-16 17:53:22 Trump says Economy doing better or "best ever" via Wall Street Stocks up, less unemployment, New Tax Reform and a whole bunch of things Trump takes credit for these days!  So let's raise the interest rates on small businesses and corporations? Right Trump?
947 2018-01-16 17:53:03 my trade is for the week will be

i like them to raise more dough in dia stocks so we get a good pro gap looking for c s c o type action

951 2018-01-16 17:51:42 Great advice on CBNC this morning Nili Gilbert. “Don’t chase risky stocks!”
952 2018-01-16 17:51:26 Always looking to wrap a cloud around every silver lining, in light of today's 26000 Dow, CNN Money notes that "Barely one third of families in the bottom 50% of earners own stocks either directly or indirectly. " But of course the bottom half pay less than 12 % of all taxes.
953 2018-01-16 17:50:56 $MYSZ $2.95 +38%
954 2018-01-16 17:50:32 My stocks are doing so welllll :-)
955 2018-01-16 17:49:46 "Don't chase risky stocks"
Talk about the most useless, inane advice...
956 2018-01-16 17:49:44 Yep but the sad sad truth is how many people know how that US dollar gets created, the cost, and how inflation affects it?If they did they would be buying a lot more into crypto like you just said. Torn between 70 % stocks / ETF’s and only 30% crypto. 50/50 or 60/40 but family 
957 2018-01-16 17:49:43 If anybody is looking for a long term investment in stocks ITUS is the company to buy thank me later
958 2018-01-16 17:49:22 SWISS NATIONAL BANK'S JORDAN SAYS DOES NOT SEES CRYPTO CURRENCIES CURRENTLY AS A RISK

Sure b/c the Zug unicorn foundations like Tezos sold their cryptos for stocks, bonds and precious metals.
959 2018-01-16 17:48:59 Do I think the recent evidence (elevated sentiment, extended indexes/stocks, two gaps up in three days, huge # of new highs) raises the odds of a pullback/consolidation? Yes. Am I taking much action because of that? No, though I still think it's best to be choosy on the buy side.

961 2018-01-16 17:47:47 Agreed, Many who bought crypto also bought stocks so if pain comes it will spread
962 2018-01-16 17:47:32 China owns lots of American companies stocks...they are getting a nice cut from the Trump tax cuts... they will take that money and lend it back to the USA to cover the budget deficit ... the genius of Trump.
963 2018-01-16 17:47:23 The Dow has virtually no effect on the real economy. The top 10% of Americans own 80% of stocks. You know this, sir, so stop lying and do something for the other 90% of Americans.
964 2018-01-16 17:47:04 BTC crashes -> 
people who took out mortgages to buy BTC are down 50% -> 
deleveraging -> 
spending slows -> 
asset prices fall -> 
"wealth" disappears ->
rates tick up -> 
auto and credit card debt interest rises -> 
spending slows more ->
stocks sell off ->
starts over again
965 2018-01-16 17:45:16 @themotleyfool @jimcramer Check out $EXPI - it’s the NetFlix of Real Estate stocks
966 2018-01-16 17:44:54 @TheStreet @jimcramer Check out $EXPI - it’s the NetFlix of Real Estate stocks
967 2018-01-16 17:44:42 That’s a solid bet, and I’m sure it made sense at the time. I would guess that, even though stocks aren’t cheap here, the manic & inexperienced “cowboy speculators” are all in on cryptos & not stocks.
968 2018-01-16 17:43:59 @jimcramer Check out $EXPI - it’s the NetFlix of Real Estate stocks
969 2018-01-16 17:43:12 Interesting topic today is stocks. :)
970 2018-01-16 17:42:55 ...through selection, diversification and allocation criteria. Selection of only those stocks which display great earnings and price growth. Adequately diversified to avoid damage from few bad apples. And not remaining invested always. 4/4
971 2018-01-16 17:42:01 It's fairly common every few months, but yes, to someone who regularly traded on the stocks back in the day, if we had a day like this in the city, it would be remembered for eternity as the worst day of all time.
972 2018-01-16 17:41:52 Must be great if you invest in the market. Pretty sure average Joe on his 40,000 a year job ain’t buying tech stocks...schmuck.
973 2018-01-16 17:41:48 Yes I have thanks. Would just be useful sometimes to see what margin requirements are for individual stocks via the app
974 2018-01-16 17:41:35 Yeay for rich people with stocks!!
975 2018-01-16 17:41:34 LABU/LABD trades are so easy why even screw with individual stocks.
976 2018-01-16 17:41:22 It's just a tactic to make the stock market drop. Does anyone really think he sold his stocks NOT
977 2018-01-16 17:41:20 he will finish this term and is headed for a second..the economy is what matters..Trump lowered my taxes, my 401K has gone crazy and stocks I bought when I went to work for WM went from $35 to over $100...
978 2018-01-16 17:40:41 UR vileTHE POINT is GDP is up,stocks are up, unemployment down. No context,no interpretation needed. Math facts! All of UR ridiculously obtuse. WE had 2 candidates. 1 has been CLEARLY proven 2 have used office 4$,sold our country(&its party) OUT. Other has demonstratable results
979 2018-01-16 17:40:33 Newbies you really need to learn charting and l2.  It will give you great piece of mind when you understand Charting, and see for yourself how stocks run up, come down, find new bases, consolidate (aka churn), then run up and find higher highs--The good ones that is!
980 2018-01-16 17:39:32 Yet when I do this with penny stocks suddenly I’m “committing fraud” and having to “explain myself to the SEC”
981 2018-01-16 17:39:24 ....We trying it the nice way next sell off your stocks...no money ..
982 2018-01-16 17:38:37 So they are making a #forex bet that $DXY will be debased by Trump administration for next three years. Better to short $DXY than buying stocks.
983 2018-01-16 17:38:18 The MSM are either down playing or not mentioning how big of a deal it is that the #DowJones hit 26K today. Yes, rich ppl w/ stocks are getting richer, but the MIDDLE CLASS are benefiting as well...55+M AMERICANS have 401K plans & 25+M have retirement accounts invested in stocks.
984 2018-01-16 17:38:03 Stock Market has always went up and down . It bursts when people can’t control their greed . I don’t hear anyone with stocks complaining . And  it will effect the 401 Ks . Breaking modern time records ? Last big rise in 90s really had no foundation
985 2018-01-16 17:37:59 Maybe imprison more Drug Company executives since their the reason you've an opioid crisis in your country? Oh wait, that'd harm your precious stock market. Stocks before people.
986 2018-01-16 17:37:47 Yeah, sorry about that! Although it was the most horribly turbulent flight and I did envisage the obit from @chickenhsebooks “Author Predicts Own Death on Twitter (books still available while stocks last)”
987 2018-01-16 17:37:25 If the privately-owned Daily Mail has the right to choose what it prints, why doesn't the privately-owned @VirginTrains have the freedom to choose which newspapers it stocks? Does the Daily Mail give its readers a choice of stories and opinions within its pages? Um..
988 2018-01-16 17:37:21 “When it comes to  the value of those stocks, the top 10% of Americans hold four times as much as the bottom 90%. The top 1% alone holds twice as much value as the bottom 90%. That’s where most of the benefit to an increase in stock values goes.”

Who benefits? Billionaires.
989 2018-01-16 17:37:06 GREAT. Stocks Up once again. Jobs up for BLACKS ,Great.when did the dems EVER do that. Never. Things I hope will turn around 4 Trump Feb.

1003 2018-01-16 17:33:47 The Inverse Relationship Between #Stocks & #Yields: Yields (interest rates) opened lower, giving the markets a sharp gap higher. Yields have since rallied continuously higher. #Markets have faded lower all morning. Watch this closely. #Stocks #InterestRates #FederalReserve
1004 2018-01-16 17:33:44 Doesn’t matter if you own stocks or not the DOW has a tremendous effect on the economy & that effects those living paycheck to paycheck

1017 2018-01-16 17:27:39 Now if she was as passionate about Black peoples struggles as she wants us to believe she is when soliciting our votes, the stocks for private owned prisons should have been the least of her concerns.
1018 2018-01-16 17:27:08 I would be really nice if you could remove fractions of NEO!!!! If you only had $50-100 to invest your stuck on exchanges!  All the large crypto allow fractions, stocks/shares allow fractions precious metals also!!  Your going to lose investors as the price goes up me as one!!!!
1019 2018-01-16 17:27:01 really sick bro, but tbh, slowly getting annoyed by the same stocks and pngs if you feel me, e.g the skull
1020 2018-01-16 17:26:39 Great news for rich folks with stocks.
1021 2018-01-16 17:26:15 Durbin lied?  You know this for a fact, how?  Were you in the room or do you just prefer not to believe him.  
Trump's economy is still swinging on Obama's pendulum.  Companies are buying back their own stocks to keep them artificially high.
1022 2018-01-16 17:25:56 Hey Senators Cotton and Perdue.  You both sound completely stupid and history books will highlight how you and others are willing to become laughing stocks to protect our imbecile President.
1023 2018-01-16 17:25:54 Shows how little you know. You may not own stocks but they have tremendous effect on the economy which your paycheck depends on
1024 2018-01-16 17:25:14 You must not have stocks either. 
1025 2018-01-16 17:25:09 @DougKass Whats of interest is what does the ETF place in its basket of holdings? Most of the companies being called “crypto” stocks don’t really have any blockchain business or just have a PR

1034 2018-01-16 17:21:55 The stock market is not the same as the economy. The economy is due to the previous administration and the stock market is a combination of both past and present. When stocks go down Trump never takes blame or credit for that, does he.
1035 2018-01-16 17:20:48 ... now, I realize that major stocks behave differently. Much more seasoned market. Bull run is getting pretty long.

1038 2018-01-16 17:19:40 It's not about "shared waters". It's about OUR territorial waters returning to OUR control, so we control OUR stocks.
Fish stocks declined massively when other countries were allowed into UK waters, and emergency measures had to be introduced, which killed our fishing industry.

1043 2018-01-16 17:18:45 Alan Greenspan made his famous 'Irrational Exuberance' comment on December 6, 1996, during a televised speech. (was interpreted as a warning for inflated prices)

Stocks continued going up for another 3.5 years after that. (via CNBC)
1044 2018-01-16 17:18:39 I HOPE EVERYONE WHOM TRADES MJ STOCKS UNDERSTANDS THAT AFTER A HEAVY SELL OFF THAT LAST FOR OVER A WEEK,ALL RALLIES WOULD BE SOLD INTO,THIS IS WHERE THE SMART MONEY ACCUMULATES THEIR SHARES BEFORE THE REAL RALLY BEGINS !!!
1045 2018-01-16 17:18:26 PORTFOLIO up 0.2% today - quite mixed really but few big moves. Having said that my Stocks had no real news today so that's a key factor out.
1046 2018-01-16 17:18:09 the stock market is only a gage of how the rich are doing...it has little to no bearing on the middle class or the poor. they don't own stocks

1049 2018-01-16 17:17:48 I thought this was all wrapped up, you know lone wolf 64 yo accountants are massacring people all the time with bump stocks and then ripping out hard drives before suiciding themselves.
1050 2018-01-16 17:17:30 Yes the mkt is off the high but all the momo stocks I monitor are still well into green territory. Only one giving up so far is $baba
1051 2018-01-16 17:16:57 $icm and $aaz solid lithium stocks. Don't be a penny flippers when you have gems in hands cause you ll never be back after selling.
1052 2018-01-16 17:16:16 Use at your own risk labels. These aren't stocks or securities. They exist precisely because the machinations of government destroys the integrity of money.  Central banks exist independent of governments for the same reason but fail because central control is corruptible.
1053 2018-01-16 17:16:11 I’m trying to get rich but these stocks don’t want to cooperate 
1054 2018-01-16 17:16:04 You are trying to tell me a majority of trump supporters don’t own stocks, or 401ks, or pensions?   Source this please
1055 2018-01-16 17:15:41 $GME wish i could short in my 401k,these crappy stocks are layups,every pop is sold,SVU also

1059 2018-01-16 17:14:42 Thanks to @POTUS my stocks have risen so that I maybe able to retire when I hit that age instead of having to work until I'm 80.
1060 2018-01-16 17:14:30 $UAV moving back up again at .205. UAV will be the stock of 2018 imo
1061 2018-01-16 17:14:12 It means a lot to 50 million who are invested in stocks!
1062 2018-01-16 17:13:32 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $UA ( $UAA ), $CF, $VIAB, $MOS, and $ADS.
1063 2018-01-16 17:13:25 Thanks for getting back. Fitbit Ionic should be available for purchase on 2018. We highly suggest contact the authorize near you for their stocks. Hope this helps.
1064 2018-01-16 17:13:10 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS
1065 2018-01-16 17:12:26 My brokerage makes me call them to buy OTC stocks. And they wont let me put them in my tax sheltered accounts.  So an OTC stock has to be really interesting to rope me in.

1069 2018-01-16 17:11:59 True, but it can still be modeled within reason for useful purposes.  Things like household allocations and so forth don't make much difference in markets like the UK, where stocks are majority foreign-owned.

Never say there can't be smart gun laws
1074 2018-01-16 17:09:57 Steph actually reads the earnings and values stocks based on that, something massively changed to asses value on the last month, chart analysis has had no metric change their cues. Neither is wrong or right.
1075 2018-01-16 17:09:27 Wow so many great stocks in the red today. Hope people had some cash tucked away for a day like this!
1076 2018-01-16 17:09:03 Or you could just buy from a different store that stocks Gucci

1078 2018-01-16 17:08:37 Ok.....if you say so.  I still need access to the traditional banking system to accomplish the goals that I have.  I'm less worried about buying cups of coffee with bitcoin than I am being able to buy stocks, cars, houses, etc.

1082 2018-01-16 17:08:17 Stocks up, economy up, majority of Americans joy up, win win ;)
1083 2018-01-16 17:08:09 Too many equate a high stock market with a good or robust economy. You’re correct. They are not equivalent. How can the lowest wage earners benefit from high stock values if they can’t afford stocks?
1084 2018-01-16 17:08:00 Yes, most brokerages allow you to invest in foreign stocks and funds
1085 2018-01-16 17:06:24 I like to use high-low-close quarterly bar charts going back to the mid 1980s with just a linear regression line...the stocks that I select should have at least 15 years of trading history
1086 2018-01-16 17:06:08 Local news story about how tech, finance and healthcare are where all the jobs are. I've seen how finance expands as a portion of GDP when stocks are high, and I think it's parasitic past ~5%. Healthcare is at least twice of what it "should" be, GDP-wise (compared to Norway).

1090 2018-01-16 17:03:34 #TuesdayThoughts the #dow26k is a result of interest compounding? Only people with stocks will reap any benefit. Not a measure of abililty to get by, but of wealth
1091 2018-01-16 17:03:33 It's far more important that you are a traitor to the United States of America than that the rich people who own 83% of stocks are getting richer. I can't wait for you to die in prison.
1092 2018-01-16 17:03:25 The DOW is climbing due in large part to health insurance stocks.  Gee, I wonder why they expect higher profits? 
Must be the 13 million about to be dumped and a big premiums rise around the corner. #thankstrump

1095 2018-01-16 17:02:34 Good for you Mr. Huckabee, & the 54% of Americans who own some form of stocks. But for the 46% of folks who own ZERO investments, this rise in stock market does nothing for them.

1102 2018-01-16 17:00:28 Just wondering how many stocks this guy owns...
1103 2018-01-16 17:00:27 Are you coming out as and S instead if an M? Cause I gotta know b4 I sell those Swaps stocks.
1104 2018-01-16 16:59:58 Uh, the Dow Jones isn’t the economy. That’s like saying a guy is a good basketball player because he can dunk.
Stocks did well under O from low int rates/high inflation. Low int rates made stocks the only place gains could be made from savings. Inflation is self explainitory.
1105 2018-01-16 16:59:28 the clatter or rattle taking its place at market money wont stop ever stocks prices sometimes skidded
1106 2018-01-16 16:59:27 Then you should invest in stocks.
1107 2018-01-16 16:58:44 This proves no such thing. How many people living at, or near, poverty levels own stocks? How many unemployed people own stocks? All this proves is that the tax bill allowed big corps to rebuy their own stocks. This while laying ppl off. #Sad #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachPence

1122 2018-01-16 16:51:36 I did respond to you and pointed out that your graphics on money is an issue of people owning stocks.  buying power is an issue of inflation not an issue of who has the most money.  extreme rich don't buy a Chevy cavalier so it is priced for those that do.  same for other items
1123 2018-01-16 16:51:31 How many Americans owns stocks ?

Way to go @realDonaldTrump You're doing a FANTASTIC job! Sadly, some are just so filled with hate they're blinded to the good you're doing.
1129 2018-01-16 16:48:47 Answer his question? How does this help blue collar workers with no stock portfolio?

Yes, my stocks are great but all in 401k so I can’t touch until I retire. That doesn’t help me right now.
1130 2018-01-16 16:48:30 I have watched reverse mergers like $embr take stocks up 1,000s%
1131 2018-01-16 16:47:58 yeaaaaah...pretty much a slow decline until news hits the wire...but keep in mind that this company was the underwriter for at least 3 NASDAQ stocks that are in the high dollar amount. $NTFL is a highly profitable co. that just need 1 PR and then POW!
1132 2018-01-16 16:47:51 Anywho... forget him, let’s talk about the money. How are the #stocks looking this week? Did the #Dubai Mars project launch yet? #space
1133 2018-01-16 16:46:34 The problem in a runaway #bull market is that too much money (and too much credit) is chasing too few stocks in virtually every sector of economy. And whenever there is too much money on the table, the crooks come out of the woodwork.
1134 2018-01-16 16:46:10 yeah followed with some calls & stocks as well
1135 2018-01-16 16:45:57 I think it will take longer, crypto infrastructure is much harder than stocks.  plus will it only trade during business hours?
1136 2018-01-16 16:45:27 You wouldn’t use tfsa for large gainers like pot stocks?

1151 2018-01-16 16:42:08 93% of all stocks are owned by top 10% wealthiest, so they reap nearly ALL these benefits! Some middle class have 401Ks, but anyone under 65 will receive only temporary paper gains. Why not do something that REALLY helps working people, like cutting payroll taxes, as Obama did?
1152 2018-01-16 16:41:50 I’m buying stocks this year
1153 2018-01-16 16:41:40 Remember. Stocks don't go straight up. I trust my DD and well these dips come, I buy. It's already bouncing from lows

1159 2018-01-16 16:39:26 Do you understand that when stocks are up, so is your 401k?
1160 2018-01-16 16:39:13 Make the rich more rich! 50% of Americans do not own ANY stocks nor do they have a 401K with stocks. Trump family and friends benefit.
1161 2018-01-16 16:39:09 That's really meaningful to people who go paycheck to paycheck. They don't own stocks.
1162 2018-01-16 16:38:59 It can go down for a day, but stocks have reached a permanently high plateau. Is that plagiarism?

1168 2018-01-16 16:36:13 Stock market gains are not realized until the underlying stocks are sold. 
How much of this is manufactured profit - proprietary trading, propping up share prices and Wall Street price manipulation?

1180 2018-01-16 16:34:12 In case you're too stubborn to read the article:  ."Stocks traded sharply higher as investors chased a market breaking out on better-than-expected earnings and rising economic optimism under President Donald Trump."

1185 2018-01-16 16:32:37 Not once in 10 years did I see a post from my Facebook friends about stocks, the market, etc. In the last month, I see something related cryptocurrency at least once a week.
1186 2018-01-16 16:31:51 Cause bonds and stocks were both up at opening.
1187 2018-01-16 16:31:31 They do talk about the economic boost.
What I see is a huge bubble that is going to leave millions of people broke from buying into stocks that will burst thank you for

1206 2018-01-16 16:27:48 Typical Tuesday. Lots of stocks taking a breather. We have to remember that stocks don't go straight up and to buy on dips.
1207 2018-01-16 16:27:26 Seems there's  no more potential stocks now in short term ,BABA,then AAPL?
1208 2018-01-16 16:27:25 Too complicated. People buy stocks that trade at $5 and not ones that trade at $150 cos the 5$ stock is “cheap”. They bought stocks in 2000 cos “they may split soon”. Buy balloon loans cos the rate is too low. Etc

1210 2018-01-16 16:27:08 I need to get into stocks
1211 2018-01-16 16:27:07 yup all those stocks that all the low and middle class own are making them rich ... oh wait. #richgetricher
1212 2018-01-16 16:27:01 How could stocks ever not go up?
1213 2018-01-16 16:26:47 It’s a rich get richer story. A Republican scam trying to sell us that Wall Street is Main Street. If skyrocketing stocks is great for everyone then why do they fight raising minimum wage? Why do we all have to pay a bigger and bigger portion of our company sponsored health care?
1214 2018-01-16 16:26:37 We want to talk about your racist remarks, your cruel Dacca initiative, the fact you never addressed Hawaii, the idea that you played golf instead of honoring #mlk and that you conspired with Russia to steal the election. Stocks and bonds only help the rich.
1215 2018-01-16 16:26:34 you should not be in biotech if you are looking to day trade. Lots of better stocks out there for day trading.
1216 2018-01-16 16:25:53 When is the coin launch?
1217 2018-01-16 16:25:45 Nice to have stocks though isn't it.

1224 2018-01-16 16:23:37 FI, I have been holding one of the stocks in my portfolio since 2012. 
With zero debt levels, it didn't show much appreciation till May 2017. 

And then, it zoomed to 200 in Jan 2018 after facing a stagnation at 38.
I haven't sold it yet as there is still a lot of steam left.
1225 2018-01-16 16:23:23 It begins. First they took away our bump stocks....
1226 2018-01-16 16:23:21 $VIX index up nearly 11% today with the S&P 500 up as well.  Is the VIX broken?

Nope.  Remember the VIX is just a statistic, a forward implied volatility indicator, but it is directionless.  It can and does sometimes go up when stocks go up.

1227 2018-01-16 16:22:38 Is Mbanje stocks code for something? Loool
1228 2018-01-16 16:22:19 Obama is responsible for stocks?? Are you kidding? 8 yrs Obama had to grow this country. We went backwards. Soon as Trump wins stocks soar! It's not rocket science
1229 2018-01-16 16:22:04 Today’s economy is structurally different than 1920s, so Trump’s actions similar to those taken in the 1920s, may have a different result. A problem then was the move from investment instruments like stocks, to speculative instruments like futures, & options with high margins.
1230 2018-01-16 16:21:40 Its easy.Just look back at what they said right before the election.All left leaning networks said stocks would tank if Trump wins.
1231 2018-01-16 16:21:06 The VIX is based on CBOE options activity and not economic activity.  A lot of systems roll LEAPs this week and want some volatility to do so.  Any movement in stocks because of VIX deltas is lightweights making decisions.
1232 2018-01-16 16:20:09 Will the Stock Market Crash in 2018, considering the rising valuations of stocks, in my opinion, we are due for a great crash of 2018? #greatcrashof2018 #StockMarket #USA
1233 2018-01-16 16:19:37 For who?  80% of US stocks owned by top 1%  and 20% of US stocks owned by foreigners. Wages r still not keeping up with inflation and job growth slowed under Trump. So Trump is taking care of “forgotten Americans” by making Goldman Sachs & himself richer. Awesome
1234 2018-01-16 16:19:04 Assuming they are retiring today. Who knows what will happen tomorrow. There can be a bust and people can lose it all, just like they did under Bush. That said, most of USA doesn't have a 401K or own stocks.
1235 2018-01-16 16:19:02 Millions of non-rich Americans have retirement accounts invested in stocks.

Stock buybacks and increased dividends, increase stock price.

I am by no means wealthy. My retirement accounts have increased by more than my entire yearly tax bill since the bill was passed.
1236 2018-01-16 16:18:55 If crypto died before getting bigger, that should be bullish stocks.
1237 2018-01-16 16:18:02 The Dow Jones Industrial Average just went up 1,000 points in a WEEK and blew through 26,000 for the first time in history! Remember that 60% of traded stocks are held by retirement plans!
1238 2018-01-16 16:17:51 The only people who “gets it”, ie believes your lies, is your tiny little base. Still at a 39% approval rating. Pathetic. You came in with a great an ever improving economy. Stocks increase bc the rich know you’ll make *them* richer. And the Mueller investigation is going strong.

1246 2018-01-16 16:14:05 They do every single day on CNN and MSNBC. Every single day, multiple times a day. That said over half of Americans do not have a 401K or stocks. Anything else?
1247 2018-01-16 16:13:54 I still don't get the explosive value assigned to them, but I've been willing to play them like stocks with money I don't mind losing. That includes the dollar cost averaging you're up to.
1248 2018-01-16 16:13:53 The reason people are freaking out is because they use lower time@frames plusnthey think price is rising and will never fall checking it every single minute..... if you trade stocks it’s pretty much easier the only thing is his industry is extrmely@volatile so  research is key
1249 2018-01-16 16:13:38 I need to get into stocks ASAP!

1253 2018-01-16 16:11:02 @IndivisibleIowa @IndivisibleNEIA Look!  Real people are dissing her now. Can Iowans be any bigger laughing stocks? Between this dummy (Norway is NOT bordered by Russia, btw) & Grassley, we look like idiots to the rest of the nation.
1254 2018-01-16 16:10:59 I’ve been using Scotia since mid 90s (ScotiaMcLeod Discount Brokerage, which merged with eTrade to be iTRADE). Since day 1, I have been trading US$ and C$ stocks in native funds. These are unregistered funds - not TFSAs or RRSP. I wouldn’t put pot stocks in TFSAs/RRSPs.

1258 2018-01-16 16:09:41 I found $140,000,000 that doesn’t count the assets in her husband’s name, stocks, Napa real estate, ski resorts....while she considers 1000 bucks as #Crumbs, she exposes her rich elite attitude toward the less affluent.
1259 2018-01-16 16:09:16 Actually #DementiaDonald, they cover it all the time. It’s just that the majority of America do not own stocks and bonds and therefore see no benefit.

1266 2018-01-16 16:07:08 Apparently there is a 5 day wait time to set up TFSAs (Tax Free Savings Accounts) at TD in Toronto because of a rush to buy pot stocks (as per advisor)
1267 2018-01-16 16:07:04 Ah, a believer's belief is Irrelevant... Compared to value. Exchange depends on others... Unregulated casino of penny stocks... Compelling to weak and strong minded.

1270 2018-01-16 16:05:58 Market is attempting an reaction rally on all minor or major intraday undercuts. Usually they work out well and a change of character in this regard could be a bad omen for the market. My guess is that the gap will fill eventually today. #stocks

1276 2018-01-16 16:03:16 No they do not. Plus now corporations will buy back stocks, send jobs overseas and give wonderfully large bonuses to ceos while the workers suffers
1277 2018-01-16 16:02:59 Perhaps intentions are for gain but short of a war? They may assume that military will spot an error before retaliation. But what if key places during an election receive attack warnings? People would be saying goodbye to loved ones, not voting. Or to trade stocks, come to that.
1278 2018-01-16 16:01:53 Silently the rich DEMocrats in office are thrilled that the Dow hit 26K. Their stocks, funds and portfolios are making tons of money in interest. You know who you are.
1279 2018-01-16 16:01:06 I mean that's rule 1 of any investment, the story of the bartender is sad but we've heard it all even in relation to regulated stocks, shares and commodities.

1281 2018-01-16 16:01:00 Ahh FFS why do anyone care about bumb stocks? Its a piece of crap plastic which makes it easier to bumpfire a semiauto-weapon which means faster rate of fire but less precision regarding hitting something. Bumpfire can also be done completely without a bumpstock.
1282 2018-01-16 15:59:30 Because real estate is about the only thing of value left in this country. The US Dollar is not a wise investment. US stocks depend on the economy  not collapsing. Keep printing money out of thin air, until it collapses. But people are always gonna need a place to live.

1309 2018-01-16 15:48:58 And of course diaper stocks will go through the roof!!!
1310 2018-01-16 15:48:25 Yeah, the "group of people" that Juan (I really don't understand the American large business economic segment) if anything is the millions of us who own stocks or mutual fund shares. Fortune 500 company leaders is really a small group of people.

So why should I care about stocks?  Because it makes rich people richer?  Yea I'll let you know when I start to see the "trickle"
1323 2018-01-16 15:44:52 No not everyone benefits. Only the rich and those who own stock or investments in stocks. The poor is suffering, the disabled, and the children of the poor. But who cares?  Right?
1324 2018-01-16 15:44:43 Thank you. When daytrading the stocks people “know” I like to look at a statistically relevant no one day catalyst event (psychology). That’s why I faded. It’s attacking $180 again. That resolution gets me interested again.

1399 2018-01-16 15:25:11 That's not entirely true. If you have a 401k or an IRA, you probably are somewhat invested in stocks. You could also open an account and trade but most people don't have the cash available to them for this.

1401 2018-01-16 15:24:54 Business analysis is not an exact science. That is why some banks can recommend you buy certain stocks while others urge you to do the opposite. As a banker, as someone who looks at these sorts of numbers, my interpretation is thus.

1404 2018-01-16 15:24:39 My (admittedly small) understanding of the market is: if stocks are stable and rising, gold goes down and vice versa. For both to rise at the same time shows stock people are hedging their bets and buying gold at the same time cuz they don't trust the rise in the market.

1501 2018-01-16 15:02:07 Interesting piece, Josh.

"Information Technology stocks, as of the latest reading, had become 24% of the S&P 500 by the end of 2017. They were just 15% in 2006 and close to 10% at the end of 2000."

Wanted to clarify that IT accounted for 35% of the S&P 500 in March 2000.
1502 2018-01-16 15:02:02 Dow is at record highs but I doubt much of the money being cashed out of cryptos is being invested in stocks today.

1538 2018-01-16 14:57:10 It's statistically true, though. The other 20% of stocks in the US are owned by the remaining top 40%.  In other words 150,000,000 people do not own any stocks at all and they're the ones that need the most help. It's only a silver lining to the people that already have money.
1539 2018-01-16 14:57:08 It’s a currency. They don’t fluctuate like that. The euro and dollar don’t fluctuate. So it’s a STOCK. And stocks fluctuate heavy. Very common. So you do deserve it.

1605 2018-01-16 14:44:48 yea, i mean usually for stocks and commodities this is the case as firms like to mark books for year end.  I am not sure how that applies to crypto but that seasonality chart makes sense being the data is correct.

1624 2018-01-16 14:41:12 Bears take note $AMZN is one of the best stocks you can buy. It’s costly but worth it because of potential and possible gains 
1625 2018-01-16 14:40:30 You're not grasping that without shorting, for every trade there has to be a buyer and a seller. Once you allow shorting, for every buyer you need either a seller or a shorter; so the effect of the shorted stocks is to increase supply. Like I said, EFFECTIVELY increasing supply.

1635 2018-01-16 14:38:57 Pbay. I generally like your tweets and you seem like an experienced person with stocks. Question is why the beef with $SX? Seems like you just like being the contrarian on a lot of your posts. The LOI is pretty standard before a final deal is done, not sure what the issue is?
1636 2018-01-16 14:38:50 Expensive stocks can always get more expensive. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made his famous “irrational exuberance” comments in late 1996, and stocks went on to double in price again before eventually crashing in 2000.

Above-ground stocks are relevant, of course, but that is a different metric.
1646 2018-01-16 14:36:18 Do you have a degree in economics?
Gas prices are rising. Stocks have almost nothing to do with ANY president.

1706 2018-01-16 14:24:15 Bitcoin is getting HAMMERED. 
Stocks poised to move upwards. let's go!
1707 2018-01-16 14:23:38 Keep griping.  They are covering exactly what they need to.  IE question your actions and show how you and your GOP buddies are now raping our economy.  Sure Stocks are up. only helps investors, Bonuses are diversion as layoffs continue.  PLEASE READ
1708 2018-01-16 14:23:28 You are an idiot. The media has never covered the stock market much, and the stock market does NOT equal the economy.   You are just begging to have your ego stroked. But since most people have little to nothing in stocks, or a401k... that would be meaningless.
1709 2018-01-16 14:23:25 Second home communion done. Now at Matalan to pick up lent talks (while stocks last, just next to the pillow section) #bellplacement
1710 2018-01-16 14:23:09 You don't get it. The forgotten man and woman do not own stocks. All we have are low wage jobs.
1711 2018-01-16 14:22:33 DAMING STOCKS...
1712 2018-01-16 14:22:03 No. Stocks.
1713 2018-01-16 14:21:03 so far with suretrader, noticing that they restrict margin on volatile stocks which blows. many stocks are 1:1 margin which with a small account makes it not tradable.
1714 2018-01-16 14:21:02 Yeah, I rarely trade company fundamentals unless I see something really enticing (like proof that the company is real deal).  But timing is everything with stocks under $10 in general I've found.   But from .03 cents a 50% move is pretty easy to see
1715 2018-01-16 14:20:54 New baseball caps for #markets ?

With #stocks futures up strongly, the #Dow is set to open above 26,000 for the first time...which would also mark a notably rapid move from 25,000. 
Rather than rise, the yield on US 10-year #bonds is 2 bps lower at 2.53%.
#Bitcoins are down 12%.

1724 2018-01-16 14:18:17 @carlquintanilla - Big Name stocks trading at hundreds of times trailing earnings - aren't we getting just a tad frothy ?
1725 2018-01-16 14:17:56 Precisely. Difference between Sept 1 SRW stocks and Dec 1 SRW Stocks of -8.45% is smallest q/q change for that period since 2010/11 and 3rd smallest since at least 1986/87.

1795 2018-01-16 13:48:18 So here is my thoughts on BTC
Its only value is that it must go up
Unlike stocks (earnings+dividends) or FX (yield) - it has no carry and therefore no funda catalysts.
The longer is does NOT go up the more frustrated the buyers will be and steep sell off is likley

In France, no capital gain on crypto, income tax only because considered a product, not a security. Totally legal then & Neo I don't own is OK.
1847 2018-01-16 13:28:47 Have to say. This bitcoin tumble is classic. Now the public will start selling locking in losses from their December buys. Just perfect bubble experience. People should not be betting their money. Investing in stocks is the way to go.

1969 2018-01-16 12:24:59 Mostly Asia, that's where the most of the money comes from into crypto. Guys, it's no different than stocks or fiat, negative news always affects an industry. Until Asia gets a fixed position on crypto, things will continue to tank.

1974 2018-01-16 12:20:39 Electric fishing doesn't, of itself, need to be harmful. (It's regularly used to assess fish stocks and retuen healthy fish unharmed). The problem is that, under the guise of "Research", the EU has effectively licensed wholesale use of pulse without knowing the consequences.

2008 2018-01-16 12:05:43 Lots of stocks of companies provide capital gains either without paying dividends or paying miniscule amount. So they are not directly correlated especially in the Indian context. In the US, the dividend culture is far more prevalent

2037 2018-01-16 11:44:09 I think the urge to short this gap up in stocks needs to be avoided unless 1 thing happens.  Unless it gaps up 200 stays in a plus 200 area for hours and then runs up a few hundred more.  That would be my capitulation.  Otherwise, dont short the open.  Better opportunity coming.

2054 2018-01-16 11:27:44 Bull Market Script since 2013:
Low-Interest rates = Relative Valuations attractive
Buy Back stocks = Increases EPS at faster rate
Tax Cuts = More money to buy back shares
Economic Recovery means more revenue and profit
On top of that=Inflation remains low and interest rates too

2057 2018-01-16 11:26:44 Agri and Infra related stocks like Jain irrigation, RCF , Dilip Buildcon may gain some traction.
2058 2018-01-16 11:26:42 Not like hedging in the first place , when your stocks go right ,it's ok to not hedge but when you know that it can come down given the market conditions ,hedging could be considered as an option.
Squarring off the position could be another.
I can be wrong and I reserve the right
2059 2018-01-16 11:25:13 btw there are multiple cryptocurrencies and yes their prices fluctuate less like a normal currency and more like stocks because essentially they are stocks to a degree but year virtual money is just as prone to failure if systemic loss of data happens worldwide

2247 2018-01-16 09:01:30 from an investing POV lesson learnt from #CLLN - avoid low margin, low growth, indebted, cheap stocks. ONLY buy quality companies with strong fundamentals especially balance sheets - ones with a moat (high margins), a history of growth & good management!

2662 2018-01-16 04:11:06 Why do American regulators and tax law treat money and property differently?

Money *represents* property; money abstracts any concrete object of exchange. Cash/currency, chickens, cars, art, stocks, crypto tokens, etc. - each tradeable, each have a δprice/δtime.

Money=property.

2676 2018-01-16 04:02:11 There are a few bubbles that are going to burst. In the US it’s definitely the stock market that needs a realignment. In the U.K. it will be the property market first, due to unsustainable rises, then U.K. stocks. The when is when the markets stops falling for their own b/s.

2748 2018-01-16 03:02:35 Trading Rule #2
Keep calm! Dont chase a run, decide for yourself wether you like the trade or not. If you are not comfortable with the risks stay out. Approach methodically & always trade with a strategy in mind. #investing #trading #entrepreneur #stocks #crypto #savings #startup
2749 2018-01-16 03:02:00 learned cryptocurrency a little.....made an investment seen some growth...now it's time to get into stocks.....
2750 2018-01-16 03:01:14 I find that going with the 3x etf in the strongest trending sectors cuts down on all of the individual stocks mining and volatility as well as earnings watch time.
2751 2018-01-16 03:00:18 DR is basically buying laway (trust/goodwill) that the Bank/Agent which issued it has the actual corresponding stocks that represent the implied value of the DR. The DR is not the share/stock.
2752 2018-01-16 02:59:56 what exactly is this?? i love the questionnaire. if someone can't answers those they should stick to penny stocks
2753 2018-01-16 02:59:04 Stocks and Bitcoin seem inversely correlates ... what do you think?
2754 2018-01-16 02:57:12 So what stocks mean nothing to me only to the rich and of course they're the ones that benefit from it. Close the damn stock market
2755 2018-01-16 02:56:37 Or just go to Bevin’s house and not buy anything that he stocks his home with. I’m sure he gets all the Koch products.

2787 2018-01-16 02:33:54 Scott, I agree with you.  That such 2017 corn yields would occur in the U.S. seems "heroic", but those are the numbers we are operating on until some future set of Grain Stocks report results proves otherwise.

2805 2018-01-16 02:28:19 Yes, CBW owned 49% of the company...thats the beautiful thing with CBW stocks, they have I believe 17 of the the MJ mid cap to small cap companies in their debt from loans.
2806 2018-01-16 02:27:45 I agree but I think the interest in crypto is helped by very very overvalued traditional risky assets like US stocks and bonds right now. So there’s a “where to put money” question I hear a lot

2810 2018-01-16 02:26:24 central banks can buy sovereign and corporate bonds and stocks. Also can buy/sell interest rate swaps and extend swap lines to other central banks. I don't love cbanks but crypto has nothing comparable.

2815 2018-01-16 02:22:56 Comparing to previous bubbles, one perspective is important.  Global CBs pumped $25tn+ worth free money this time, unlike housing or dotcom time.  With so much free money around this time, crypto is hardly the only bubble out there. Check valns of Indian stocks, tencent, Alibaba.

2818 2018-01-16 02:21:53 We  celebrate the rise of the markets but fail to mourn the fall in economic health.

This is the reason I have started suggesting turnaround stocks where the fall, when it comes, will be limited.

Lets also wish that the economic trend reverses quickly.

2826 2018-01-16 02:19:14 ICOs are an important future for investment.

Not everyone can buy stocks in a new company they want a part of. 

Now, everyone can invest in ideas and companies through ICOs. In return you stock value (coins).

This gives equality to everyone.

This is the future

2833 2018-01-16 02:12:45 What?? Jobs are plentiful. Unemployment is all-time low. Stocks are all-time high. Minority business ownership is rising like never before. Tax reform has given businesses the opportunity to pay higher wages for employees of all races. Companies are moving back to the USA.
2834 2018-01-16 02:12:17 US stocks have gone up slightly less than those in other rich developed nations. It's a global boom, and very little to do with the Bozo in Chief -- which is exactly what he will say when the inevitable correction occurs.
2835 2018-01-16 02:11:39 This is pointless - Wall Street has NO bearing on Main Street. You wouldn’t know that because your daddy never taught you about Main Street. 90% of the middle class don’t own stocks, so this tweet of yours doesn’t mean shit!

2844 2018-01-16 02:07:15 Buying stocks with low public & high public SH can cut both ways. If we buy cheap, it becomes preciously scarce. If not, it is dumped on us.
2845 2018-01-16 02:07:03 It would be wrong of them to accuse us of cheating using an app that's really not there. If they do that we can always show that it's a joke an the app is not real an so they'll become the laughing stocks for simply believing the enemy lolol
2846 2018-01-16 02:06:41 By the way, here's a little something from an article from today:  "...there was nothing to recover from. Jobs, stocks and GDP are rising under Trump, just as they did under Obama. In fact, by almost every measure, the performance of the economy .../2

2865 2018-01-16 01:53:53 Your stocks went up over the past nine years. But much of the rise came from the market coming back from the housing crisis. It also took 10 trillion dollars to get those respectable gains. But the tremendous gains over the past year with Trump are beyond comparison.
2866 2018-01-16 01:53:32 Well, keeping our military from getting raises so the money can go to defense contracts probably pays pretty well, sooo... Then there’s the value of the ruble... then the Trump payouts... Exxon payments... Big Pharma stocks... or anything else the rest of us are screwed on.

2873 2018-01-16 01:49:02 Crypto needs to be regulated. Exchanges should block transactions when suspicous things are happening. This is organized and they generate tons of money. In "real"stocks, these guys would be arrested for things like that.
2874 2018-01-16 01:48:54 so happy my brother getting me in stocks & cryptocurrency , it's like a whole other world full of money 
2875 2018-01-16 01:48:54 ooo i only got a box that had 3 bags but next time i go to toronto.... stocks up on my favs
2876 2018-01-16 01:48:53 Great, but f you at fortunate to own stocks.
2877 2018-01-16 01:48:51 Very few lower and middle income Americans own stocks! Only the wealthy, like the Trumps.
2878 2018-01-16 01:48:50 Like I said, you sound like you merely repeat propaganda talking points. So you assume that the average American - because the majority of Americans benefit from stocks and hold them directly or indirectly, are "unethical?" Seems very jaded and cynical.
2879 2018-01-16 01:48:21 In traditional stocks, January is about taking profits (defers taxes til next year). Can def see with the swings in Marketcap people are taking FIAT. Those profits are then reinvested at the new support levels. #hodl #trx #tron $trx (Lots of Trx profits early this year to take)
2880 2018-01-16 01:48:12 I have people asking me to make a group/room so I’m making one tonight, like if you want in. I only buy stocks with catalysts mostly for long term and some short term, no P&D please.
2881 2018-01-16 01:47:47 You must not own any stocks! Too bad for you! Tax cuts! SCOTUS! He is doing great! Keep watching CNN!
2882 2018-01-16 01:47:43 I’m going to buy stocks in #smoothieking very soon cause i spend over 100 a week here. Fuck it. Better than eating animals right 
2883 2018-01-16 01:47:42 え、kmnさん...
2884 2018-01-16 01:47:35 Campaign Trump: NAFTA sucks getting rid of NAFTA.

Today Trump: NAFTA good for stocks we keep NAFTA.

Who didn't see that coming 
2885 2018-01-16 01:46:45 You have not removed a source of danger, that is the fact you seem incapable of accepting.  Bump stocks are not required to bump fire.
2886 2018-01-16 01:45:13 $GTG would have to be one of the most promising tech stocks on the asx when #bitcoin group director comes on board. $DCC $OOK $ZYB
2887 2018-01-16 01:43:51 What are the odds that Trump isn't finished taking money away from the lower middle class by forcing a shut down of the govt. and blame the Dems.  Stocks drop and investors sell to keep from losing too much money so specialist buy to stabilize the markets.
2888 2018-01-16 01:43:24 So dirty they shouldn't be allowed to buy, sell or trade stocks as our congressmen.  It's public service not a get rich scheme.  It's disgusting to look at the wealth accumulated by our meagerly paid elected ( don't even know what to call them lol)

TERM LIMITS  pretty please
2889 2018-01-16 01:43:21 People who own stocks
2890 2018-01-16 01:43:12 NG_F open lower. Take care with your natural gas stocks tomorro. #energy #nyse
2891 2018-01-16 01:42:34 Oh, and bump stocks are not only useless on an automatic, but actually may cause them not to function. You know nothing of how firearms function.
2892 2018-01-16 01:42:09 dakulaon si change sa ecp wtffff pinabakal ko na si stocks ko suugma

2894 2018-01-16 01:40:49 Obviously, dangers in the world remain even after you remove one source of danger. What is the value to society of bump stocks that is so important for you to protect?
2895 2018-01-16 01:39:36 Words are not effective in this situation, time to start putting in the stocks and a little castration and genital mutilation in public for this monster!!! Don't forget to YOU=TUBE IT!!!!
2896 2018-01-16 01:39:16 Night time feeding and all I can smell is the sweet scent of the beautiful stocks @cate_a_moore sent us to celebrate the arrival of our beautiful babies - thank you x
2897 2018-01-16 01:35:59 Any solid company? Define the term. While MJ companies are real, they are trading at levels that do not reflect current earnings. While not a bubble like tech stocks , their values are partly based on hope.
2898 2018-01-16 01:33:57 Market is very hot right now.  I'm waiting for a short term pull back (3, 5, 8 days) pullback in many stocks.  Once that happens I'll be fully invested.
2899 2018-01-16 01:33:49 First News 16 January 2018 - US stocks closed; Dow Futures rose triple digits, Chinese Iron Ore, Thailand, HK, PSEi +2.99% to 8857 (18.7x), SMPH, NEDA/SMC, AGI, MRC, Energy, Morgan Stanley: Asia Outlook, AP, MEG, PSE, SSS/PSE, Third Telco/TEL/GLO, BPI, ALHI, BSP/Banks, OFW
2900 2018-01-16 01:33:33 Yeah - always a trade off with price with delivery time. UK stocks seem to be 5 times the price!
2901 2018-01-16 01:33:20 Ck out my survey on social media stocks. I'll favorite it.
2902 2018-01-16 01:33:08 I'm sure you and your rich family are tickled 2 death with the permanent big tax breaks you got and the stock performance now. Eric, I'm retired, do not have stocks and just received notice  of a SS raise.The amount didn't change by one penny because my Medicare went up>My World
2903 2018-01-16 01:33:02 is there a website where i can find u/g and d/g on stocks?
2904 2018-01-16 01:32:48 A week in the stocks should remedy that.
2905 2018-01-16 01:32:07 Rappler: "they(omidyar) invest, but they don't own rappler". Explain daw. Coz if i buy stocks of a company, it means i own part of it right? No matter how small it is, im entitled to dividends, etc. Lemme get the popcorn and watch this shit hit the fan. #skwelalagi
2906 2018-01-16 01:31:31 Making the 1% mark even further from my grasp, but its ok all my stocks went up............

2908 2018-01-16 01:29:23 If this is because ARMYs are legit selling out renewed stocks, I'm gonna cry. If it's line, YO, we've been over this before. BTS merch sell out quick 
2909 2018-01-16 01:29:20 It's only 28mins and everything sold out seriously what is the point why are there so little stocks they should just let people preorder or something.
2910 2018-01-16 01:29:18 And yeah he's exceeding expectations because the market is overinflated right now, the FAANG stocks have a disproportionate pull on the Dow and consumer confidence doesn't match what the numbers actually say about our economy
2911 2018-01-16 01:28:45 What type of strategy are you using to evaluate stocks?
2912 2018-01-16 01:27:48 Cannot too wrong with blue chips. Coca Cola McDonald’s etc. As long as you are in for the long haul. If you want to gamble invest in Canadian marijuana stocks.
2913 2018-01-16 01:27:13 Let Ur women vent 2U about her day & U listen while she rides ur face. Then when she’s done U get up..cook her a 5 course meal & whisper in her ear “ I had Ur car detailed baby, I walked the dogs, I paid all the bills &  I bought U some stocks. 2018 &on is about spoiling Ur women
2914 2018-01-16 01:26:44 Exactly, these fans that just hate on Wenger constantly are the reason our fanbase are looked at as laughing stocks, no respect for the club or themselves, just to give Arsenal Fan TV soundbites and airtime

The Lord will provide
2917 2018-01-16 01:23:25 Yes...Bob the coal miner loves it when goldman Sachs and Apple stocks do well.
2918 2018-01-16 01:23:15 It is a parallel to "dynamite fishing" that they used to do in the Bayou a hundred years ago. Just another way to wipe out the fish stocks. Sigh.
2919 2018-01-16 01:23:15 That's my point...these jobs are gone. The govt tax cuts are making companies buy back stocks to lower payouts. Companies are bot investing in R&D or expansion. Like I said, fragile economy.
2920 2018-01-16 01:22:08 Are you serious, with this shit?? You need a hefty chunk of change to buy stocks; most of us normal people don't have that.
2921 2018-01-16 01:21:55 Because the money has flowed into pot stocks?

2923 2018-01-16 01:20:56 And they did. Stocks are up not because the rich have confidence in orange clown but because he is their preferred color and loves money more than his own country. Unlike you anti American repubes who tried to keep Obama down; If we help Dotard succeed, we all can succeed.
2924 2018-01-16 01:20:54 Hey moron jr, the only people that have stocks in this country are the wealthiest. The real middle clas is still waiting for a tax break. Tax reform was a scam on America republicans will regret in November 2018. The end of GOP. Thank your daddy!
2925 2018-01-16 01:20:51 Should I invest in stocks again?
2926 2018-01-16 01:19:53 Chinese developers fall in Hong Kong on sentiment China won’t ease property tightening measures and as investors took profit after the recent surge in stocks.
2927 2018-01-16 01:18:27 Go crypto fuck stocks rn
2928 2018-01-16 01:18:26 how are the wisynco stocks doing?
2929 2018-01-16 01:17:36 For the 80% of Americans who own little or no stocks this means nothing. Shows how out of touch you are.
2930 2018-01-16 01:17:14 Who stocks half-fat puff pastry?
2931 2018-01-16 01:17:03 48% of Americans can NOT afford to buy stocks.  That’s a problem.
2932 2018-01-16 01:16:57 There are most likely very limited stocks left since they can't even restock the actual stores. They underestimated the demand so much.
2933 2018-01-16 01:16:54 Don’t forget beer pong at Stocks on Tuesdays.
2934 2018-01-16 01:16:09 Again except for IB that is.I can trade Australia weedstocks on the ASX in AUD from California if I feel like it.Canadian stocks (+ options) in CAD when US closed is a non-issue.Shit if I wanna buy Canadian weedstocks via their German tickers I can do that too. Plus best borrows.
2935 2018-01-16 01:15:20 General consensus is that 83% of stocks are owned by the top 10%.
2936 2018-01-16 01:14:47 Sure, my stocks, health care and paying for son’s college is easier.  Yes I pay because we don’t get supplemented for our dreams.
2937 2018-01-16 01:14:21 Wait four months when stocks start going down.... more layoffs as well as the little tiny tax cuts won’t but shiteconomy will be the issue

2940 2018-01-16 01:12:54 You can extrapolate given the number of Pintos on the road, the frequency and type of accidents, the number of people involved, ...
You are not removing a source of danger as the stocks are not necessary to bump fire.
2941 2018-01-16 01:12:38 I don't think you fully grasp the whole point of stocks.
2942 2018-01-16 01:12:24 Yep stocks move slow haha
2943 2018-01-16 01:12:15 ...black man, and be done with it. But, what you are saying is virtually impossible. If a companies stocks went down 50% do you what that means???
2944 2018-01-16 01:12:06 Less than half of the US invest. Most of those are probably your disgustingly wealthy friends and business cronies. Just shut up about stocks. Funny how you can retweet so quickly about this garbage but couldn't be bothered when Hawaii thought it was about to be bombed. #Sad
2945 2018-01-16 01:12:05 BaaS is the most 2018 thing I have ever heard of. 

Been nervous about individual chinese stocks so i have always just owned $KWEB etf. 

Gonna be in there buying $BIDU calls for friday tho. 

BaaS baby BaaS.
2946 2018-01-16 01:12:03 Don't.  And be sure to short sell all your stocks and assets.
2947 2018-01-16 01:11:33 Must be nice to own the stocks and have daddy in charge of laws that affect them. Go you!!
2948 2018-01-16 01:11:04 a bitch rlly out here buying stocks who am I
2949 2018-01-16 01:10:53 Typical. Can only buy Canadian stocks that are also traded in OTC, but that was also closed today so my stocks were changing price & I couldn't even track it, let alone trade
2950 2018-01-16 01:10:35 God grant me patience to put up with idiots. You are either lying that these stocks devalued 40-50       % throughout Obama’s 8 years, which would mean the companies would NOT have issued dividends, or you are lying now. Jesus. Why do you all do this? Just admit you hated the....
2951 2018-01-16 01:10:26 The rich buying up stocks with their wind fall from the US tax payers.... All poor and mindless class.
2952 2018-01-16 01:10:17 This kid on Kid’s Baking Championship just said he wants to win the $25k prize so he can ‘buy stocks and a go cart.’ That’s serious diversification. Think he offers financial advising services?
2953 2018-01-16 01:10:15 Mixed bag in the land of Oz as #cannabis stocks are +/- 5%; which is pretty tame, all things considered.

The US/CAD complex saw a *substantial* number of capital raises these last few weeks and gobbled them up.  Impressive

Cannabis bulls don't wanna see a US govt shutdown.
2954 2018-01-16 01:10:14 I wonder how many stocks do they have actually why do i think they have only 10 slots for each character/item lmao
2955 2018-01-16 01:09:29 Wow tout est partie en 1h même pas ! Et encore, il y avait pas beaucoup de choix... J'espère qu'ils vont refaire rapidement les stocks sur Amazon  #BT21
2956 2018-01-16 01:09:13 I don't think you understand the purpose of stocks..
2957 2018-01-16 01:09:04 WTF i just opened the bt21 site less than half an hour ago and there's still many stocks AND NOW IT'S SOLD OUT SRSLY
2958 2018-01-16 01:08:41 I'm a Trump supporter and I don't hold any stocks. Yet I think its incredibly relevant.
2959 2018-01-16 01:08:25 Even after getting huge tax cuts, many companies are laying off. Looks like we are in a recession. Better start regulating buying stocks on credit.   2008
2960 2018-01-16 01:07:19 That's great for the people that have stocks!Not so great for the rest of us huh...
2961 2018-01-16 01:04:40 Yeah cuz crypto-bitcoin is the biggest bubble that has ever existed. What we need to buy is more tech company stocks or tulips
2962 2018-01-16 01:04:38 Me: *sees UT canceled classes* 

Me: *goes to the store and stocks up on Takis*
2963 2018-01-16 01:04:27 Yes. I have found many stocks that beat the indexes. But, I love the ETF's. I just have to be careful with the triples. But I think they're great. $LABU is much better for me than individual biotech.
2964 2018-01-16 01:02:19 It does if they own stocks on the companies they work for
2965 2018-01-16 01:02:01 Hopefully Klopp has realised this and makes the change, looks like he has just realised how big of an issue the keeping stocks actually are
2966 2018-01-16 01:01:49 Trump is sad! He’s like a 5 year old calling other kids names!! But NO!! He’s OUR President! Thanks Trump! We are the laughing stocks of the WORLD! #Trump
2967 2018-01-16 01:01:18 What percentage of poor people have stocks? What percentage of middle-income have stocks? Now here's an easy one for you what percentage of the rich have stock? The last one I believe it's around 95%
2968 2018-01-16 00:59:25 Recovery after Bush tanked it is a lot harder that jumping on a good economy and promising rich ppl they are going to get more money. Of course stocks went up. But who does that really help. The richest 10% own 97% of the shares. Also as trump once said sm not good Econ indicator
2969 2018-01-16 00:59:23 The way 10700 & 10600 pe were sold unless we have a gap down of 1% we might not see them this series. Or the heavy weight stocks have to post poor results
2970 2018-01-16 00:58:25 Everybody invests in stocks in one form or another. From retirement accounts to savings accounts to municipal bonds.

When the tide rises all ships rise.
2971 2018-01-16 00:57:47 Wish I could afford stocks.
2972 2018-01-16 00:57:11 Are you stupid or just dumb?  The #DJIA is made up of about 30 stocks.  So it only effects the value of those stocks.  Not everybody is invested in those stocks or the market @ all!  So stop bragging!
2973 2018-01-16 00:57:11 dOnald tRump. Have you seen the price of Gas since you Became President????
The Damn Stocks Ain't doing Nothing for the Average Man/Woman...
2974 2018-01-16 00:56:59 So are we banning bump stocks or...?
2975 2018-01-16 00:56:12 Facts factoid And where that does beg the orphan stocks are like?
2976 2018-01-16 00:55:32 Australia New Motor Vehicle Sales YoY DEC Surge to 6.7% vs 2.1% Previous as Auto Demand Rises. #Australia #Asia #Auto #Asia #ASEAN #Sydney #Stocks #Bonds #CARZ #ETFs #Cars #Trucks #TuesdayThoughts
2977 2018-01-16 00:55:31 I hope the 13 million Americans that have lost/will lose their health insurance due to the Republican party's #TaxScamBill have invested a lot of their non-existing money in stocks.
2978 2018-01-16 00:55:25 I have booming 401k after 8 failed years and stocks that are doing phenomenal! Anyone can purchase stocks ya know
2979 2018-01-16 00:54:40 Stocks and economy do not belong together in the same sentence.

Your supporters may soon start thinking on their own & realize you aren't an Emperor or Wizard. 

No thanks #DelusionalMan
2980 2018-01-16 00:54:18 Don't  you realize that 80% of stocks, are owned by the top 10%

So thank you for pointing out what you're not doing for mainstream America
2981 2018-01-16 00:54:09 @realDonaldTrump You do know that NONE of your base own any stock shares! Only the rich own stocks and they are less than 1% of your base! Your base doesn't care about the stock market! IDIOTS!
2982 2018-01-16 00:53:36 For all the people that have stocks, how nice for you!  How the rest of us who don’t care because we don’t have any?  Put your #SilverSpoon back in your mouth...
2983 2018-01-16 00:53:04 Wow had no clue you are so popular picking stocks. Now I feel better about my $trx bag.
2984 2018-01-16 00:52:59 How many average Americans actually own stocks outside of maybe underfunded 401k plan?
2985 2018-01-16 00:52:55 That means that she a handful of stocks are doing well. More than a few are oil/petroleum based. They will do@well when the government is bendin over backward to give them carte blanche over all of us who have to share the globe.
2986 2018-01-16 00:51:43 ERIC... do you realize that 80% of stocks, are owned by the top 10%

So thank you for pointing out what your worthless father isn't doing for mainstream America
2987 2018-01-16 00:51:16 Oh, I'm sure all those thousands of folks who lost jobs in the last month are gonna be overjoyed and rush out to buy damn stocks from their unemployment checks...IF they even get unemployment. Such an ass
2988 2018-01-16 00:51:05 I don't own any stocks so...
Make America great again- put the trumps in prison
Put pence in prison
Remove all complicit GOP
2989 2018-01-16 00:50:49 You Make America Racist Again- stocks can’t buy decency and dignity.
2990 2018-01-16 00:50:36 The majority of Americans don't have stocks and this doesn't help them at all. Also, you're riding Obama's upward trend so this has little to do with Trump. If you really want to make America great again, you'll convince your father to resign.
2991 2018-01-16 00:50:24 You know, no matter what Wall Street does it does not effect the deficit .  It only helps those like you and your father who are part of the 1%   Middle class cannot usually afford to invest in Stocks.
2992 2018-01-16 00:50:10 Value of ALL stocks?

Who gives a shit?
2993 2018-01-16 00:49:08 It's Already happening. Republicans have tried this Trickle Down shit B4. All that happens; Unemployment rate goes High. CEO take big Raises, Corp. DONT RE-invest. Stocks take Hit - And Dem (Oprah) Has to do a Obama - Fix Republic Fu.k ups. DT About Himself,Don't give F ab thePPL

2997 2018-01-16 00:45:24 Coins aren't stocks or bonds. If words are the same, it means they aren't doing what they aimed to do because they are just like the current financial system and, also, SEC should be involved because they are securities.
2998 2018-01-16 00:43:51 From CNN Skeptics fear end will be painful, cuz stocks have been pumped up to enormous heights by stimulus frm Fed Res. Julian Robertson, billionaire investor, warned that Fed is "creating a bubble" in stocks by being slow to raise interest rates frm levels leftover frm 2008.

3000 2018-01-16 00:43:00 @jimcramer Random question I can't find the answer to...at what point can  stocks only trading at limit orders move away from that? There are lots over $10 a share still doing it. Also, why would stocks ONLY have a limit order option? #stocks
3001 2018-01-16 00:42:10 Love seeing different strategies on the Twitter traders take when deciding on executing trades.. Some are yes scary and some show pure genius. #Stocks

You’re right there is a wall and it didn’t work before, what makes you think it’ll work now. Stocks have been going up for almost six years. Not Trump

3014 2018-01-16 00:29:36 We could bring back stocks, where creepy delivery guys could have half eaten kebabs flung at them?

3023 2018-01-16 00:22:26 Excellent. Loved it. I'm an IBD guy and your entry points are more. Aggressive. But I'm a believer that price and volume are your best technical tools. I'd enjoy learning more. Does the maxlist ever change? Could you explain y these stocks are favored?
3024 2018-01-16 00:22:25 Sell the property, buy something cheaper, invest the $200,000 on dividends stocks...the money saved on mortgage add it to 401K and the stocks portfolio.

3030 2018-01-16 00:19:34 Yes, being in the US and having a few Canadian stocks I'd like to be able to still trade when Canadian markers open. Would I need to open a Canadian account?
3031 2018-01-16 00:19:26 Stocks matter to anyone that gets a retirement check, a paycheck, or likes the capitalist way of life. What's good for big business is good for everyone.
3032 2018-01-16 00:16:00 No worries Rob just get interactive brokers and convert some CAD then you won't be forced to watch...shit I can even trade Australian weed stocks on the ASX.

3035 2018-01-16 00:12:40 that graph has nothing to do with what we are discussing.  it is true rich have more money to invest in stocks and the market has been on fire.  buying power is more an inflationary issue
3036 2018-01-16 00:12:25 Out State of the Union is great! Thanks to Pres Trump and no thanks to the demoturds so let em boycott, snub, whatever they want 2 label it. They had NOTHING 2 do with:

Unemployment down
Stocks up
Companies building
Jobs coming back
Energy independence
Etc etc etc

3044 2018-01-16 00:03:24 Agree.  If stocks hold up Fed is going to raise.
3045 2018-01-16 00:02:06 Trading stocks is definitely the biggest challenge of my life so far. If you can become consistently profitable then you can do ANYTHING.

3048 2018-01-16 00:00:10 What they may not understand is the difference between scale of corporate profits and modest bonuses. And because such a small proportion own stocks, they will not benefit. Junior's comments only obfuscate true situation.
3049 2018-01-16 00:00:03 As the individuals supported on it will be allowed to freely cross with either one or more wild stocks, 18.
3050 2018-01-16 00:00:00 Yes, those are THEIR numbers. I'm just asking for OUR numbers. Any smart investor would require a detailed plan before handing their money over. Do you base buying things (car, stocks, etc.) solely on how it worked out for your neighbor?
