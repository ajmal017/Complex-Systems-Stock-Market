5 2018-11-27 23:46:49 People need to understand that the bitcoin production cost is not a bottom for at least a couple reasons. 

(1) Commodities are routinely mined below production cost. (2) The cost of bitcoin production changes as miners drop out or add capacity. It’s dynamic.

62 2018-11-27 20:32:16 But that price discovery mechanism across different time frames is much more intricate than "price follows hash" and IMO is better comm'd as "the sole producers of provably scarce, highly sought after commodities will always demand the highest price the market is willing to pay."
63 2018-11-27 20:25:27 The last & least important thing in branding must be the logo. Rebranding requires a culture reset that addresses every business process in the organization.

64 2018-11-27 20:24:16 I feel much empathy for them, as a victim myself from another large corporation 5 yrs ago.  Employees are viewed as disposable commodities, shareholders are not.  Eventually, this line of thinking will ruin companies.

66 2018-11-27 20:00:06 i think we think about stories, television and movies as commodities. so much marketing is directed at making entertainment properties extensions of ourselves. geek is an identity. star wars isn't a movie, it's your childhood. people feel ownership over stories they didn't write.

90 2018-11-27 18:30:11 But Goldman says 2019 will be great for commodities!
91 2018-11-27 18:29:43 yeah, and ag trade is shifting, too. Oil has crashed. So much going on in commodities.
92 2018-11-27 18:28:17 Good point. Sadly, unscrupulous dog breeders who make their money from exploiting animals,  use these Shelters as waste disposal centres for their spent commodities, as they know full well that compassionate folk like us will take them home. The cycle continues.

94 2018-11-27 18:22:17 What is the Fed/Treasury collusive game plan in raising rates?
We know that higher rates are destroying growth.
We know the Fed/Treasury know high rates will destroy the currency.
So you crush economy with higher rates & slaughter commodities w HFT then implement ZIRP @LukeGromen
95 2018-11-27 18:21:58 What would be the catalyst for higher highs in say the 10 year yield? Growth peaked, inflation peaked in August, Oil crashing, many core commodities crashing. I don't see it. Wage growth up but has no historical correlation to higher yields.
96 2018-11-27 18:20:49 Commodities are volatile! 

Thanks @Mining. Thanks @Reuters. 
"Iron ore futures in China fell more than 5 percent on Tuesday to their lowest in four-and-a-half months, extending losses into a third session on expectations that slower demand will keep steel prices under pressure."
97 2018-11-27 18:16:52 Once oil has put in the initial (and perhaps final local low) the 'inflation' from the bounce and perhaps a new leg up will ignite a move not away from commodities but into them... even the countercyclical PMs... which would lead ideally not follow.  I am oddly hankering for DBC
98 2018-11-27 18:16:21 E a crise de 2008 não afetou somente o Brasil, afetou os EUA, a UE e todos os países exportadores de commodities, nos quais se inclui o Brasil
99 2018-11-27 18:15:06 This is what happens when education is seen as being only a commodity. Soon, all the people within it are merely commodities also.
100 2018-11-27 18:10:30 It’s wild the way the banks destroyed bitcoin that fast. Commodities about to do numbers just FYI. That’s how you know the economy is slowing down. Be safe tho

108 2018-11-27 17:38:18 Could you call assets like Stellar Lumens (XLM) and XRP digital "financial commodities"? How do their protocol's stand to balance the interests of investors (appreciation) and users (stability)? #Coindesklive
109 2018-11-27 17:35:30 Hard to do when no one wants your products and the company is getting hammered by the commodities tarrifs.

111 2018-11-27 17:18:01 It’s true (and amazon’s robotics is narrow in scope), though I don’t think though smaller companies are going to be successful at turning robotics experience into proper scalable, affordable cloud services to commodities robotics (though @C2RO_Robotics is giving it a go).
112 2018-11-27 17:17:58 USD, yeah, much more of a chaos hedge than other cash. Commodities are priced in dollars (for now) so every government, institution, and major commodity consuming corporation is forced to hold USD for trade.
113 2018-11-27 17:17:25 The bigger message here is "things are complicated and do not fit into a tweet."  Some tokens may be securities, others may be commodities.  You will have to learn to work with the CFTC, IRS, SEC, FinCEN, etc. etc. etc.
114 2018-11-27 17:11:28 The artworks themselves are commodities sadly but the public gallery doesn't function as a market
115 2018-11-27 17:05:33 Daniel, going way back to my Brazilian roots, the government always had some kind of currency target. Brazil been a net exporter of mainly commodities and importer of everything else, currency stability was crucial. I’d believe China would be the same in a different scale.
116 2018-11-27 17:01:01 Goldman's calls are usually the kiss of death. Careful. Long gold, but commodities could crash in an economic meltdown.
117 2018-11-27 16:57:53 AUD/USD - As i mention before, this one always do the fake rally in Asia and European session even if commodities crash and then when Us opens all buyers are burnt and today is the exactly the same

119 2018-11-27 16:57:06 The truth is that most of those items are being shift to Lagos from the south south in large quantities thereby making those commodities cheaper here in Lagos..  I was surprised when I noticed that crayfish is cheaper in Lagos compared to what is obtainable in calabar

137 2018-11-27 16:00:00 The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities,”1 its unit being a single commodity.

147 2018-11-27 15:28:27 if men aren't the problem and the system (that treats men as expendable commodities valued only for what they produce) is the problem-  then why do you think we should see a shrink? I get it- it's what you do. The system attacks masculinity- the system is the problem.

158 2018-11-27 15:03:29 It's from an equities and bonds trader mindset and not a commodities trader one.

Most companies whose stock or bonds drop 90% soon go bankrupt.

Most currencies that do against another one they trade freely with go to zero too.

Fixed issuance is the Killer Feature difference.

167 2018-11-27 14:52:30 Great thread. 

Electricity, just like most other things in Nigeria is stagnated because people who typically do not generate, and also make anti-generation laws/ policies, are the ones who want to control, distribute and take the lion share of commodities generated elsewhere

170 2018-11-27 14:48:06 Meaning other than technical trading and speculation what are the drivers? Gold for example has been used as a hedge for inflation, so when inflation goes up people invest in gold to protect purchasing power, stocks are driven by earnings, oil and commodities have real use...
171 2018-11-27 14:45:57 Are they also going to use the 589 commodities rule too that OZ Crypto was talking about in his latest vid, could be where th 589 number came from, telling us to compare crypto with what happened with gold

The thing that is inflating are wages...  so, what is the Fed fighting?
178 2018-11-27 14:31:50 The largest pay out so far was 7200. The money goes to the banks due to farmers running lines of credit. Then, when the land values drop and commodities plummet, the banks recall the loans or extend them at higher interest rates. I have no sympathy and I farm.

237 2018-11-27 10:58:18 Surely it’s almost time to sell us$ buy commodities. ??
238 2018-11-27 10:54:29 What? When did he say that commodities all have same supply? Yes, you can create more coffee, thus reducing price. Obviously. 
He said the supply defines the value. Which is also obvious. But what will someone who puts XRP on their name know?
239 2018-11-27 10:52:10 Crude is not 'commodities'. $GCC
240 2018-11-27 10:50:39 The #BlueEconomyConference is just a chance to enrich the rich and a chance to swindle money from the public coffers. If we can't sustain basic agriculture commodities like maize, how will the incompetent and corrupt system implement the blue economy
241 2018-11-27 10:50:38 Tax incentives in the health sector extend to #medicines diagnostics, public health chemicals, mosquito nets, inputs for manufacture of medical related commodities, packaging materials, machinery, industrial spare parts, refrigerated trucks, etc. @URAuganda #ChaseMalaria
242 2018-11-27 10:44:00 Yesterday, #gold traded 0.20% lower in the NY session and ended at USD 1228.80 per ounce. In the Asian session, at GMT 06:00, the precious metal is trading at USD 1228.40 per ounce, marginally lower from the NY close.

247 2018-11-27 10:17:34 @dlacalle_IA 

So far, all I read from brokers as 2019 Outlook is the same I read last year as 2018 Outlook:

- Dollar weakness
- EM strength
- Prefer EU to US
- Commodities rise

Seems brokers still live the QE mirage
248 2018-11-27 10:17:03 “Given the size of dislocations in #commodity pricing relative to fundamentals — with oil now having joined metals in pricing below cost support — we believe commodities offer an extremely attractive entry point for longs in oil, gold and base” Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs
249 2018-11-27 10:16:28 Call me a Muppet, but I prefer them talking Commodities (and their book?) up than down.

251 2018-11-27 09:44:16 That equal focus should be put on developing formal platforms/markets with requisite infrastructure for unbridled price setting/discovery of local commodities (platform where supply and demand will determine price as opposed to price being set arbitrarily by traders/retailers)
252 2018-11-27 09:42:05 No perchè commodities sono scese più del dollaro e perchè Italia non ha svalutato rispetto a Germania, Francia, Gran bretagna ecc. Insomma stai involontariamente elogiando l'euro #sdeng
253 2018-11-27 09:39:39 In South Sudan women and girls are being auctioned off like commodities and when asked about it they say it is in the name of poverty,they need to for provide for their families #ZindukaFest2018 #16DaysOfActivism
254 2018-11-27 09:30:29 I am in a new part of the US for me but I noticed this week Buffett’s @BNSFRailway seems to have more clean new freight cars around than I ever recall seeing together on other tracks before: is this perhaps related to any recent low iron/steel prices and/or new commodities?
255 2018-11-27 09:28:42 Price fluctuation happens with all kinds of commodities. We see that in gold and silver, the dollar is not backed by gold. When a single bitcoin is worth $10,000 USDA, it can be used in commodity trades for big business. A price fluctuation will limit it applications.
256 2018-11-27 09:26:20 Commodities: Gold slipped 0.07pc to $1,222 while Brent added 3.15pc at $60.64

259 2018-11-27 09:22:30 USA S&P500 may see a sharp drop from 2850/2900 levels ( by end Dec ) ,the down slide may be starting early 2019 toward 2100/2000 levels over 2019 and range there, recovery may be early 2020 .
Do not see how commodities can do too well  during this period.
260 2018-11-27 09:20:48 There seems to be one child and one woman on every boat or in every group of migrants. Now that is how these people landing treat their women and children...commodities.
261 2018-11-27 09:15:52 Did a bit of looking around junior ASX plays today, so many fantastic resources, yet tiny MC’s... commodities are still unloved, but that tide will turn. People are still slowly getting off the old property horse... should see funds trickle into commodities 2019+ IMO

264 2018-11-27 08:41:47 I just have a feeling water transport had not been given the attention it deserves. Now the waters are attracting attention for themselves with catastrophic consequences. Just like computers and medicines, life jackets are essential commodities that deserve to be tax free.
265 2018-11-27 08:29:13 Trying not to focus on my follower count because Twitter makes it WAY TOO EASY to view people as commodities for attention.

But I'll still think it's cool if I hit 5k.
266 2018-11-27 08:22:15 How can human beings be "imported"....are they goods? Commodities? The black kids you speak of Helen?
And to call this man a racist means you have noooo clue what racism really is.
267 2018-11-27 08:21:22 FED will keep raising rates and Trump will keep playing his silly games on trade. Also commodities going down are not good for oil companies it can create credit problems.
268 2018-11-27 08:21:10 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
269 2018-11-27 08:19:22 No hiking tariffs is a bad thing. It would hit China's economy. They are the biggest consumers of commodities, so it could mean commodity prices go lower.

279 2018-11-27 07:00:15 We slept under the stars last night away from the cities, away from Wi-Fi and modern commodities in the middle of nowhere and it was so authentic, perfect day 
280 2018-11-27 06:38:47 I'll be looking forward to the comments from the media when bitcoin becomes the benchmark for commodities trading around the world. ASIC's are getting cheaper and more efficient every year. Price will stablize when the satoshi value system gets adopted. Metric system of finance.
281 2018-11-27 06:35:23 I think we're talking about two different types of efficiency here. EV cars are mechanically simpler, which is one sort of (potential) cost advantage. Also means that powertrains may become more commodities, => cheaper.
282 2018-11-27 06:22:49 Indian Govt n Indian Politics is now managed by Gujarati Community(Ambani,Adani,Modi) who are known to be very shrewd businessmen.

- All surplus economies are located on EuroAsia.
- EuroAsian energy and commodities needs are covered internally.
- The US, UK and Japan are Iceland powers. UK, Japan gates to Euroasia.
- Roadblocks #AFG, #UA, #SYR, #IQ, #IR preventing EA integration
285 2018-11-27 06:08:58 You can’t see the video?  Enron got the govt to deregulate commodities and speculators drove prices up artificially to almost $150/barrel for oil until the bubble burst and it went to $60. Supply and demand had nothing to do with it. Just making extra profit because greed.
286 2018-11-27 06:08:49 Lool says the woman who sold weapons to ISIS destabilizing a whole country. You begged the US to go to war in Libya which is now a safe haven for terrorists and blacks are being sold like commodities in slave markets. You have zero moral ground terrorista
287 2018-11-27 06:06:14 Foda-se ideologia. A gente quer dinheiroooo!!! Quando formos menos dependentes de COMMODITIES aí vocês inventam as baboseiras do mundo das idéias de vocês
288 2018-11-27 05:57:39 important to note that us intervention prior to pinochet’s coup already had chile’s economy (specifically commodities) all out of whack and the cia at the very least condoned the coup. this kinda stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum
289 2018-11-27 05:51:58 So world oversupply of commodities causes crises? Isn't it time to abandon the theory that markets allocate resources efficiently? If food and oil and mineral overextraction causes panics, aren't prices arbitrary? Thus inflation too is psychological and easily fixed by indexation
290 2018-11-27 05:50:18 Depends on the ‘medical reasons’ and the harm inflicted.
If it is just prior to administering it to people, and it’s a lifesaving medicine, then it is acceptable.
If it’s bullshit cosmetics injected into their eyes, then NO.
We treat animals too easily as disposable commodities.
291 2018-11-27 05:49:24 Black FRIDAY again, all these feminist witches painting their faces and disrupting the wonderfully cultural acquisition of commodities. ENOUGH. NO BLACK FRIDAYS.
292 2018-11-27 05:42:11 Being a “legitimate” asset has no bearing on it being in a bear market. Legitimate assets (stocks, commodities, bonds, etc) have undergone many bear markets throughout history. For example, crude oil is a legitimate market, but it doesn’t negate the current bear market.
293 2018-11-27 05:37:40 P&G’s CEO, A. G. Laley, said that “#innovation is a prerequisite for sustained growth. No other path to proitable growth can be sustained over time. Without continual innovation, markets stagnate, products become commodities, and margins shrink.”

305 2018-11-27 04:02:54 I'm tired of seeing decent players get lost in development hell. When I'm elected president of USsoccer I'm going to have sitdowns with players and tell them to go anywhere but EPL, and anywhere but a big club elsewhere.  Do US players not realize they're cheap commodities?
306 2018-11-27 03:55:59 Yep but WWE logic is that should be rewarded. Hurting one of the hottest commodities should be rewarded and not punished it pisses me off just thanking about it
307 2018-11-27 03:17:07 You are incorrect, they have zero control on prices that they pay for commodities.  Volatility in these prices has HUGE affect on them and all other companies.
308 2018-11-27 03:16:37 A lot of people are viewed as commodities, especially athletes. There’s usually someone younger, hotter on the radar. Once someone can accept that’s sadly the reality, it makes it easier to understand/ accept

310 2018-11-27 02:59:41 Commodities is what you mean here. Treated as commodities.
311 2018-11-27 02:55:18 That’s not correct. This isn’t the stock market. These are commodities or currencies. They represent a shift of replacing the Fiat in the world into the Digital Assets. As crypto prices drop, it just means more is being converted to Fiat.
312 2018-11-27 02:52:56 Você é um paspalho mesmo, puxa saco de gringo! Vai apoiar o teu país, as empresas  daqui. Defenda nosso parque industrial, lute para defender os preços das nossas commodities, lute por ferrovias. Pare de achar que esses caras vão querer o melhor pro Brasil, porque não vão!
313 2018-11-27 02:51:41 It is A money but it is not Capital M “Money” at the moment. Someday all charts for goods and commodities will be in Sats. Until then, expect ups and downs.
314 2018-11-27 02:46:00 Ok. Mr tranquiliza. La caída de BMV en las últimas semanas no tiene que ver con AMLO. Es por COMMODITIES,  o como dicen en otro comentario, es culpa de EPN. Ok suena muy congruente. Saludos
315 2018-11-27 02:37:39 Based on the cycle,huge gains in commodities from 2002-2006 would correlate to 2022-2026?commodities have been severely depressed for a long time now plus historically never been this low compared to equities since the 70s
Do you see any beginning of a commodities bull run soon?
316 2018-11-27 02:21:38 Joder por el litio en si mismo es la verdadera miopía. El mundo se dirige hacia una sociedad del conocimiento y cada día valen menos estos commodities, de lo contrario por ej. Venezuela sería un éxito. Esto es persistir en el subdesarrollo (salitre, cobre, litio.. suma y sigue)
317 2018-11-27 02:16:55 Could be. Unfortunately could liquidate first along with other commodities. Has acted well lately which is reassuring.
318 2018-11-27 02:16:24 Depends upon the asset class. Deflation in bonds (higher rates). Deflation is stocks, actually a collapse. Reflation in stuff. Commodities. Gold. Bust will lead to realization that Central Banks are fucked. Weimar is the only way out. Asset holders will awaken to this fact.

324 2018-11-27 01:42:20 Laptop, full battery, red team book, and confidence. I can write script and trade commodities at the same time. I did that this morning. Ran Burpsuite and used another app to trade into some options I have been watching.
325 2018-11-27 01:42:09 I'll bet all in: Commodities are next cycle. I think metals actually might do really good.
326 2018-11-27 01:41:13 right,,,

& we usually call it 'inflation' or 'deflation'?
& for 'price' fall of a 'measure' to be real,
shouldn't it occur simultaneously across
diverse classes of assets/commodities &
over significantly large geographical area?

& pray plz show the data for thousands of yrs ?

334 2018-11-27 00:59:02 Dollar strength also continuing to weigh on the commodities complex
335 2018-11-27 00:52:13 Me rompe las pelotas que el dolar sea noticia para los periodistas solamente cuando sube. Cuando baja y perjudica a exportadores y gente que vive de commodities, no importa. Periodismo pedorro
336 2018-11-27 00:50:57 If you think there is a difference you are kidding yourself.  It's a business,  it's a job,  they are commodities just like you & me in our jobs.  That's why it's ridiculous to expect them to act differently than you or I would.  That's letting fandom get in the way of reality.
337 2018-11-27 00:49:07 Commodities prices as of now: 

Spot Gold: 1,229.30

USDPHP: 52.48
338 2018-11-27 00:36:10 I'd quite like to judge people on who they are, not just what they can bring. I think this is a classic example of the disconnect as our political class see people as purely commodities. This is partly why we're where we are as a society.
339 2018-11-27 00:32:51 Their (auto industry) business model is so complex they rely heavily on futures contracts to mitigate the volatility of commodities prices. Just because you assert that three other companies are doing fine doesn’t affirm what you’re saying
340 2018-11-27 00:26:01 En efecto, está en fase bajista el mercado de valores y el de commodities, se prevé un baja en el ritmo de la economía mundial. Existen buenas oportunidades de inversión, sólo hay que cruzarlo con un buen análisis fundamental y técnico
341 2018-11-27 00:09:02 I'm thinking that what is being said here might be reducible to "the service of being housed is a category of commodities" or something.  But if that is the case, then I'm not sure there's any sense made here in distinguishing it from commodities in general.
