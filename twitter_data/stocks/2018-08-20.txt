 I barely listen to him anymore thanks to the 3:00 start and then just the 8 minute opening. 
He’s charging a subscription? LOL, fuck him!!
That’s straight from his buddy, Cramer. He’s been touting stocks that have gone the subscription model on their businesses.
4 2018-08-20 23:55:28 Well the real problem is not about sustaining, even. It's about increasing profits. If they just strived to strike an even line we'd be better off but they want stocks going up up up up up infinitely.

They're scrambling to the roof now that they've gone through the ceiling.
5 2018-08-20 23:49:36 Ha! No got them from Toyota as a set. Michelins and aluminum rims. Then I have my stocks around here too!! 
6 2018-08-20 23:49:11 you can at the very least join as a character and SD your stocks immediately. I was wondering if you had to select a character in the CSS though.
7 2018-08-20 23:49:10 i think the hissyfit investors had over American Airlines in late April is the most simple and damning condemnation of the stock market

if wages go up, stocks go down. better stocks don't help workers. that's really all there is to say

If I wanted to neutralize this China risk, it’s probably easier to just sell these Chinese stocks and remove them from my universe. Not sure I want to do this when so oversold.

47 2018-08-20 23:22:13 Same as with Apple, people behave more like trend followers than contrarians, thereby shifting prices higher, whereas stocks on the lower side keep getting punished. Hard to predict, when this rally ends.
48 2018-08-20 23:22:09 Today is probably the last time to get in this cheap guys. As soon as stocks.exchabfe lists, it's off to the races.

56 2018-08-20 23:10:34 I hate checking my 401k, I always feel like I gotta move stocks around if one isn’t doing super great when in reality I have no idea what I’m doing
57 2018-08-20 23:10:27 @ArcticStarExpl Dear ladies and gentlemen, has somebody of the management sold stocks on August 20th, 2018 and / or last week, if yes, how much members of the mangement have sold stocks of Arctic Star and how much stocks has / have the members sold and which day?
58 2018-08-20 23:09:35 It sure is! I’ve had my 401k setup for about 3 years. H-E-B also has stocks that we’re vested in aside from retirement 
59 2018-08-20 23:08:58 glad im making shit with no stocks more often:)
60 2018-08-20 23:06:34 It's called getting a career with skills that people hold value in. Flipping a burger is something 99% of the people in this country can do. So the value is minimal. Neurology OTOH starts at $150k because not everyone can do it...
61 2018-08-20 23:06:32 I like to scan for stocks after the market closes or early morning. I make it a point not to look at twitter till after I made selections not to be influnced by others.

68 2018-08-20 23:02:51 Actually, what I find really interesting is how MSM has changed over time. During the 1990s, CNBC was famous for being rah-rah over tech stocks. Back then, good news got all the airtime. Today, the opposite is true. Everyone wants to know why the world will end
69 2018-08-20 23:02:38 Dang I'm into stocks now

73 2018-08-20 23:01:59 So what, betting a stock will drop deserve a cookie? Stocks being shorted indirectly incentizing the damaging of a company via the press so some Hedge fund dbag can place a prop bet

Short sellers are parasites, and the market would clear more efficiently if the SEC them as such

2) What's your deductible?
3) How much are your co-pays?
4) Have you ever delayed treatment because of cost? 
5) Have you ever had a hospital bill go to collections?
6) Do you own health care stocks?
Thanks!

92 2018-08-20 22:48:36 1) GDP is a barometer for the 10% who own 80% of all stocks...do you even do math? 
2) P/T, Min. Wage, Contract
3) being wrong on first two makes you an idiot. Also- you are NOT normal.

96 2018-08-20 22:43:14 What else do they give their investors in exchange their investment? Cookies? I can buy and sell Woolworths stocks just as easily.

98 2018-08-20 22:41:17 Massive Volume on these sharp moves higher in the Canadian LP's.  That usually bodes well for expected higher prices.  But these stocks have wild moves in both directions.

106 2018-08-20 22:33:41 ~14%/year vs 7-9% for the S&P...would win handily even accounting for fees. More personally, as someone who only uses a brokerage account with individual stocks, the active, but not; passive but not piece is really interesting.

113 2018-08-20 22:28:53 IMO, setting up for a Huge Breakout. Strong Volume. Retail Strong. Followed by Blue Sky Territory after that. VOLUME PRECEDES PRICE. I think that $ROKU gets taken out with a very nice premium. $$$$$$

119 2018-08-20 22:25:44 This is why I don't out my money in deposit accounts with these banks but put them in their stocks. I just love them.

121 2018-08-20 22:24:40 they're full of wishful thinking, what about if someone just picks 3 top tiers, then theres stocks, would just be one stock matches. win the first one switch characters.
122 2018-08-20 22:24:04 This is Great. Where's your report on the $289M #MonsantoTrial verdict and subsequent $11B tanking of #Bayer stocks 3 days later? @OrganicConsumer @maddow @GMOFreeUSA @yesmaam74 @urth2kenzie @drvandanashiva

125 2018-08-20 22:23:28 I don’t understand the benefits of these rumor articles. When they are wrong (often) they just disappoint. When they are right (sometimes) so what. They don’t swing stocks. They aren’t reliable enough to make purchase decisions. But they get clicks.
126 2018-08-20 22:22:49 Yes. What I meant was that workers do not have the power to bite off a bigger chunk of the pie (higher wages with in turn lower corporate profits). That was what pressured stocks in the 70s, corporations bore the cost of inflation. This time it is workers while corps thrive.

132 2018-08-20 22:20:35 @FrontierCorp So, let's think this logically... You cut off services for incomplete pymt, which means no phone service with which to call to make payment (if your agents ever picked up phone anyway). And your Chat with an Agent feature is a joke. Wonder why your stocks suck ATM?

$AAPL, $VEEV, $FFIV, $JKHY, $LDOS
134 2018-08-20 22:20:16 I buy egg stocks instead of oil.
135 2018-08-20 22:19:38 Cannabis stocks are in a bull run ! That will ease this crypto bear run
Think I've learnt to diversify now got to stop closing longs to early diff mentality needed leaving money on the table 
136 2018-08-20 22:16:18 I am doing the same as you. I have bought and sold along the way but I am keeping a small core position. I am just waiting to sell my $50@Oct 19th call which I certainly didn’t expect it to have moved up this quick for sure...Giving it one more day... 
137 2018-08-20 22:14:33 NEOGEN PACT stocks slump
138 2018-08-20 22:13:49 I trade a fair amount. Made a couple busts but also have made over 100% on 3 different stocks
139 2018-08-20 22:12:38 The best scenario is stocks materially lower for long term appreciation.  If everything is so great, return to historical norms of 5-7%
140 2018-08-20 22:11:27 Haha ok man I can’t help what the share price was 3 or 4 months ago and I have no idea who you are. Stocks go up and they go down. Good luck all.
141 2018-08-20 22:11:25 I fell in love like a soul lost in hell, posted bail for my heroin addict mistress, we roll like she in the buisness, kisses and hugs and a thug for any risk n swinces, winces at the hitch like witches with broomsticks, smokin flood like childrens of the world in a stocks senses
142 2018-08-20 22:10:39 TWN Stocks: Mitac Holdings (3706神達) is in deep trouble - sales has declined precipitously this year and, thru the first half, nearly 94% of its earnings came from sales of Synnex (NYSE SNX) shares - its core business is barely profitable.   I'd RUN and not look back.
143 2018-08-20 22:10:06 If stock holders never sell the market value of stocks does not matter because they will not be competing with others to buy goods and services with that wealth so it's inconsequential, if they do sell the prices would fall. So it is the yields (stock buy backs=yields).

I'M 83, I BUY AND SELL STOCKS FROM OPEN TO CLOSE, I BUY AND SELL METALS ALSO, I WORK ON MY GENEALOGY IN MY SPARE TIME, I PREPARE ALL 3 MEALS A DAY, I HAVE TWO CATS THAT REQUIRE MY ATTENTION.  MY HUSBAND DIED 5 YEARS AGO FROM LEWY BODY!!!
153 2018-08-20 22:02:34 How about buying stocks?
154 2018-08-20 22:02:05 Sad to see many ICOs from last year and this year didn't seem to have any money management skills. Just letting their $ETH run free and now they are all regretting it. Instead of putting say $30 mil ETH into fiat, stocks, bonds, precious metals, many chose to sit & lose money.
155 2018-08-20 22:00:25 Its been a rough year for Canadian stocks in general, especially the venture, WEED being the exception
156 2018-08-20 21:57:58 The same fears as the market embarked on this 8 week uptrend. 

Hope you guys bought back after you dumped stocks in Jan/ Feb
157 2018-08-20 21:56:55 3. We agreed as a whole that a society needs commerce and protection. That is a shared responsibility. What is not our responsibility is providing free health care, free college, free cars, free homes and whatever other goodies one feels entitled to.
158 2018-08-20 21:56:14 “I own a piece of a company and share stocks” is code for “I’m a drug dealer.” 
159 2018-08-20 21:55:45 trump has done nothing that helps the poor and lower middle class except cut whatever assistance they have.  43% of the country(again, lower end of income scale) was NOT helped by the Tax Scam, only the wealthy and some upper middle class.  Not everyone has stocks, can't afford.
160 2018-08-20 21:55:23 2. was courtesy of the private sector. Every drop of asphalt, every pre-fab post, every piece of iron. Private sector made it. All the government did was shovel bodies to it. Nothing more. Everything the police and fire have is...private sector made.
161 2018-08-20 21:54:10 Ok..Constitution has a commerce clause to it. Government's job is to ensure free flow of goods. Roads are a necessity. However, before you claim "socialism", understand that roads were built with private sector materials. Every bag of concrete, every heavy lifter and dirt mover..

1. Keeps the weekly perspective. 
2. LT is #bearish,Buy pyramid, at least 3 stages. sell at once.
3.took a hit when correlation diverge. Analyzing #btc and trading #alt/#xrp is a dangerous play. 
4. Stocks is the rule. #crypto is the exception.
214 2018-08-20 21:06:44 Even with a flow metaphor, you have private net worth increasing at a much faster rate than deficits accumulate. That is why the stocks are so unequal, because the flows that feed them are unequal. But your law holds otherwise? [Insert tit-for-tat gratuitous personal attack here]
215 2018-08-20 21:06:26 Elon’s made up character performance is falling apart he hasn’t made profit in 15 years, tries to manipulate stocks regardless of market, probably not actually an emerald mining inheritance, he fetishizes women of color and had his goth girlfriend hopped up on meth.

246 2018-08-20 20:54:45 Finding the balance between theory and practice is key. Reading investing books for 6 months without buying anything -> bad. Trading stocks for 6 months without educating yourself -> also bad.

249 2018-08-20 20:53:41 If you win over the long-term, don’t worry about short-term variance. Same reason you don’t sell good stocks in downturns... you just have to ride it out and don’t watch the balance sheet critically.

252 2018-08-20 20:51:23 Some CNBC crews look dump. A few days ago, Apple is the growth stocks and say you've gotta buy now and today say other things. High valuation is still out there. What a joke. What i see is that Apple is expensive and should not trade at this price. The valuation is the US is high
253 2018-08-20 20:50:29 Is this due to the accelerated nature of crypto cycles vs. stocks, etc?
254 2018-08-20 20:50:03 3. How dumb do governments have to be to not understand that doing a lousy job regulating banks decreases value of stocks in their pension plans?
255 2018-08-20 20:49:21 I think the #ManafortJury purchased pharmaceutical stocks and are just waiting for more antacid & ulcer medication sales before they return with a verdict.
256 2018-08-20 20:48:50 That's where we differ strongly. If many banks are using it as a settlement layer there is strong incentive to disrupt network. Someone could have short bets on banking stocks. In POW or POS they'd lose a fortune trying to do that.

259 2018-08-20 20:47:42 2. If governments want to reduce poverty and increase economic growth, value of stocks in their pension plans - index capital gains tax for inflation and use financial transactions taxes to pay for eduation, infrastructure, police, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.

268 2018-08-20 20:44:25 Normally I don’t advocate selling early but I saw the writing on the wall and got out while I was still making money. Maybe a mistake? I invested in defense stocks with my gains.

277 2018-08-20 20:37:37 Distillate stocks were drawing down quickly at the start of 2018, at a time when the global economy was strong and oil demand was growing at a blistering 1.8-million-barrel-per-day rate year-on-year. This summer, however, distillate inventories began to rise
278 2018-08-20 20:37:13 the recent increase in distillate stocks is a red flag for the health of the global economy. Distillates, such as road diesel, marine fuels and jet fuel, reflect activity in the industrial sectors and global trade levels

291 2018-08-20 20:22:59 @denisegrimsley You say  you’re pro gun. What does that mean? To me, it means keeping guns away from people who kill people (abusers, mentally ill, felons, those w/ a history of violence) using actionable background checks on all purchases, banning bump stocks, large ammo mag.
292 2018-08-20 20:20:12 What other right do u need proficiency test for? How do u enforce safe storage w/out going into peoples houses? How many chances to save a life would u limit a magazine to? Bump stocks not required 4 bump firing, not sure what use banning them does. Age req already a thing.

336 2018-08-20 19:56:53 Q: SS, Why do you post "Top Decliners"

A: Some are stocks that have been manipulated down in price if you look at Level 2, but the goal is to always try to get the best entries possible in any stock for a possible trade of some type. They can only take certain ones so low.

385 2018-08-20 19:29:09 To me, what is very strange is this kind of questions:

"Remind me - where'd the SNB get their money to buy those stocks?"

It means lack of knowledge how the money really works and moves around the World

That can be fixed starting another course of Public Finances, etc

Gold? Their mandate is clear and they do not buy it more, of course
397 2018-08-20 19:21:14 PSA for everyone under the age of 25:

-Please take a look at the things you spend money on.

-If you had put the money you spent on Cigs/Beer/Drugs since being an adult in to either Tech Stocks or Canadian Marijuana stocks you wouldn’t have as many worries.

-Invest in yourself.

400 2018-08-20 19:20:24 I’m no wolf of Wall Street or anything but investing in stocks is pretty exciting. Especially when you invest in a cannabis stock that has a nice increase over just one day.
401 2018-08-20 19:20:14 Conceptually,  you are correct
However the reality is that all of our media is owned by 5/6 entities, manipulated by corporations. GE, a military extension is one

Thus, our news & information is designed to keep us promoting THEIR  profits. This includes war, stocks, economics
402 2018-08-20 19:18:47 @AriMelber do political appointees need to publicly disclose all financial holdings. I.e. stocks they own etc?
403 2018-08-20 19:17:14 They sound as old school as the people still owning their stocks for the dividends
404 2018-08-20 19:16:39 $REFR would have been a good ticker for a pot stock. haha Pot stocks are doing quite well today with Jupiter trine neptune-should continue tomorrow
405 2018-08-20 19:16:22 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your carpal tunnel syndrome

413 2018-08-20 19:10:08 And its pretty funny how CNN is unreliable only in matters related to Trump . They seem pretty on point when it comes to plane crashes, natural disasters, stocks, and pretty much every other subject . But if Trump tells you jump, you jump
414 2018-08-20 19:10:08 But even better would be cloning more than 1 investor as it gives you more stocks .
415 2018-08-20 19:10:03 2.) Traders trade. The investors driving the higher trading volume in ETFs are going to be trading something. If it's not ETFs, it would be stocks.

417 2018-08-20 19:09:09 Not sure i get the point..
Greece for example went through a deep recession.. the whole stock market fell almost 70%..
Best stocks to own..none really..
418 2018-08-20 19:07:39 Pot stocks up nicely. Just sitting on them. No trading, same as when they're down hard. Long is the way to go in my opinion.

424 2018-08-20 19:02:13 It makes absolutely NO sense.
The media loves to showcase folks with  an unhealthy view on a specific stock/asset (I'm also looking at you stocks, gold, & crypto). Where it is ALWAYS a buy (or always a sell). Where the opinion is absolute.
The market doesn't deal in absolutes.

434 2018-08-20 18:57:17 I feel like education and permitting is probably a better approach, banning full auto and burst fire weapons from common distribution measures all ready in place. Additional bans on devices to up the rate of fire of sa weapons (bump stocks) are probably sensible as well.

450 2018-08-20 18:46:54 True, and even if he was a masked Muskman he'd be too busy dropping acid and ruining his stocks regardless

452 2018-08-20 18:45:43 I believe that he is still successful with Tesla branding. But some problems with the financial management and stocks. I don’t think so it will affect SpaceX emotionally because they are professional. And, in the short term, SolarCity is more important than SpaceX.
453 2018-08-20 18:45:11 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.

Am I getting it right???

499 2018-08-20 18:23:19 I agree with that. The valuation anomaly should persist as long as passive flows dominate, which could be a while.  That just means that the expected return of the "popular" stocks will keep falling. Owning the dropouts could the best LT strategy, if you can take the ST pain

534 2018-08-20 18:08:02 The 2 major reasons why NYSE volume went up 2000% from early 90s to mid 2000s was 1). Educated access for retail to quantitative market analytics and 2). The rise of ETFs.  Hence stocks/options markets decimalized much narrower margins.  Everybody wins with higher volume

“Liquidity” - the degree to which an asset or security can be quickly bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price.

543 2018-08-20 18:03:38 So google now shows stocks values in "realtime" and it's amazing to watch an event live and the market reaction at the same time
544 2018-08-20 18:03:36 Block Netflix drop your Subscription. Stocks start dropping Netflix will rethink Or Rice (best accomplice) will run Netflix out of business trying to keep them on. Obambam if he would tell the truth on there..nope even then we already know he sold Our Country Out!
545 2018-08-20 18:03:32 Impressive how Stocks are unresponsive to bonds utterly tanking.

550 2018-08-20 18:01:44 Markets go through irrational bull runs all the time. 

By your logic because of Enron and HMNY stocks are not a consistent system either. 

Bitcoin as a protocol is consistent. As a traded asset it is upwards volatile on the long term.

Remind me what the price was a year ago.
551 2018-08-20 18:01:44 @ArmadaUGS I played multiple fox dittos literally right after you gave me that advice and I took multiple games by 3 stocks

Thanks a lot man.

554 2018-08-20 18:00:24 Exactly.  I think age is a factor in ridiculing stocks. I didn't start investing in stocks until i was 29. Most young people today prefer cryptocurrency and laugh at stocks.  I laugh back

564 2018-08-20 17:54:49 This is an issue to which I can speak. Before any stock purchases or sales, unless previously advised, my financial advisor checks with me directly for approval. This is to avoid any conflicts of interest or any stocks in companies I do not consider ethical. Standard practice.

575 2018-08-20 17:49:55 It's not a switch. There's a whole range of agreements (on trade, animal health, peace, environment, fish stocks, space, food definitions, transport etc) that cut across EU/NI/GB/UK lines and all need renegotiating or replacing.

610 2018-08-20 17:27:26 Save yourself a lot of trouble by trading those stocks that are staging clear breakout or reversal moves in the present, never on what you THINK a stock will or won’t do.
611 2018-08-20 17:26:24 The struggle is real! 
The mother found caffeine-free Diet in 2L bottles - nobody ever stocks those! She grabbed a couple for me so that should keep me going for a while.
612 2018-08-20 17:25:41 And there goes the $CVSI party.  Very risky to chase stocks, especially pot stocks.
613 2018-08-20 17:25:23 There is no fixed way how you can position your trades based on opening. There are certain patterns you can find which work and apart from that the strength of the gap up has to be seen based on the stocks that are contributing to the rally.
614 2018-08-20 17:25:12 Three Rules of Investing I Live By:

Rule #3: Never Panic, Stay The Course
615 2018-08-20 17:25:04 As they should.  Similar to those people who invest vast sums of money in penny stocks in hopes of becoming a multi-millionaire.

620 2018-08-20 17:20:49 Just wanted to clarify WHY I own the admittedly few Tesla stocks that I do. The reason is NOT to make boat loads of money. The reason is to change the world.  Save the planet and the life forms on it.  I’m a retired “old guy”.  The Tesla Team are doing it.

663 2018-08-20 16:55:58 this was the second non fixed income (equity) guy to mention this to me in as many days, both are  convinced that rates are about to fall much lower, yet they both remain super duper bullish stocks!
664 2018-08-20 16:55:52 That where it ends up anyway(invested in stocks n derivatives), it’s not in your bank account technically, 90% is lent out to be invested. Cuts out a lot of middle men. Good idea!

672 2018-08-20 16:51:23 When sentiments are bullish across the board, most stocks do well regardless of their fundamentals. 

Prefer buying what has done well over last many years at 10-20% dip.

673 2018-08-20 16:51:06 I've been out to Sainsbury's now. There were hardly any fresh meats in stock for 3 days (as per screenshots...but they only showed 2 pages - there were loads more out of stocks than that). Also lots of cooked meats out of stock. Really poor. My Smart Pass is wasted for this week

677 2018-08-20 16:48:47 That’s pure ignorance on your part IMO. You’re making that statement based on prior experience with high-flying pot stocks. This one’s bullish sustained move is based on legitimate fundamentals
678 2018-08-20 16:48:30 Also amazing is how Liberals throw their fits saying we need more 'prevention' yet their idea of 'prevention' is banning bump stocks & increase buying age to 21...not keeping guns away from a murderous ideology that says they will kill.

682 2018-08-20 16:47:36 Stock buy backs have this market on a new sugar high. They dont increase wages or or the economy. Slow long term growth would be a good sign for wall street. Thats not what were seeing. Pull your stocks on get stuck holding the bag when the oligarchs pull out.
683 2018-08-20 16:47:27 20 years of experience and your answers make zero sense. I want you to explain what under-cuts are..fake walls....bid taps of 400 shares...etc...you are saying shorts have no interest in stocks like $BYOC so please explain OTCX and everything mentioned above if not short interest
684 2018-08-20 16:46:50 When i remember correctly the lows of the stock price in April have been around $245 when the 2025 bonds hit their lows at around ,86. So we are back at the $TSLA bond lows now but stock still trading around $300. The bond investors have always been more diligent than the stocks.

What I love about sub is that they are a solid company that I would invest in if they were in the regular stock market. They solve a problem that extends well out of crypto.

705 2018-08-20 16:39:46 Oui c'est juste lié a la reconstruction des stocks des entreprises. Il s'agit d'une croissance minable par rapport aux rattrapages habituels. De plus, cette croissance ne va pas se poursuivre en 2019 a cause de l'austérité, du resserrement monétaire et du poids de la dette.
706 2018-08-20 16:38:42 Were those penny stocks available to 14 year olds in South Korea, as was crypto? Crypto was the first investment that was available to anyone in the world with an internet connection. That is sold as the great promise. Don't sell the promise and wave away the downside.

731 2018-08-20 16:27:30 Doesn't matter for now Greg. Their next move is obvious. Leak information every few days about possible trade deal with China, stocks will rally. Strange given that they didn't sell off when the trade war started bur there it is.

733 2018-08-20 16:26:07 Could stockpiling for a no-deal #Brexit boost the UK economy? Pantheon's @samueltombs doesn't think so.

737 2018-08-20 16:25:33 This is disingenuous because you could copy and paste the same text and swap out cryptocurrencies for stocks, bonds, equities and in some cases, like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, fiat in the bank and you still reach the same down 90% for an unsophisticated retail investor outcome.

801 2018-08-20 15:58:12 Dividends for equities aren't really the payoff that your article indicates, many of today's most popular stocks do not pay a dividend and are yet priced very aggressively.   The payoff for these assets as upwards price action for that asset.

812 2018-08-20 15:52:55 Dow Jones U.S. airlines index up about 2.9 percent, helped by gains in stocks of United Continental, Allegiant and Southwest Airlines $UAL $LUV | via @Reuters
813 2018-08-20 15:52:31 Sir, how much importance you give to PE of individual stocks while buying, or do you totally ignore if it fulfills your other criteria?
814 2018-08-20 15:52:22 Stocks going up 
815 2018-08-20 15:52:11 Wild action on "pot" stocks again today.  Daytraders loving the action if their timing is correct. Those buying much cheaper, still don't mind holding. But, those buying too high unless you are WEED, are still bruised by the drop from ATHs.

>> ... if people do not buy stocks or houses, it goes to zero ... <<

You can live in a house, or rent a house out. Stocks give you ownership rights in a company. Virtual currencies are vapor.
818 2018-08-20 15:51:20 August was the start of last year's Cryptoasset boom. While ending in January, the price is still higher from the initial rally. Investments take time, and in crypto people expect shit to happen over night. This shit is stocks on crack regardless. I wish people saw that.
819 2018-08-20 15:50:31 one more question how you pick your stocks?
820 2018-08-20 15:49:31 “We have been saying this for some time now. Investing for yield in S&P500 is pointless when you have European stocks & even short term treasuries yielding better. The U.S. is not the place for income right now” Jasper Reimers on current income investing in the U.S
821 2018-08-20 15:49:24 Pay 30% of it as tithe and first fruit.
Invest 30% stocks and bonds and spend the rest on missions and evangelism.
822 2018-08-20 15:47:20 Economy is booming only if you have stocks! You have stocks? Most middle and low income don’t have stocks and no trickle down!
823 2018-08-20 15:47:19 S&P 500 approaching all time high set back in early 2018? Should investors chase? Probably not. S&P 500 EPS growth peaking and no need to be greedy. Balanced investors should be market-weight stocks for now.
824 2018-08-20 15:47:05 when? 2099.... fears sells doesnt it...  elite doesnt want a crash... no crash coming...learn how ur markets work and who manipulates them! the crowd doesnt own the stocks yet... so no crash!
825 2018-08-20 15:45:55 It's tough to knock people who have been 100% correct over the last decade.

Stocks were the place to be.

Even now they are pretty attractive next to bonds.

840 2018-08-20 15:38:43 These are excluding the RSUs and bonuses, which generally make at least half of their income. Also makes things much harder to compare since an earlier employee might be making $160K in salary but $340K in stocks vs new employee who has salary of $200K but stock of $100K.

920 2018-08-20 14:54:53 So yesterday I decided to netplay some random person from Mexico. I usually do pretty good in netplay. I always take about 2 stocks. This guy I played 4 stocked me 7 times in a row. It shows how much I still have to improve. I suck... and I couldn’t be happier that I suck
921 2018-08-20 14:54:46 SEC under pressure from the oil lobby,  Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen etc, etc, etc...sure the stock is over-priced, CEO is overworked and needs to delegate. In other news demand for dumb phones takes-off think FANG stocks.
922 2018-08-20 14:54:33 No, we do get crappy stocks at times (in small cap especially). But again our allocation is 2-5% of overall capital to any one stock...so worst case scenario we get a lemon and we lose 50%-70% on that one stock once in a while.

we are ok with that.

926 2018-08-20 14:53:06 One of the biggest possible assaults on investing behavior can be when the market, for no reason, decides to "drop bombs" on #stocks you own. It can lead to damaging & irrational decisions. Waiting for reversion can seem like an eternity. Are you strong enough to hold the line?
927 2018-08-20 14:52:22 Invest in stocks ?

929 2018-08-20 14:51:38 Why would we want to slam our president. He HAS made America great again. Stocks are up GDP at almost an all time high. People are working with lowest unemployment for blacks, hispanics and women ever! He IS the best president I've ever voted for! @realdonaldtrump
930 2018-08-20 14:51:37 Went out with a big Hedge Fund buddy of mine shorting $TSLA off that spike was a big trade now rolling the puts. Also mentioned long $GDX. The little tidbits are good but time frame matters when talking stocks so know ur time frame & know the time frame of the person you're with.

1089 2018-08-20 13:32:08 That's not really how stock investing works. You're just buying the shares from someone else who is selling. You need to study investing more before you invest in individual stocks. The stock market teaches very expensive lessons. I'm afraid you're about to get one.

1097 2018-08-20 13:27:09 Is Midrash reliable? Of course, but you have to use it correctly. A compass, eg, is a reliable way to find north, but not a reliable way to choose stocks. 

Likewise, Midrash is a reliable way to discover what ancient rabbis thought, not a reliable way to determine what happened.
1098 2018-08-20 13:26:45 Like I said. Bump stocks aren’t banned. If they were going to make them illegal they would have done it by now. Trump was just giving lip service to gun control groups. Bump stocks aren’t banned. Like I said

1112 2018-08-20 13:22:38 Such investors that want BTC exposure but can't or don't want to buy BTC, and so buy Bitmain instead, will very likely push its valuation too high. A basket of 80% semiconductor stocks and 20% BTC will then outperform Bitmain.

1165 2018-08-20 12:53:04 Respectfully, as much as I have been a bear on $TSLA, it is a completely different story than the other high momentum stocks as the former's business model is the problem while the latter stocks are more a question of valuation. Very different.

1176 2018-08-20 12:44:50 Nope I said something like “Feeling down about the stock market, check out $ASNT” as I was feeling really shitty about all my stocks being down and saw room to grow when it dipped below Series D. Everyone was really happy to get in under the last pre-IPO round. Should I delete?

1187 2018-08-20 12:41:15 If those were stocks and shares...I'd wonder what the bad news was in 2013. This years extended cull areas will only accelerate the downward trend. All the while generating more understanding and acceptance of the need to be pro active where disease is concerned.

1195 2018-08-20 12:33:34 Maybe stocks and bonds are on the same page, after all! So far in Aug, the SPX cyclical index is down 60 bps and the SPX defensive index is up 300 bps. This performance gap dovetails with the NY Fed freshly minted GDP slowdown to 2.4% for Q3 (down from 2.8% at the end of July).

1230 2018-08-20 12:05:21 The venture capital community does a good job of hiding its failures through M&A (one portfolio company acquires 2nd failing company = loss becomes a win). Wonder if we'll see similar with high flying, recently public tech stocks? $QQQ $SQ $SHOP $GOOGL

1590 2018-08-20 06:07:40 If people are so determined to keep getting their jollies by speculating on things, they should stick to traditional things like stocks or scratch tickets.

Do one's own analysis that finds leading stocks.

Develop a risk management system that only allows for  small losses.

1650 2018-08-20 04:51:04 For most stocks/ index in India most gains happen overnight. If trading costs were lower buying at end of day/ selling opening is a pretty good strategy. 

A hueristic  (for traders): if you are convinced you want to exit - do it at the opening. 

Similarly buy at closing.

1691 2018-08-20 04:14:02 True. It's because of the stock buybacks that the tax cut allowed. That's happening instead of wages going up. Good for us with stocks, terrible for people who make much less than us. That's not a win.

1791 2018-08-20 02:43:51 Financial thinking has always found a need to establish a growth-value dichotomy for investors in different market cycles—e.g., stocks-to-gold performance ratio.

#Bitcoin might dilute this duality: tech-style growth plus monetary value equals the best asset in history.

1802 2018-08-20 02:31:06 Anyways, people are getting too jumpy on this topic. This is my opinion. I've worked hard to earn every penny in my life. Never cared to invest in stocks. Friends laughed at me all along until 2008 hit and they lost everything. Altcoin traders will suffer the same fate IMO.
1803 2018-08-20 02:30:46 Carolyn good night. A kindly question. These stocks and charts that you re analyzing  are selected by which criteria? Or have been selected by you aleatory? Thanks
1804 2018-08-20 02:30:36 It's funny cuz TEL is one of my biggest bag... along with XRP. I'm just not as optimistic as you fanboys are.

1814 2018-08-20 02:19:32 2017 was because of Obama economy plus business liking deregulation and buying back their own stocks with the taxscam.
