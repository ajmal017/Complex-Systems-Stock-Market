2 2018-05-01 23:57:27 Right, but he’s been used in back to back games twice this year he’s not getting burned out.  He started part of the year in the minors last year and then came up and had a big role in the pen.  I just really don’t see why a decent starter is better than a dominant reliever...

18 2018-05-01 23:42:15 We ALREADY have background checks, clearly that’s not working, you can blame Obama for bump stocks but no worries, TRUMP fixed that mistake. Silencers only muffle the sound so as not to damage hearing. Assault Weapons are not legal anywhere, as of 1994.  You KNOW this.

44 2018-05-01 23:35:27 Great idea. I took a personal wealth mgmt class to learn so pass along when I can. Basic: no cc debt, 6 mo. savings, then max tax-free 401k contribution and put into index funds: 50/50 stocks & bonds. Of those, half international, half domestic. Next: max Roth IRA contribution.

49 2018-05-01 23:32:58 So he will burn out by August throwing 80 innings a year but not 180-200?  He is in a dominant role right now.  Move him to the rotation and even if he’s does well he can only affect every 5 games and lineups can be set up as ideally as possible to face him.
50 2018-05-01 23:32:22 Take him at his word Jim: "Buffett has often said he avoided tech stocks in the past because he didn't really understand how they were making money and whether they would be able to do so over the long term." Whereupon one cannot speak, one must remain silent. End of story.
51 2018-05-01 23:31:05 Could remember last year if one if my stocks went up 20% 30% wasent even that excited it was the norm . Now I am excited if I see a 3.5% gain . Wow what a difference of 1 year. But shirt term pain for long term gain

62 2018-05-01 23:24:42 1. I'm really curious as what Trump has done that you hate so much? He has lowered taxes for everyone and businesses. Promotes small business, which in turn makes everyone richer, he wants fair trade for USA, house prices are up, stocks are up, promotes woman and minoritys
63 2018-05-01 23:23:27 RT GujralAshwani "Look for a market perception to be proven erroneous to get the biggest moves on the other side. That does not happen everyday, but when it happens its powerful. eg tech stocks, icici at 260 etc, becoz people are trapped on da other side"

69 2018-05-01 23:19:56 Agreed. It will come when @UtopyaTech is ready. I’ve been messaged by many now with “buyers regret” in this company not to start asking on their behalf. Several have stated $ANDI was the “worst investment ever”, all while watching other #stocks soar. #startup #utopya #UTOP

76 2018-05-01 23:14:57 It's a shame that jackasses like Swan can't be punished more than being voted out. He should be in stocks at Portage & Main with his fellow NDP criminals.
77 2018-05-01 23:14:49 Best to just let this one go or short pre-market and try to catch dips then and follow up with longs after the major dips. I have seen a lot of stocks lately that just keep running or that stay flat though fundamentals don’t support it. This is not the same mkt as 6 months ago

82 2018-05-01 23:11:54 If the bond yields go up, it makes sense to think that money will transfer into bonds from stocks. However, should I really expect the markets to tank?

87 2018-05-01 23:06:32 no, he did not approve anything. bump stocks are manufactured in a way that the ATF could not ban them. lack of mechanical aid prevented them from using the law to ban them.

89 2018-05-01 23:02:03 Yes it's all three.  Not enough discipline to save, poor investment performance, and stagnating real wages.  If stocks and bonds both underperform over the next 20 years compared to the previous 20 years  (a good assumption)  we could have a problem here...

92 2018-05-01 22:59:17 Hydro One was 100% gov owned, but because of how the liberals love to waste money Wynne needed money so sold stocks for quick cash. Gov still retains majority. But due to liberal math, & their lack of knowing how to do it, the sale loses the province 1.1 billion in dividends.

111 2018-05-01 22:41:03 How is someone that shorts a stock a shareholder?

They borrow stocks to sell then have to buy them back to return.  They don't hold the stock.  They trade it.

And you understand my point perfectly well.  Short term traders of a day or two are different from long term holders.

128 2018-05-01 22:30:35 I’m not missing your point. There are believers out there that will use what you said about his velocity as a reason to not start him.  He’s getting stronger, improved mechanics and his development of understanding in how to pitch is the what’s lost here. Just my opinion
129 2018-05-01 22:29:26 I used to dislike @ap4liberty very much, but it seems like he is by far the most Pro-Gun candidate out there (I mean the guy gives away bump stocks and Remington 700s, doesn’t get much more American than that)
130 2018-05-01 22:29:12 My state senator just voted against banning bump stocks and back ground checks. I'm so glad to have a much better option in @ChristinePMarsh come November. #ThrowThemOut #REDForEd #azleg

136 2018-05-01 22:25:57 DYOFR, the failure rates and capital loss make penny stocks look like a safe bet.

140 2018-05-01 22:25:01 House debating bill that would ban "bump stocks." In opening statements, Rep.

248 2018-05-01 21:13:16 I hope people know that these celebrities invest their money in stocks....just because you stream, or dont stream it, isn’t essential to them eating or not eating/paying their bills for the month.....they have accountants for a reason..not just to monitor how much they spend....

255 2018-05-01 21:10:04 I'm more of a Debt Markets fan than into stocks. Not so much into stocks, because of their "frequency" (rather than short-term volatility). Bonds gives you that predictability in the long-term. (of course, there are always grey areas in between)

257 2018-05-01 21:09:20 Because the majority of tax cuts went to the rich and big corporations. The big corporations were supposed to hire more people, expand, etc but they used money to buy back their stocks. 2-3% of workers got a one time bonus but not a salary raise.

260 2018-05-01 21:08:34 aapl like most reporting stocks have buybacks and tax cuts to support share price and neither have worked for any of them so far. i suspect aapl will find the same fate. Q1 data and earn has shown us that equities likely peaked now the few remaining bulls need to accept it
261 2018-05-01 21:08:27 Trump’s Dr Bornstein says when Trump’s people took his medical records he felt “raped”!!! Does he really think giving up documents compares to a woman being raped?? Men who say that should be put in wooden stocks in the town square so women can smack the crap out of them
262 2018-05-01 21:08:07 I bought some AAPL today for a trade and need to decide where to sell it tomorrow. I am afraid they will sell the rally again like other FAANG stocks and if that is the case it will be a BIG problem for the market.

308 2018-05-01 20:56:03 Enough to get really excited about the reinvigoration of tech leading stocks higher.
309 2018-05-01 20:56:01 Services once again grew beyond expectations. Hardly a mention. Just “soft” iPhone sales. Any company on the planet would die for such “soft” sales. Apple has become the Rodney Dangerfield of stocks.

383 2018-05-01 20:20:48 I think you have a very narrow definition of "use". What is gold "used" for? What are stocks "used" for?

385 2018-05-01 20:19:00 well i am sceptical of all paid stockletters. if i am any good at picking stocks, why do i have to sell myself ? in the 80s i did exactly that and didn't really make any $, so i paid my tuition already and i got my lesson lol

419 2018-05-01 20:04:58 Stocks cutting losses. S&amp;P now near unchanged, NASDAQ in positive territory. Dow -116 points after being down by over 300 points earlier

423 2018-05-01 20:03:49 I really appreciate what u do to oil traders Twitter community. Anyways im still with paper money   cuz im new in this field came from stocks
424 2018-05-01 20:02:54 As @TaylorPearsonMe points out in a recent article, there is around $700T worth of valued assets in the world but only $70T of fiat and $100T of stocks/bonds. Tokenization can potentially allow us to fill this gap by providing liquidity to otherwise illiquid assets.

450 2018-05-01 19:53:07 Civilians don't need access to high capacity magazines or bump stocks.  That's not hurting them not to have them.  That's a ridiculous insinuation.  I never said NRA members were criminals.  Not sure what you're talking about there.
451 2018-05-01 19:52:30 What’s the point of investing in stocks pre-hyperbitcoinization?
452 2018-05-01 19:52:03 All good dude; just trying to help, I was once blaming others for investing in this and that. In the end of the day this is penny stocks and no one really knows, all you can do is do your own DD and invest accordingly. It's a tough business, but riches are to be had.
453 2018-05-01 19:50:10 Spec stocks are so volatile even for the companies that have solid execution plan and even guaranteed rev stream - and those stocks which are hyping up on could be/would be are even more volatile in this high risk market.

482 2018-05-01 19:33:49 $aapl #apple last split (7:1) June, 2014 (almost 4 yrs) for $92+. Now $168 makes it a 82% gain in that timeframe. How many other tech stocks 200+%, 300+% in same timeframe? But reporting is APPLE, APPLE, APPLE! ENOUGH ALREADY! @CNBC

489 2018-05-01 19:29:34 No new calls for tommorrow but FSL, Radico Khaitan, Oberoi Realty & India Glycols still looks a buy check if they are at retest mode or near current market price. Also, these stocks may take a month or two for achieving targets.
490 2018-05-01 19:29:12 You see anything there about pumping penny stocks? Or dumping?

Nope.

Start saving for that rainy day libel retainer.
491 2018-05-01 19:29:05 Difference between putting bipods & scopes on AR10’s was maybe to make it more attractive to purchase, since the AR15’s were coming with bump stocks/fwd grips? Had to dress it up somehow to draw attention to them & it’s something that you might go buy anyway-the scope definitely!
492 2018-05-01 19:26:38 They use good looking women to pump stocks. Distraction.
493 2018-05-01 19:26:36 DC v. Heller.   Read that before you get too carried away. I’m not lobbying for anything, just arguing with a scared little snowflake.  You have convinced me of one thing- I should invest heavily in tin foil stocks.
494 2018-05-01 19:23:54 every market is manipulated. stocks, especially during earnings calls, forex, especially during quarterly trade commission revisits, commodities, crypto, etc.

501 2018-05-01 19:18:48 In interviews from 1976, Graham advocated buying low-priced stocks “regardless of the industry and with very little attention to the individual company." The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham, by Janet Lowe (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1999), p. 270.
502 2018-05-01 19:18:03 When you diversify by industry you have to compromise the goal of finding the lowest price stocks relative to earnings, cash flow, etc.
503 2018-05-01 19:17:45 without a doubt that's a bearish pattern but until you get that break and follow thru...  also indices, more than stocks, often have head fakes down and then reverse up.  One thing guaranteed, it won't be clear cut!

506 2018-05-01 19:16:38 Reminds me of the blunder I did last year,when started investing after Demonitization.Selected stocks expecting revival of rural economy. 25% allocation to Dalmia Bharat and Mahindra finance each.Booked profit and didn’t get chance to buy again.

510 2018-05-01 19:16:31 It's just start of the series. Keep it high enough and suddenly volume starts coming in. These days volume is deceptive and not a precise way to enter. Better is to go long with a stop loss. There are stocks which despite high volumes are not moving. Some with low volumes & up.
511 2018-05-01 19:16:22 Next time on, take your stocks along . I am sure the locals would soon learn to provide visitors with what they need to earn better living.
512 2018-05-01 19:16:08 Not so good news for consumer and financial stocks.
513 2018-05-01 19:15:53 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your fibromyalgia
514 2018-05-01 19:15:37 Generally speaking, it is a good idea to buy companies that own stocks that go up 36% which is exactly what $TGGI has done. They own 100 million shares of $BDCI which is up .0218. This is just one of many reasons to get into $TGGI

522 2018-05-01 19:11:40 wow, I feel proud of myself lol. Did the same as you on it. It also has a huge float so I thought that it will trade more like the big board stocks right?
523 2018-05-01 19:11:37 The market is bullish, Gartman is bullish, shit even I'm getting bullish on some stocks.... New highs ahead.
524 2018-05-01 19:10:47 My social life is so sad that when I’m in public, I check my stocks to avoid talking to people. My stocks for a school project.

526 2018-05-01 19:10:36 Your a penny stock scab, that has been charged with making multiple aliases on public stock forms to pump penny stocks. Your credibility is scab level! Lets cut the BS. I like FACTs.
527 2018-05-01 19:10:09 The 3 worst were not on his watch and he did have his AG bam bump stocks.  You’re not very intelligent, are you?

529 2018-05-01 19:08:39 So Senator Wyden what about all the Union Pensions and 401K's that are funded on stocks. Do they get their money on the buy backs? Or did these companies only offer them to their friends Illegaly?

532 2018-05-01 19:07:24 @Nasdaq how do I buy stock for NASDAQ, the commercial U.S stock exchange Corp? Not the stocks available to but but the whole Corporation of NASDAQ I would be interested in investing in. DM me if possible.
533 2018-05-01 19:06:51 We have no problem with them going to casinos, buying lottery tickets, betting horses and sports, buying penny stocks, margin trading, payday loans, unaffordable mortgages, anybody should learn by their own experience
534 2018-05-01 19:06:09 The legendary investors like Buffett have some idea about what stocks will do, hence they are determined to hold their stocks “forever”. I think it is the short term that we don’t have any idea about.
535 2018-05-01 19:05:29 You ever make money on oil stocks and then give it right back to them at the pump?
536 2018-05-01 19:05:19 Here’s a question (don’t answer it), have you sold any stocks to buy bitcoin? I’m guessing a hell of a lot of people have, and will continue to.

538 2018-05-01 19:03:16 It's troubling that SEC allows company likes Citron to promote & damage stocks to people by their license and do insider tradings at the same time. There is a major problem with the rules & laws of tradings by SEC in this country.

577 2018-05-01 18:39:58 Perhaps.  10-15 years from now, I do think the stock market will look very different. I'm not sure how bitcoin displaces income producing equities though. Will 401K's be entirely invested in stocks and bonds?  to your point, probably not.
578 2018-05-01 18:39:17 It’s no longer a passive ETF friendly market. It’s a market of stocks. I’m still up on all my holdings and about to add.

618 2018-05-01 18:21:12 Agree with your profitability numbers, but the only issue is these stocks do not trade at a PE multiple, rather they trade at an EV/EVIDTA level of close to 5 to 5.5.. And if you revise your targets on that basis, you will get a better indication of target price.. 
619 2018-05-01 18:20:32 Forget game on.  You need a game plan. Don’t buy a stock unless you have a game plan. Buying and holding like all those fsticks on stockhouse is not a great strategy. It’s a humbling biz the sooner you learn that the better. good luck with your stocks

653 2018-05-01 18:02:37 It helps when you’ve played a lot of tournaments but taking deep breaths in between stocks helps a lot. 

It’s not bad to have tournament nerves, but it’s bad if you let them affect your gameplay. Try playing how you normally would, and maybe let some muscle memory kick in
654 2018-05-01 18:01:55 @JuneDW if you just start into trading, stay with stocks, not option not ETF such as $VXX $TVIX.

661 2018-05-01 17:59:55 .@GRsmashYT just an idea out of curiosity, would you ever be willing to do a "top 10 worst share-stock moments?" like, a player share-stocks when the other player's at like 120% and then they both get destroyed?
662 2018-05-01 17:57:31 Or to hear @IainDale solution to GFA, or to the FACT that fishing is about stocks, not borders, or to point our how badly the economy is stalling or that we need immigrants for more than they need us....

Good luck for all long/short term traders.
#Squeeze
695 2018-05-01 17:44:22 Yeah, that's one of the problems, too, is that "homes" have come to mean wealth generators/investments/retirement plans. There's too much incentive to keep housing/rental stocks low so that it keeps appreciating.
696 2018-05-01 17:44:20 Give a unique identification number like ISIN / cusip for stocks ..follow updates ..donate money . Make it autonomous like churches and mosques
697 2018-05-01 17:43:51 And because of the health craze, most of these stocks have been overlooked for years while they quietly prepare to serve the same stuff, but slightly healthier. 
In short, I think as marijuana reaches more markets, delivery will follow, and these places will benefit from both.
698 2018-05-01 17:43:16 Cbs head stocks on strats look awesome imo.  Be kind of cool if an American company bought it out instead of probably Chinese and made some small alterations.

700 2018-05-01 17:41:50 @AldiUK why remove the pepper corn sauce in the packet from your stocks and dauphinoise potatoe and cheese too! They are both popular products and get told from your staff they don’t know why as it’s a good seller?
701 2018-05-01 17:41:47 not happy $t this is one of my IRA income dividend stocks & I went from always green to now a little red
702 2018-05-01 17:41:39 Two stocks....my friend @saketvaani has deep funda view on. I track both, play in both, blessed to pick them everytime they are about to do JALWA. One of them is already doing good, another one just about to. Our respective forte, working like a charm

706 2018-05-01 17:38:43 Is the stock market down so they can buy their stocks cheap? Buybacks haven't helped shareholders since the stocks are down.
707 2018-05-01 17:38:30 We don't usually trade penny stocks!
708 2018-05-01 17:38:25 I like fast food stocks right now and have for a while. $MCD, $QSR, $JACK, $DPZ. Aside from dominoes, they're all prepared to take advantage of things like UberEATS as UberEATS reaches more and more markets. That's just delivery. They also will take advantage of marijuana (1/?)
709 2018-05-01 17:38:23 Human psychology/tendency to extrapolate:

721 2018-05-01 17:30:29 Any Russian Company; especially Arms & Energy Companies, where America's elite, wealthy Oligarchs hold stock in them, get stocks back. Protect & Preserve RU's interests at all costs. These people are demonic, if they invest, hold stocks; it opens the door to curses on our Co's.
722 2018-05-01 17:29:44 Yeah it’s been going on for the last 4 month it just that time were shorts taking control maybe because in their research all this stocks are over price. Not sure I’m just guessing
723 2018-05-01 17:29:13 Watch $AAPL increase dividend to make stock go up after ER. Tech stocks like $AMZN, $NVDA, $FB may follow $AAPL's  lead. I would pick some tech stocks before closing.
724 2018-05-01 17:26:57 Every industrial falling off a cliff. Is China about to go into a Great Depression? Price action in real economy stocks couldn't be any worse considering the strength in $HYG
725 2018-05-01 17:26:54 Thanks for the comment. I take your point in the sense that over the long-term, share buybacks don't ensure shares rise. A better way to phrase it would have been "all else equal buybacks tend to put upward pressure on share prices." It doesn't guarantee stocks rise.
726 2018-05-01 17:26:48 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow  when the stocks market goes down like it is, consumer spending gets tight, people get frugal - they get nervous about the funds for retirement.  Why would you put in policies to purposely send it down? Why??

745 2018-05-01 17:16:14 #ES The arrival of May marks the beginning of a six-month stretch that usually has been a weaker time to own stocks. Over the last 20 years, the S&P 500 has gained 0.3% on average between May and October, less than benchmark Treasury notes, versus 6.5% between November and April
746 2018-05-01 17:15:09 I guess not yet! it's @ 0.34 +62% As i have mentioned before, It's a great (Day Trade) until then! IMO

760 2018-05-01 17:07:29 Thanks! There's quite a bit of discussion about 'sector neutral' investing, which I think is superior. Also, I bet there were a lot of cheap tech stocks (Intel, Cisco, even Microsoft) that were cheap based on earnings and cash flows, but not P/B, thus excluded..just as an example
761 2018-05-01 17:07:21 I usually get nervous when any of my stocks decline 30-40% w/out a lot of news (what do others know that I don't?) But when most decline: $SGMO $AVDL $TRIL $LPTX $CORI $BLCM - I'm happy about opportunity to buy more & sell some of those that held up - It's ALWAYS worked!

763 2018-05-01 17:06:21 Trading Tip: In slow markets big fish get desperate to make money. Due to less legit movement, they may start to create more "opportunity" via orchestration.

780 2018-05-01 17:01:09 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.

786 2018-05-01 16:58:06 Great piece, Jim. An issue w/ value investing  is that at heart, value stocks are those priced substantially below intrinsic value and unless one derives the chosen multiple from fundamentals, no multiple can fill in for value. Some stocks have low PE levels because they should.
787 2018-05-01 16:57:52 No worries I attended one of your workshops about 4\5wks ago. I found really beneficial. Also ive watched your doc. You put some sterling points forward about the class trap and the arts. Best wishes.
788 2018-05-01 16:56:22 I suppose connecting up with sustainability is a problem even in the most mainstream nutrition. Perhaps we would be healthier if we all ate at least two portions of fish (inc. one oily fish) a week, but how long would fish stocks last if we did?
789 2018-05-01 16:56:08 Investing in something you do not understand is valid. But claiming that something is more of a gamble when you do not understand it is pretentious. Buffet is an expert on stocks but he needs to leave crypto to those who understand it

792 2018-05-01 16:54:20 One role of government is to keep citizens safe. That's why we have a military and why we have police. I'm firmly in favor of banning bump stocks and other mods that would make a semi-automatic fire like an automatic. I'm firmly in favor of limiting clip/magazine capacity.

861 2018-05-01 16:11:08 I always make more money swing trading in a bear market; where there are lots of oversold stocks from strong companies. It is a setup for swing trading at it's finest. One has to work much harder to find swing trades in a bull market. Bull markets are great for slow growth.

898 2018-05-01 15:56:48 NRA members and gun enthusiasts pick and choose to follow the 'law'  example.. bump stocks legal to buy for now not a weapon right? But you can't use them to modify your rifle or gun that's illegal. So millions bought bump stocks after LV mass shooting. What for? table ornament?
899 2018-05-01 15:55:24 I endorse comprehensive, universal background checks a all gun sales. I'm in favor of banning bump stocks and limiting magazine/clip capacities. I'm also on the fence about raising the age to buy guns to 21.
900 2018-05-01 15:55:02 Stocks down again. But this volatility is normal. Last year's market action was not.

1087 2018-05-01 14:25:09 The key to successful trading is to know which stocks to AVOID. Pick the "easier" plays, aka plays with setups u know in the past u have been consistently successful on, and AVOID the rest.

1118 2018-05-01 14:12:14 In 1970 the s&p was 92. In 1980 the s&p was 102. That's about 10% over 10 years or 1%/year before inflation. The chart is comparing apples to oranges and is misleading. The 70s we're bad times for stocks and the economy. Maybe it's not including inflation adjusted numbers.

DOW -200 POINTS
1121 2018-05-01 14:11:07 The arrival of May comes after more than three months of volatility, with stocks zig-zagging for a variety of reasons, including a softer stretch of economic data, the announcement of U.S. tariffs on China, the highest Treasury yields in years, and political concerns.

1172 2018-05-01 13:54:14 S&P 500 Index declined Tuesday morning, pulled lower by financials  and energy stocks. Ten-year Treasury yields held below 3 percent as the  greenback headed for its ninth gain in 11 days, with that strength  weighing on most commodities.

1185 2018-05-01 13:49:44 It's intriguing how later corporate financing will deal with a new concept of Tokenization. So far, it's been only in form of stocks and bonds the way companies can raise their capital. That's just a tiny proportion of how blockchain tsunamis solve real world problems.

1213 2018-05-01 13:36:48 NO,for longterm investor. Just look at where it has come from,  its normal for stocks to have pull backs.  Still looks like a stock you can own and trade part of position in the ups and downs. Don't forget all that cash

1220 2018-05-01 13:32:59 Point taken. But many more people sold to cause that drop on the R/S news. IMO just because a stocks price is 1-2 bucks doesn't mean there is automatically more "buy" interest. Especially when the reason the price is at that level is because of a R/S. The intrinsic value is same.

1254 2018-05-01 13:16:50 .@marcorubio my take pay is up. Cutting corp. taxes helps people bc they own corps via stocks; they benefit from either higher dividends or earnings which drive stock prices. Stock benefit many people who hold them directly or in retirement funds. Tax cuts are always WELL ADVISED

1312 2018-05-01 12:52:05 now try to make sense of many retail sector stocks at or near highs on the series of charts you just showed along w/ banks that increased provisions for loan losses or card delinquncies unless the consumer is buying everything on credit they'll never pay back
1313 2018-05-01 12:51:25 Thanks for the info. What stocks are you looking at this morning and why?
1314 2018-05-01 12:51:11 FAANG stocks: Average American can name CEO and/or founders of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, maybe even Netflix. I bet less than 10% can name the founders/CEOs of Google. (Maybe I should Google that?)

1320 2018-05-01 12:47:18 Starting with zero experience is next to impossible guys like me will simply take your money. Trading penny stocks is extremely dumb and rarely works out due to the fact they are so illiquid. It takes years of trial and error to actually know what you're doing. If you

1327 2018-05-01 12:40:56 The best way to test this hypothesis is to actually buy a small amount each in 3-4 "hot" stocks that are "sure" to go up. Check back in a year and compare them with the S&P 500.

1329 2018-05-01 12:40:14 I agree. Cyclical bear market in an on-going secular bull. Not the end of the world, but not great news either. Argues for shepherding cash and making lists of stocks to buy sometime later in the year.

1366 2018-05-01 12:03:32 How many of them have traders they look up to or trust who advise against crypto? I think a lot of industry people avoid it because there's no obvious value the way there is with stocks/bonds. That and Uncle Sam isn't clear on his views so maybe they want to stay "clean"

1414 2018-05-01 11:18:25 I agree with your point of view. Cheaper to buy than stocks & gives better returns than stocks. But why do people use a dollar sign beside each ticker of a token. For example Eth is Eth. Why do people refer Eth as $ETH. I thought the whole idea is to decouple from USD.

1427 2018-05-01 11:02:50 Jim, it’s hard to get excited about stocks when they are historically priced at twice the mean and every financial advisor points at the unemployment rate which most people believe is a farce

1435 2018-05-01 10:53:58 Alrighty then. If all this is so certain then surely your 401k is 100% in high risk international stocks then? I doubt it. I hope for your sake next time you’re in a major negotiation you’re able to check this emotional element at the door.

1437 2018-05-01 10:50:44 I agree with @airic101. When you look at the time when lithium was at its highest in mid Jan, and started to drop, most lithium plays started to decline as well, and the overall market conditions changed. I dont think the weed stocks hype is over. I see  AAZ  and LIB moving.
1438 2018-05-01 10:50:10 I'm very much into buying Quality Stocks and holding them Long Term these days. A lot depends on time/lifestyle and Trading In & Out works well if you are suited to it. I want great Stocks I can hold while they work for me.

1545 2018-05-01 09:05:06 Learn to read how people chart stocks. Not because they are correct, but because everyone thinks there is logic in the charts. 
Understand that the chart prediction is just herd mentality.

1547 2018-05-01 09:04:12 Well I pick the stocks based on volume and price movement. I look up the stock and loosely do some fundamental analysis... If the price goes up and down I'll look at the same stock or others based on the movement, cost and volume.This is also why I need to learn options some more

1551 2018-05-01 08:55:59 Same here. I think about it like this. If I spend $500 on a .05 stock and it moves to .06, I make $100 on .01 of movement ... I hope to be able to make those types of trades on 2-5 stocks per day ... If I can average that for 6-12 months I'll quit my job lol and go full time
1552 2018-05-01 08:54:55 Sure it is. Have to see how much stocks @Flipkart and @ASUSIndia are making available for the enthusiasts.

1556 2018-05-01 08:51:12 I already decided to dedicate $50-100/wk to invest in stocks and as it grows I'll leave it to make more money... Then I can eventually play with bigger stocks
1557 2018-05-01 08:49:42 Since I'm new I tend to gravitate towards stocks that are $1 or less. They can be more volitile but take much less movement to turn a decent profit

1589 2018-05-01 08:17:17 Yep, that’s what I covered in my second point. The theory of what goes up must come down doesn’t apply to stocks though... it’s just what people are used to with the pump & dump stocks like PREM.

1591 2018-05-01 08:12:50 Deary me.  You do know "cash" is an asset?  Very few people hold cash as it's a terrible asset.  It loses value every year.

Most of UK assets as held in stocks.  Something called QE.

1608 2018-05-01 07:43:51 aim still not on full throttle by a long way. But two weeks ago shares had news spiked 5 minutes then sell off. Now the bull is starting to return if news is good enough that sell off is bought up and stocks rewarded for progress.

1614 2018-05-01 07:38:04 Without protection though why would any American company invest in the United States, rather than China or another low-wage country? Many American corporations are swimming in money and don't seem to want to anything with it except buy back their own stocks!
1615 2018-05-01 07:35:34 London stocks were set to edge higher at the open on Tuesday as investors eyed the latest reading on the manufacturing sector, although trading was expected to be fairly quiet, with most European markets closed for Labour Day.
1616 2018-05-01 07:33:26 While some stocks attempt to move up, few may be taking breather before next move.

1692 2018-05-01 06:35:07 because no journalist is on our side. they have corporate owners, who have shareholders, who want stocks to go up. ratings make stocks go up. adversity makes ratings go up. that mf is as adverse & divisive as it gets.

1707 2018-05-01 06:11:52 And they want to outlaw bump stocks eh? As far as I'm concerned you invade a country when you come here waving & climbing our walls with your native flag. As for those who practice law eader to advice how to invade the States, you too should be held for treason!
1708 2018-05-01 06:11:30 The most common "argument" I see is
"If they're so good they should make enough themselves without having to charge!"

This is not logical at all. Think of the stock broker again, should he not charge for being your stock broker just because he could make money on stocks himself?
1709 2018-05-01 06:10:29 Many people don't see betting as an investment, but that's what it is. 

Say you wanted to invest into stocks to make money. Unless you know what you're doing you may hire a stock broker. Someone who does know what they're doing and charges you for their knowledge and service.

Lesson is to listen to your woman.

1801 2018-05-01 04:13:39 No it's not. Regulation prevents those trying to take unfair advantage.  It's like if the SEC was worth a shit regulating Wall Street.

1807 2018-05-01 04:08:01 huh?
1808 2018-05-01 04:04:54 Ehh, let's not say that stock trading is separate from the greater economy; it's very much the opposite, but that starts to delve into topics that 280 chars can't explain and dredges up some very complex & entangled concepts. But yes, stocks are very much like gambling!
1809 2018-05-01 04:04:17 Tim not only do you teach penny stocks and patterns, but you also teach common sense, self sufficiency, history, consistency, life lessons, hard work and that life is serious and can be made easy by studying our ass off. Keep up the good work.

1815 2018-05-01 03:59:19 Have not met single management over past eight years, and have never attended an AGM. Have still done reasonably well with my stocks. Inaction and working with publicly and easily available information has worked beautifully for me in #investing. Disclaimer - Walk your own path.
1816 2018-05-01 03:58:44 My stocks vest in August and I hate how much I’m gonna get taxed for them
1817 2018-05-01 03:57:19 Bought some new stocks
1818 2018-05-01 03:55:29 Actually its the other way round active funds have beaten Nifty 50, Nifty 100 because they used to hold 25% in mid/small cap stocks. besides they never used TRI index. All this is going to haunt them in future and many will start underperforming.

1820 2018-05-01 03:50:16 I think consideration should be given to a share trading halt until RC completed. Investors in bank stocks (as shareholders/owners) profited from the events created by persons they elected onto Boards & CEOs etc. I see no reason to allow such persons to take their profits and run
1821 2018-05-01 03:49:51 I’m setting up the stocks in the town square

1823 2018-05-01 03:43:50 WHY THE FUCK DOES SMASH 4 HAVE 2 STOCKS
1824 2018-05-01 03:42:37 October 1, 2017 is when the shooting happened that brought bump stocks into main stream media. I will also add I contacted him when he announced he was running and he didn't have anything on his site about his position then. It's sad.
1825 2018-05-01 03:42:33 The truth is, there’s only 5 digits in my bank at all time.
Almost all of my assets are in gold, silver, crypto, and some commodity stocks. (Maybe real estate on the next correction)

There’s no benefit in keeping it in banks with near negative interest rate.

1828 2018-05-01 03:38:51 Gah with all due respect, why not tell financial novices to index?  Picking stocks exposes you to more volatility and assumes you're better than the average market participant at valuing companies.  Also, get off my lawn.
1829 2018-05-01 03:36:32 Sending out @bhavemymoney at 11pm tonight made me feel like the @brianstelter of stocks!
1830 2018-05-01 03:35:17 Okay got that. So stocks are essentially finance capital and are based resources, and properties, goods and services of companies, banks, etc?
1831 2018-05-01 03:33:18 And there won’t be one; corporations did a buy-back of stocks, CEO’s gave themselves raises while super rich bought a 3rd vacation home, 2-Tesla automobiles, paid college for both kids & gave wives allowance increase of 100K if they agree to more sex 
1832 2018-05-01 03:31:24 Or some times the experts are dead right. But price movement is independent of it. Happens a lot in biotech stocks.
1833 2018-05-01 03:30:55 Hmmmm what to do...........yeah trade stocks. That’ll cure ya.
1834 2018-05-01 03:30:32 Name the last mass shooting in the United States where the shooter used an automatic gun?  They are extremely restricted.  Increasing the rate of fire for a semi-auto can do done with a belt loop, bump stocks aren't needed.  We have an issue with violence. Why not address that?

1841 2018-05-01 03:22:24 I disagree. Vegas happens a while ago and bump stocks have been a huge topic. It sounds like a lack of interest, much like ignoring my emails early in his campaign asking him about the 2nd Amendment. Couldn't be bothered.

1844 2018-05-01 03:21:11 “It turned out, therefore, that true ‘cash equivalents’ proved to be better investments in 1964 than common stocks - in spite of the inflation experience that in theory should have favored stocks over cash.” - Benjamin Graham
1845 2018-05-01 03:20:42 Stocks represent a percentage share of a company. If you own stock in a company, you own a share of that company proportional to the percentage of stock that you own. Shares are worth what people are willing to pay for them, and are most commonly traded on the stock exchange.

1850 2018-05-01 03:16:44 Well yes it is. Look at American Funds mutual Funds. Last year they did 16. Right now in May they are at 1 something. Four or five years ago they had negative numbers. Some single stocks keep on trucking when those funds are down.

1852 2018-05-01 03:14:13 ppl get so caught up in fundies but what do fundamentals matter when chart speaks for itself.. stocks dont go straight down forever.. so $FUSZ being sooo oversold creates a pattern known as first green day, plus multi-week breakout in 3's looming... statistics make money imo

1858 2018-05-01 03:06:20 17's a strong return for 2017, should always have a significant portion of investments in Mutual Funds.

I rebalance it every 2 years
1859 2018-05-01 03:06:13 Dave doesn’t invest in any single stocks.
1860 2018-05-01 03:05:56 Health ins goes up every year, interest because the economy is stronger, stocks always cycle, and oil is adjusting to production levels and demand. Why the surprise. These things were predictable.
1861 2018-05-01 03:05:12 Isn’t he about getting your personal finances and spending under control and then saving? I doubt he would be in on putting money in personal stocks. I think it takes a well balance.
1862 2018-05-01 03:04:24 Using your reasoning (that foreign ownership of USA stocks is a bad thing), are you then supportive of closing the borders to keep foreign nationals out? If not, why not?
1863 2018-05-01 03:02:25 They just want to shill their worthless stocks. 
1864 2018-05-01 03:02:13 Bonds are still probably your safest bet. If the US government defaults, your 401k might be the least of your problems.

In any way, companies like WalMart are the safest bet among stocks. WM is doing OK even in crisis.

1921 2018-05-01 02:08:03 Watch the Secario 2 trailer.  Benicio Del Toro bimpfires a pistol with 1 finger.  Its physics.   Bump stocks are a gimmick.  No serious shooter considers them.  But it's the nebulous language of "rate increasing device"  that troubles many.  Too much room for Gov overreach

1933 2018-05-01 01:52:51 any ar-15 that was used wasn’t an ar-15 (they were all modified) as with the obama approved bump stocks as one example. the base ar-15 is a single shot rifle. maybe learn a little more. BTW-read the 1968 Gun Control Act-all you want is in there.  BTW guns don’t kill, people do.
1934 2018-05-01 01:52:15 Sir Thanks a lot for sharing your thoughts on the market now. Your perception about the stocks and the market in general is something that everyone should learn. Insights every time when we see you talk.

1939 2018-05-01 01:46:22 Not as bad as cars. More people are killed by cars per year than guns. Hands an feet or hammer or baseball bat's kill more people per year than your misnomered 'military grade weapons', bump stocks and extended magazines.

1947 2018-05-01 01:34:33 The good news is my CNR stocks are through the roof
1948 2018-05-01 01:34:21 Okay, thanks for responding. So what do the stocks represent? How are they valued? They're not based on gold, so what are they based on? I've researched this question some, but the answers are vague. Thanks.
1949 2018-05-01 01:33:46 Stocks are also okay. I use stocks all the time. But some of y’all just browse through tumblr saving everything lol.

1952 2018-05-01 01:30:13 That's amazing I'm currently looking into ways to create a passive income. I currently don't have a position on any dividend paying stocks so I'm looking to dip my toes so to speak.

The Dow's first print was 40.94 on May 26, 1886. In 1932, it hit a low of 41.22.

1957 2018-05-01 01:26:16 Lol I’m sure I could show you a list of sub-penny stocks a hundred times longer than that with bigger gains but I don’t play anything worth less than a penny because there is a reason it’s under a penny.
1958 2018-05-01 01:25:18 Yup! Understanding price action and holding through healthy pullbacks is key to successful trading either options or stocks. I'm up 2000%+ on $AXXA and 1000%+ on $BRKK in 3 weeks because of it.

1971 2018-05-01 01:13:58 You're an unreachable ideologue. It makes a real difference that we aren't put in the stocks or hung for cutting down trees anymore or that the murder rate is 1/100th what it was. These things have manifest impacts on human wellbeing. Studying why this happened is worth it.

1978 2018-05-01 01:02:33 I was supposed to sell some of my stocks to get money just before the trading closed yesterday... It didn’t happen so I guess that’s a sign not to push thru with the sale.
1979 2018-05-01 01:01:22 I hate how manipulative kpoppies are. How they keep accusing BH of sajaegi when SM literally has stocks in iRiver and BH only hires them as distributor, but i bet if SM says they have 4M eggo preorders next month everybody will find it normal.

1984 2018-05-01 00:52:31 Right, but my friend inherited his stocks and they are in a trust. He can't change it. His mother wanted to protect him, so she set it up. Until recently, these stocks always stayed steady.

1989 2018-05-01 00:45:06 Stock explanation given, 401k accounts are usually funds that contain a mix of stocks to mitigate potential losses. Investing is very different than individual stocks where it's easier to lose money. So bad investing isn't as big a factor except in funds types.
1990 2018-05-01 00:43:52 European stocks rose on Monday  as investors digested M&A action and corporate earnings reports.

2002 2018-05-01 00:26:21 It's almost as if giving the public military grade weapons, bump stocks, pallet loads of ammo, and extended magazines was a bad decision.
2003 2018-05-01 00:24:30 But I will likely never earn more than $150k unless I invest heavily into successful stocks, get lucky, and/or start a business. That's how it is for the majority of people, and, frankly, not everyone can be a streamer for a variety of reasons.

2015 2018-05-01 00:13:35 No, interest rates go up to combat inflation. Inflation increases due to large government debt ($3 trillion) and trade tariffs, making everything more expensive, hence inflation. Very little going to workers, most companies buying back stocks. Next is a recession and layoffs.
2016 2018-05-01 00:13:24 Most Americans aren't directly benefited by rising stocks, only the top few, like Jeff Bezos.
2017 2018-05-01 00:11:37 No. I do not. I support concealed carry. I support your right to own firearms. I want universal background checks, no bump stocks, no large magazines, and heavy restrictions on anything that could be used as an assault weapon.
2018 2018-05-01 00:11:35 While I agree with you stocks have other features such as dividends and voting rights (not all but some do)
