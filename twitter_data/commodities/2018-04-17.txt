35 2018-04-17 20:59:39 Yes the primary effect is to inflate stock and commodities markets, at the expense of goods and service markets
36 2018-04-17 20:48:17 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”

45 2018-04-17 19:33:42 S'what Aaah call Dark Irony in that food stamps were invented as a farm subsidy as much as a social safety net. It was "tariff-proof" commodities. Sugar lobby scewed it, but otherwise today's SNAP (pre-Trump-gutting) is highly nutritious, farmers mkts, seeds, fresh or canned food
46 2018-04-17 19:30:54 Thanks but we’re not commodities

50 2018-04-17 19:11:32 Why is it unacceptable? Just because you live in the wealthiest society doesn't mean you can't rack up massive bills from spending on commodities or not make any money because you don't work.
51 2018-04-17 19:03:54 i've read about two dozen articles about the housing crisis this week alone. if we believe in #dayton260k, we need to make dayton the city that figured out that cities need people and people need shelter first, investment commodities a distant second. make housing happen!

55 2018-04-17 18:23:41 Very soon, the prices of commodities will be twice what they are now and we still won’t be able to do anything.
56 2018-04-17 18:20:34 It's a solid Q1 earnings report by $GS but I think investors are still concerned with the underperformance of the bank's FICC (Fixed-income, commodities and currencies) business. Bond trading hasn't been strong.
57 2018-04-17 18:20:19 Dogs should be controlled but sending sheep to slaughter in a ritualistic medieval way is awful too. Don’t pretend you’re concerned about welfare of animals you see as commodities and not sentient beings.
58 2018-04-17 18:15:14 They do that everywhere. Even if they need a reason, they make one up. Ppl are commodities to the depraved ones.
59 2018-04-17 18:08:48 A economia brasileira ainda não entrou no século XXI. Ainda pensamos que às únicas riquezas são as velhas commodities do século passado. Precisamos nos preparar para os empregos do terceiro milênio. Só assim teremos um crescimento sustentável e de longo prazo.

69 2018-04-17 17:22:33 Meanwhile, some commodities where amazing shorts over the past 5 to 6 years.
70 2018-04-17 17:13:14 Yes I believe they have overplayed their hand. But I suspect that they see low commodities prices as their best chance of getting elected or reelected. They may even be secretly rooting for that to happen.
71 2018-04-17 17:06:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
72 2018-04-17 17:03:54 I don't disagree with the premise that we should aim higher given the commodities we've now got, but predominantly as a baseline, and a slight upgrade on what we have in order to get us established again, I'd have no qualms about it. From what I've seen, he'd make a contribution.
73 2018-04-17 17:00:26 World commodities are traded in dollars as dollar is world’s currency. Euro is only used 19 european countries inc Slovenia, Slovakia, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta & so on. North American continent, SA continent, Asia, Russia, Middle East, Oceania use dollars.
74 2018-04-17 16:58:27 I think commodities chop for awhile. Too many people interested and China purposefully slowing. Infrastructure and One Belt policy balances it out. Rangebound. Its probably all about the dollar at this point. If dollar goes lower commodities go higher, thats the cue
75 2018-04-17 16:57:46 Dear , @AbdiwaliGas you said there is huge bilateral trade between #Somalia and #UAE , most commodities import from Asia & Turkey directly via containers that eliminated Emirates brokers  .
@Puntland_State @M_Farmaajo @SomaliPM
76 2018-04-17 16:54:36 S-D model is used to determine prices of commodities and services. Communist societies ideally don't need prices since basic and commodities are provided for by the state. Always limiting yourself to economics?

78 2018-04-17 16:47:52 The biggest cost to refiners is the cost of oil, it's a commodity going in and commodities going out, there is no price differentiator for the feed stock or the refined product that allows enough margin to finance the capex required to build new capacity in small markets.

104 2018-04-17 15:03:55 Yes exactly. It was based on capitalism which commodified human labour, property rights were enshrined by law and so the slaves were viewed as commodities and not human beings, which was a big step away from previous forms of slavery.
105 2018-04-17 15:02:25 Trying a silver short at 1674.2, seems high compared to gold and other commodities today. Not a huge position and guaranteed stop in place - wouldn’t want to see it go much higher than 1690 area
106 2018-04-17 15:02:06 I think the AAA games developers are gun-shy, and maybe for good reason. Big games and blockbuster movies are expensive to make. Innovation, creativity and originality are scary, because you might fail. Proven commodities, on the other hand...

108 2018-04-17 15:00:28 I mostly ignore yields because I don't trade bonds. It's also why I mostly ignore currencies and commodities. Nothing tells me how equity markets are trading/will trade than equity markets.
109 2018-04-17 14:57:07 Returning to Gold(&Silvr?)Std commodities will pray to God lessen conflicts around the globe;perhaps initially a little slowdown of world economy as conversions-adjustments occur but slower maybe more manageable socioeconomically for country leaders&pray inequality is minimized.
110 2018-04-17 14:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
111 2018-04-17 14:32:43 @ZimTradeAlerts: Zim to export value added products & not commodities, high demand in China for horticulture in citrus & macadamia nuts.
112 2018-04-17 14:20:39 Why are we surprised when wages were below the 1998 high until 2017? Learned to adjust to deflation. We are still in a deflationary environment. Commodities go up & down. Once you raise wages... it’s forever.

124 2018-04-17 13:17:00 .@HafezGhanem1: How does fiscal transparency affect renewing the social contract in the region? 
There are not enough resources for governments to keep subsidizing commodities and that is inefficient.
125 2018-04-17 13:01:56 I often think that China allows Imports of commodities to force the domestic price down to international levels. Chinese enterprises are notoriously inefficient.

140 2018-04-17 12:05:09 GRRM is pretty good at describing how this feudal system turns noble women into commodities robbed of any sense of agency (and the fate of lowborn women are not better). But I can't say anything more lest I spoil the rest.

Likewise, these managers likely did not lose money relative to their respective benchmarks (in bonds, commodities, FX, etc.) and so got paid. The poor performance is 100% due to poor asset allocation on Harvard's part.

232 2018-04-17 01:02:20 DDS Bloggers are milking the issue on LP's Holocaust Memorial photo to the bone. Great effort you guys!

How about talking about the ever increasing prices of basic commodities now?
233 2018-04-17 01:02:01 I’m pretty sure that punitive taxes on specific products, industries or commodities, Pigouvian or otherwise, are the opposite of what a free market is. Rather, it seems fascist, crony, and distortionary in nature
234 2018-04-17 00:56:13 In the last decades many Latin American countries grew a lot (lacking data on efficiency), and reduced inequality. Of course they have slowed down like Brazil+Argentina,but I don't think that is due to inequality policies but rather to adverse petrol / commodities price.
235 2018-04-17 00:50:58 I was red-pilled by the continuous and ongoing manipulation of the financial and commodities markets, and the banking system. Once I realized it was all fake, everything Geo-politically fell into place.
236 2018-04-17 00:49:19 Commodities, in particular grains, I like end of year or 2019 for a multi-year play...fwiw
237 2018-04-17 00:48:01 Brengle, who has won more than $2.1m in prize money, said: "I am bringing this action in an effort to force those who control the sport I love to understand that players are not commodities and should be treated with respect and dignity.

240 2018-04-17 00:35:17 And with such a huge percentage of humanity working in gig/freelance/1099/etc economies, we’re losing the clout that unions and hiring halls once gave us. I would love to upend the dynamic that treats us as commodities, not skilled professionals.

243 2018-04-17 00:13:46 i mean if you want to go at least partially towards a more just society, maybe the fucking human necessities you learn about in grade school could just not be turned into speculative commodities. Fuck
244 2018-04-17 00:05:04 Sorry. I'm late to this. This bloke is clueless. My business partner's from Cali and her brother is a commodities broker specialising in rare metals. They are desperate to secure a better EU trade deal. Zero interest in separate UK deal. People on the ground. FACT.
