36 2018-07-23 23:56:31 @Crypto_Macro any thoughts on sustainability of recent BTC rally? On top of people foolishly betting on ETF approval, isn't this mostly people just selling their alts and moving into BTC? No new money = Another BTC dump soon?
37 2018-07-23 23:56:27 My insider info says September of 18
38 2018-07-23 23:56:27 I'm am balls deep in 100% shitcoins. Dying inside currently.
39 2018-07-23 23:56:27 I have adjusted it to low 5k range. The bullish signals I am now seeing make more sense at that level.

61 2018-07-23 23:53:12 Crypto twitter feed full of people declaring the market has finally realised alts are worthless is a pretty good indicator alts and eth are going to bounce -hard- sometime in the next week or two.
62 2018-07-23 23:53:07 The Cardano takeover that's coming
63 2018-07-23 23:53:05 Long term is the key IMO

65 2018-07-23 23:52:49 Will bitclave ever go up?
66 2018-07-23 23:52:44 And refunds would be a mess. I don't think we are quite there yet for major retailers to accept Crypto
67 2018-07-23 23:52:44 With the anonymity crypto gives, we can bring back tontines without the risk of being bumped off.
68 2018-07-23 23:52:41 alts moving forward
69 2018-07-23 23:52:40 yo Nick, im hearing 6850-6600 for the pullback.
the eliiott wave guys have both scenarios after that; we drop 2 waves down to all new lows, or the following bounce up sends the price to 10k.
They like to cover both outcomes.
Is your low target still in the 4500 range?

79 2018-07-23 23:51:49 make some outlandish statement like McAfee 
80 2018-07-23 23:51:47 BC @senorLupe is nice and cares very much for his horses.  I'd buy the man a beer as he entertains me with his overwhelming positiveness.
81 2018-07-23 23:51:41 Wanna know something else?the $ value of crypto is irrelevant. Fiat has no place in the crypto space. All that matters is how much btc eth is worth and btc is 1. Those who speak in fiat with in the crypto space have lost site of the purpose of crypto. circumventing fiat and banks
82 2018-07-23 23:51:38 $BNT $NPXS $NCASH
83 2018-07-23 23:51:26 I believe its too many unknowns for @amazon to accept crypto. They probably want price stability. It would take a lot for there site to constant update the cost of items based on the constant fluctuations of Bitcoin
84 2018-07-23 23:51:12 There are no cryptocurrency topics I would like to hear as I’ve kissed a girl.
85 2018-07-23 23:50:57 You missed $btc when satoshi invented #bitcoin

93 2018-07-23 23:49:54 Tomorrow we will be live @ 2 PM PT with @crypto_bobby. Let me know if there any cryptocurrency topics you would like to hear us cover.
94 2018-07-23 23:49:46 Hi I could not log into my account at Superbloom.  Emailed your staff but no reply so far.  Could somebody from your team help with it?  Have funds locked in the account.

107 2018-07-23 23:46:15 そしてこっちがモナコイン。ちょっとクセがあるが、送金に時間がかからない。基本的に東の国で頻繁に使われているが、社会実験の雰囲気が強く、商人の間ではそれほど普及していないんだ。この通貨でしか実質買えないものも存在するので、少し持っておくと安心できるぞ。
108 2018-07-23 23:46:12 When will the tokens be listed on an exchange?

110 2018-07-23 23:45:56 Idk, I've seen way too many shitcoins with teams who have a cartoon picture & web name, & they definitely do not inspire trust for crypto investors! Most shitcoins tank because of anonymous founders. 

I think Satoshi is the only one who can do it, the rest have to prove identity

127 2018-07-23 23:42:43 Generally, after ICO's are done, the new companies will convert all of the raised money into FIAT to maintain a stable value.

This far into 2018, ICO's have raised $6.3 BILLION , which means roughly that much crypto has been market dumped for fiat.
128 2018-07-23 23:42:29 Always loving Linda. There will be a lot of happy people soon and a lot of people wanting to rage quit crypto that sold because of weak hands.
129 2018-07-23 23:42:06 A easy way to tell who the crypto OGs are, and who has been around for less than a year is to see who is playing FOMO3D....simply a Ponzi and your going to lose your money... Crypto OGs have seen this many times before and know exactly what's going to happen

134 2018-07-23 23:41:20 But at the end of the day there is no creation of money from air (yeah, I know, duh). To be clear, somebody obviously is going to loose money (sume cero game)
135 2018-07-23 23:41:13 this guy is a crypto-Nazi like his father.
136 2018-07-23 23:41:11 It was heckling brother 
Hence my reaction...I'm not a dick and don't hate on any other projects at all, the sooner this stupid stuff stops happening the better for crypto as a whole

143 2018-07-23 23:40:18 My favorite thing about crypto twitter is scrolling through my timeline and seeing a funny tweet from a big account, liking it, and then scrolling some more and seeing the same exact tweet from another big account.

Come on folks, originality. It’s not that hard.

145 2018-07-23 23:39:48 I hope so!
146 2018-07-23 23:39:39 A lot of the neuroticism in Bitcoin is caused by people with 'life changing' amounts of crypto, or a perception of 'life changing' amounts in crypto. But I think that this risk doesnt (generally) make for the most coherent leadership comprehension. We should be more wary of this.
147 2018-07-23 23:39:38 interesting, we shall see
148 2018-07-23 23:39:30 I bought dip on btc at 12k and 8k. Then bought the $trac dip at $0.17 cents.... short term I'm #rekt long term I'm #itoldyousomotherfuckers
149 2018-07-23 23:39:14 Stop hit on $WAN, will look to buy back later on. No idea if bottom is close on so playing it safe. $POE and $TRX are close to their stops too

158 2018-07-23 23:38:28 I don’t see any floating around and I honestly don’t see it happening.. the Obike pull out in Singapore added negative value as a partner with the cobranding .. Grab doesn’t seem to be growing in relationship with @OdysseyOCN ..its stale..Yi needs to move before being surpassed.

165 2018-07-23 23:36:25 That article is a little misleading. Koreans are in to crypto mostly because they are inherent gamblers, less so because of tech. Yet back when Bitcoin peaked at $20,000, Koreans were paying $29,000 per BTC, whereas now there is no premium, meaning demand is down.

173 2018-07-23 23:34:39 hello @Scrollnate A buddy from my crypto group introduced me to scroll and I really enjoyed your periscope.  What did you mean when you said Tron was very Ethereum based? Will Scroll token only be able to be purchased with Cryptos like ETH... and TRX maybe in the future?

178 2018-07-23 23:32:40 This is happening to a lot of people in the crypto community. Underpaid outsourcers with no passion probably just push the button on everything reported with the same photo
179 2018-07-23 23:32:33 It’s Apple that is the wait for approval on IOS I’m pretty sure...if it drops more I’ll be buying allot more.

190 2018-07-23 23:31:00 A lot of alts a down because of the rise of BTC.but I still do think this coin should be sitting at a stable .03 and not a sub penny . When you look at the circ supply and releases OCN has had its a ridiculous price.not much more for them to release at this point.need partners
191 2018-07-23 23:30:17 Sorry couldn't get past the stash!!! But ill buy it anyway lol.

225 2018-07-23 23:21:39 would it piss you off, if you know a Crypto Specific HF manager, that just got HUGE $$$ to invest, from a Major player, and they say things that are NOT FACTUAL and they kinda CLUELESS.

234 2018-07-23 23:20:13 Reasons I'm against massive #Airdrops during #ICO periods.
1) It shows that projects don't respect their own coin
2) It shows that projects don't respect their actual investors.
3) It shows that projects don't really care about opening price in exchanges

246 2018-07-23 23:18:26 If you're staring at the $BTC chart (or any chart) and have a bullish bias (crypto usually does on $BTC), ask yourself: if you flipped the chart upside down, would you think it (USD) was bullish? If so, you're now bearish on $BTC.

Always question your bias.

255 2018-07-23 23:16:28 So a guy I know could’ve made a profit of 18 crores off crypto currency but got greedy in case the price went further up. The price dropped immensely. Lalach buri bala hai.... but 18 fuckinh crores man.
256 2018-07-23 23:16:14 そしてこっちがイーサリアムだ。色々と融通が効くので大切に使っていきたい通貨だな。このお金は燃やすことによって様々な契約を行える。この時間になったら送金できるようにするとか、他の通貨での支払いをトンネルするみたいなこともできるぞ。ビットコインについで人気が高い、良い通貨だ。

265 2018-07-23 23:13:22 And I’m angry!!! The next crypto-conservatives that dare to say climate change is not real, not man-made and yadda yadda yadda had better get ready to eat back their own shit, cos I’ll personally see to it! They made the wrong choices, and we ALL have to deal with the results

284 2018-07-23 23:09:17 Investing in #crypto was a gamble for me until I learned how revolutionary #blockchain technology was. 

2 years ago I didn't know what was Bitcoin and Today my personal restaurant in Greece accepts $btc. #BTC has changed my life. 

Thank you Satoshi 
285 2018-07-23 23:09:08 The fact that a good number of #crypto enthusiasts entire investment thesis around @bitcoin revolves around the chances of an #ETF getting approved says a lot...

288 2018-07-23 23:08:29 I think this is true for genuine asset-based markets like stocks. Not true at all for currencies. Commodities - perhaps weakly so. Right now, I put crypto in the commodities category.

If I have too be near someone to trade with them, why would I drop it on the ground and hope they get it.

305 2018-07-23 23:03:41 Only thing I can think of is that there’s a lot of mainstream shillers that have been telling folks that alts will go to zero. Evidently there’s enough blind followers for it to become manifest destiny

321 2018-07-23 23:00:45 I feel as if I haven’t accomplished anything on crypto twitter until bots start saying I’m giving away free ETH
322 2018-07-23 23:00:32 That would be great for crypto to finally rid itself of this Tether mess. But it won’t be happening any time soon because far too many people are cashing in on it.
323 2018-07-23 23:00:21 I think @Arclegger would agree, just buy some crypto XD

325 2018-07-23 23:00:16 Stop giving it away. If people want crypto , they can get off their asses to buy some like the rest of us. 

Coming from a guy who used to do giveaways.  I’ve learned my lesson. Stop giving ur wealth away (unless you actually make money doing it ).

Instead of baiting the 90% of idiot fanboy in the crypto community, if you wanna have an interesting and constructive discussion you might want to talk with him. Even if you disagree, it would be a great talk imo.
401 2018-07-23 22:48:02 Any TP targets?
402 2018-07-23 22:47:59 gogo!

404 2018-07-23 22:47:22 Ledger swap details coming out in August apparently. Official wallet swap details are either out already or not far off.
405 2018-07-23 22:47:11 Interested
406 2018-07-23 22:47:10 So what happens to alts when $btc decides to go back down and retest the bottom support of this descending triangle? If Jan. was the bubble popping most of the alts will die. Don’t chase pumps. Takes profits. I want a full on alt season, but I’m keeping my expectations low.
407 2018-07-23 22:46:37 I agree, but there's no denying @brockpierce has the Midas touch.

I'm sure they'll be voted in for a community benefit app and can plan to figure all the authentic/ non-tech qualitative stuff after they secure the first $100 Million.
408 2018-07-23 22:46:14 Yeah maybe, you need a lot of luck in this game. For example I started with Tom Liberatore. I started with Danger instead of someone like Macrae etc. I'm happy with my Jack Riewoldt pick, if you take out the week he was concussed and the week after he's been really consistent.
409 2018-07-23 22:46:09 We have been reading similar statements since $5 the reason why this does not go up is clear it is being shorted knowing there will always been shares for them to cover via dilution. Every other crypto stock is bouncing here except this one DILUTION
410 2018-07-23 22:46:08 I hate that POF is now sending me emails telling me I need to setup security question for account recovery purposes.  Can someone tell POF it's just a POF account not money or crypto. We can just make a new one without losing a step.
411 2018-07-23 22:46:07 まずこの国の基軸通貨、ビットコインだな。仮想通貨という概念を最初に提示した始祖の通貨だ。基本的にこのお金を使って他の通貨と交換することになるから、これからずっとお世話になるぞ。

421 2018-07-23 22:44:23 Wow opens your eyes. We know so much about crypto & are so involved, guess we get complacent. We dont realize how little the public knows. People tend to battle against other crypto communities with facts, but the real goal is to get those facts to the public.

492 2018-07-23 22:31:41 My Top Secret Crypto security clearance was terminated when I left active duty, but I was still subject to adherence to non-disclosure requirements applying to all classified material. Same probably applies to former officials.

540 2018-07-23 22:23:48 I am open to opinions that differ from mine. That is why I follow people I don’t agree with. See these are things you don’t understand because like I’ve said before... you’re a child. Now go to bed before I call mommy she won’t be happy you’re up past your bedtime bucko

CBOE Open Interest; is used to gauge liquidity and help judge sentiment / confirm trends for Long/Shorts positions on BTC futures contracts. Open interest @ $4,416 means interest drop from week ago @ $5,367
548 2018-07-23 22:22:11 yes, but soon bitcoin bullish
549 2018-07-23 22:22:11 Okay :-) I‘m just in the process of replacing FourQ/SIDH field arith with fiat-crypto’s synthesized code for formal verification and snowshoe uses the same fast mul trick for 2^127-1 as snowshoe, and there are some issues :-)

561 2018-07-23 22:20:15 Can I add The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand? Too many books lol and these are just fiction. I get carried away with lists and want to organise into fiction sub categories now  But then I’d lose months of my life. And then I’d just have to move onto non fiction 
562 2018-07-23 22:20:10 What about dismissing the advice of academic cryptographers after they break the home rolled hash function you wrote for the 9th biggest crypto currency on earth?
563 2018-07-23 22:20:09 Many TBC Members seem to be concerned about their incentive to share TBC and their reward to recruit new members into THEBILLIONCOIN community.

564 2018-07-23 22:20:01 Because when you grow up you learn a lot. You’re still in your immature little world. You don’t understand confirmation biases and learning outside your box.

581 2018-07-23 22:17:16 Imagine buying bitcoin a year ago and being up 180% on an asset that has influenced banks and businesses around the world. Also Facebook banned crypto ads a long time ago, apparently just recently allowed ads for new ICO’s

587 2018-07-23 22:16:50 You are right. Who buys bitcoin at these prices?

589 2018-07-23 22:16:41 Yep, had Shaw all year. Still have 14 players from my original team. Big win was starting Lloyd at D2 & been pretty happy with Stef Martin.

591 2018-07-23 22:16:27 Price is so low, time to accumulate
592 2018-07-23 22:16:22 Jeff, I just called Mr. Hand and told him that you need to retake his class since you cannot infer from the article. Or you are being super anal and asking for an actually step by step transactional account of how crypto took off in Korea, which would expose you as a fake Spicoli
593 2018-07-23 22:16:15 What a Text, just 5 words. Buy now or Cry later.
594 2018-07-23 22:16:11 Why bad? If it was refunded in fiat how would it be possible? By selling $BTC = 100% dump.
595 2018-07-23 22:16:00 And you don’t offer any good insight... you don’t offer shit. You still one fucking coin harder than any shiller to ever shill Lol Ur a fucking joke kid.

602 2018-07-23 22:13:35 Why does it have to be a zero sum game? Why can't we have different secure options? Nickels, dimes and pennies...each crypto has a satoshi (not BTC) value for a reason.
603 2018-07-23 22:13:29 I have a bag stored in a wallet long time back :)
604 2018-07-23 22:13:28 Never that.  I’ve been on her feed for a few months and have read so many positive things that I choose to believe she didn’t know.  If I’m wrong, then I’d be surprised but I still wouldn’t automatically assume the worst.
605 2018-07-23 22:13:10 I agree, I used to day trade and I could pick the best set up in the world and then some fkin news or sommat would wipe out my position. Often by like 1 point like they purposely moved the market “just” behind the last point or S&R. There was money, but also a lot of frustration
606 2018-07-23 22:12:59 I’ve also sold all my dodgy bags (some at 90% loses) and bought a focused and controllable set of stellar alts banging to ping.

615 2018-07-23 22:11:20 2020 to 2024 is the year Bitcoin will reach equilibrium, and if that is 250k or 500k or 1M I dont know. But im guessing closer to 1M, because then a 100% increase is to 2M. It might take 3-4 years from 2024 to 2028 to go from 1M to 2M, thats only a 25% each year = equilibrium.

618 2018-07-23 22:10:56 I am stunned by the amont of time he spend bashing something with a Market cap that is neglectable in comparison to Gold which is his main goal. If you move all money from Crypto to Gold , nothing happens. Perhaps he is afraid the opposite might happen.

644 2018-07-23 22:06:21 I never actually followed them for the same reason, I’ll happily trade BCH but disagree with the way they advertise. However all of their posts are full of hatred, some of the stuff makes me , but I don’t want it taking up my time.
645 2018-07-23 22:06:20 Crypto is not that big yet. Its still pretty easy to speak to  developers, good traders, CEOs and exchange owners.All you have to do is  ask around and not be a dick.

678 2018-07-23 22:01:05 at this point i think its only inevitable for a platform to emerge where you can bet on individuals. we might already be there with crypto. muskcoin, zuckercoin. bezoscoin. i can already see how dangerous that is but that doesn’t make it any less inevitable.
679 2018-07-23 22:01:03 For sure
680 2018-07-23 22:00:57 
681 2018-07-23 22:00:49 It’s all about volume required to move the markets. Which is why when money flows out of BTC into alts you’ll see huge gains
682 2018-07-23 22:00:28 Crypto is a bet against the modern macroeconomic dogma, which is passed off as science, but is really a branch of politics - with rulers, winners, and losers. - @naval #quote #blockchain #cryptocurrency #strategy
683 2018-07-23 22:00:27 No one's twitter handle could move the price of btc. Maybe if @AngeloBTC came out right now and said he was selling everything he owned to buy btc, maybe. but I doubt it. not for any extended period of time.
684 2018-07-23 22:00:19 @GodR1KO Happy bday bro!

687 2018-07-23 22:00:00 make some crypto coin patterns please! and also i´d love to see you offer your product on the @safe_exchange marketplace in a couple of months.

724 2018-07-23 21:54:33 Great stuff by Brian. I think another answer to Melissa's question could be something I heard from Carter Thomas @carterthomas :
While the price of BTC and Crypto has been down for months,  the INNOVATION in the industry has been massive. THAT was and IS a great sign.

That's not condemnation of all muslims, obviously not all of them support it but there are areas where they do and poll results reflect it.

762 2018-07-23 21:47:39 It's going to be the bridge for business to blockchain. I believe in #DRGN more than any other crypto / Blockchain company.

765 2018-07-23 21:47:28 Yeah mum! You'll never convince crypto that children are still defined as living things after birth or that life exists outside of the womb.

Don't you know that life is explicity defined as only occurring in the womb? 

It really was a "good try," but crypto is logic-proof.

Litecoin is a top shelf blue chip crypto asset. It’s a blazing fast lightning network and does transactions in seconds. It’s secure because a genius named Charlie Lee designed from the ground up. Expect this coin to go up at least 80% from current prices.

951 2018-07-23 21:17:18 "The Crypto Show" was (maybe still is) sponsored by Dash, they always used to play a jingle about it halfway through.
952 2018-07-23 21:17:07 Ok.. so the issue is that Li Xiaolai is the manager of these funds, but he is also a big investor in EOS. This is the shadiness of big investors forming EOS, with a shady inventor... then calling out Tron as the scam, while EOS is listed as a top crypto in China and TRX is not??

Çok hareketli günler yaşanacak çok...
961 2018-07-23 21:16:12 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。
962 2018-07-23 21:16:00 1. Why would a CEO talk to you about this if it was true? What does their project gain from talking to you?
2. Anyone could claim similar things, like ah CEO told us this or that, but said no screenshot, sorry. You'll just have too trust this.
963 2018-07-23 21:15:50 Agreed and the ETF will not influence until it's implemented by the companies which is 6 mos to a year...

970 2018-07-23 21:15:09 One of these I can recapitulate in vitro. I guess Crypto may struggle to guess which one.
971 2018-07-23 21:15:03 Pretty high, institutional investors will look for anything to give them a return on investment!

985 2018-07-23 21:12:28 One thing I really dislike about #LedgerNanoS is that the number of apps (each crypto requires one) you can install is limited by storage. Previously I could have 6 cryptos in my Ledger, but now with Live, I can only have 5 so I had to sell all of my $XRP.

992 2018-07-23 21:10:58 Crypto-currency & blockchain tech is the future. BTC is alpha stage of this dev. Not even in beta, yet. BTC is one step to moving towards proper crypto-currency.

1092 2018-07-23 20:56:58 Bc marriage is a social contract, it has nothing to do with passion. You should marry bc you want to start a family or bc you want to start a life with someone. If it makes sense. You can love someone without being married and you can be married without being in love

1095 2018-07-23 20:56:41 The higher #Bitcoin goes in price, the bigger the #Alt season we'll have. $BTC is how we get more investors and insititual money into Crypto. Not to mention you get the opportunity to buy some #Alt coins at incredible prices.

1098 2018-07-23 20:56:05 They don't operate on Sundays. They will dump by this Friday though for sure. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I meant that contract has to be a short which opened at 9.5k therefore it's most likely to dump before close. Unlikely that the contract was a long

1109 2018-07-23 20:54:34 wrong. If VCs authentically believed, they'd raise a crypto fund as you've seen many do. Public securities are "free" for everyone to access and there are still plenty of hedge funds. Many VCs don't like crypto because there are still plenty of things to dislike about it.

1120 2018-07-23 20:52:24 Your decision to invest should always depend on your belief in the value of the entity. Be it stock, real estate, crypto, a company, etc. It’s risky but with proper due diligence—you should be okay. Think long-term. #invest #smartmoney
1121 2018-07-23 20:52:16 Probably next year at some point, anywhere from Q2-Q4, that also goes for other crypto's as well. Hope that answers your question 
1122 2018-07-23 20:51:52 Definitely up or down!  Have no idea, I trade the daily charts or 4 hrs. 5 + 15 min charts are like hitting the slots. Not for me. Alts are where the value is now, not enough upside to interest me in BTC.

1208 2018-07-23 20:38:53 $LTC volume spike. 2080 coin print at $81.90.  $LTCUSD #LTCUSD #LTC #Litecoin #coinbase #gdax
1209 2018-07-23 20:37:56 How much crypto do you own?
1210 2018-07-23 20:37:40 Unlikely this will reach mass adoption.  Takes way too long to collect mostly worthless coins.  No game aspects.  Unless the business starts supporting companies sponsoring drops like PokemonGo did, I feel this business model will fail.
1211 2018-07-23 20:37:26 Much of the ideas in the crypto space are new and thus not understood at first since it's such a radical new architecture. It's radically different from  the dev we're used to. Best we can do is research the direction and market while it's still a pipedream. Augur comes to mind.
1212 2018-07-23 20:37:22 I wrote a similar piece when I was in Seoul back in January. I believe it is 30% of salaried workers that are invested, rather than 30% of all South Koreans. 2018/1/21/south-korea-and-the-crypto-craze
1213 2018-07-23 20:37:17 If all of crypto put the amount of effort the free $ETH scam puts into what they're doing; we would already have mass adoption.
1214 2018-07-23 20:37:14 I don’t know anyone else that knows about crypto besides they’ve “heard” of bitcoin, mass adoption is so far away
1215 2018-07-23 20:37:14 Where does volume in the #bitcoin and #crypto markets come from?

1221 2018-07-23 20:35:48 @coindrop0x and... The votes are in! Thank you to all those who have participated in the poll!

The outcome was somewhat expected, with a few surprising results, but it does give us some valuable insight into the overall consensus.

#Crypto #PharosCap #blockchaintechnology
1222 2018-07-23 20:35:06 ICO's are huge risk with no chart history. That's why I believe < 10% subjective news noise about #Crypto & 90% what I see on an objective chart.
1223 2018-07-23 20:35:06 I never traded before I came to crypto. I still not sure trade here is a good idea, really.

1225 2018-07-23 20:34:41 You should always be open to any possibility and attempt to eliminate bias. That said I don't believe 4-5k is possible ever again. There is just too much new infrastructure being built for crypto.

1230 2018-07-23 20:34:19 OK let talk about the outcome if ETF gets denied. BTC will drop that is like 99.999% prob. What about alts , do you think it will drop with it or it will rally like when Winklevoss ETF was denied March 2017?
1231 2018-07-23 20:33:45 I shall not buy any more $NEBL unless it dips another 20%.  I shall not buy any more #neblio unless it dips another 20%. I shall not buy any more $NEBL unless it dips another 20%...... Get the idea. #bitcoin #crypto

1233 2018-07-23 20:33:02 Early internet investors often say that the majority of failed dotcom ideas actually turned out to be right...just a decade or two early

If the majority of crypto ideas eventually turn out to be right the world will look completely different in a few decades
1234 2018-07-23 20:33:01 @Crypto_Bitlord thoughts? Most moving into $btc are forgetting that a large btc run leads to massive influxes of retail investors looking for cheap coins they can stack which inevitably leads to Altcoins pumping higher.
1235 2018-07-23 20:32:43 Crypto Community is a sick place. I used to be naive and think otherwise but now i see, rat poision squared.
1236 2018-07-23 20:32:41 Had I known about forex during last years bull run in crypto do you know how rich I’d be right now???? For sure 6-figs up...I gotta stop arriving late to these parties man.

1274 2018-07-23 20:25:47 Thanks.  Do you think any impact by Asian crypto traders/market worrying about the weaker dollar with respect to own currencies (e.g., Yuan) from trade war and reallocating?  Macro impact on Crypto would be great news.
1275 2018-07-23 20:25:46 #Winklevoss Capital has become one of the most influential crypto funds, and the brothers have worked tirelessly to persuade regulators to permit the first bitcoin ETF (a task still unfulfilled for now). They also run one of the top digital asset exchanges, #Gemini.
1276 2018-07-23 20:25:29 Nothing wrong with being anonymous, I find it very liberating as opposed to Facebook where I don’t dare talk about crypto and owning some. Dox me if you must it’s a waste of time.

1283 2018-07-23 20:24:54 Could be a good trick to get cheap alts.

1285 2018-07-23 20:24:53 You guys should already know this saying, but I wanted to post it again:

Crypto investor's advice: Buy low, sell lower.
1286 2018-07-23 20:24:39 Chi-Hyung grew his cryptocurrency exchange #UpBit into South Korea’s largest just three months after its launch in Oct. 2017. The platform, held by Song’s Dunamu, handled about $4.7 billion in daily transactions in one of the world’s most important markets for #crypto
1287 2018-07-23 20:24:26 I can’t tell if $OCN is the slowest exit scam in the history of crypto or if it’s just a piece of $hit steadily bleeding to 0
1288 2018-07-23 20:24:06 Yeah but if it pulls back people might rebuy alts since they are most likely cheaper
1289 2018-07-23 20:24:06 
1290 2018-07-23 20:23:40 USD is backed by GDP of U.S and the rest of world who priced in USD, Like the commodities producing countries. Bitcoin is eventually backed by the value of crypto digital economy. without startups of altcoins, BTC is going no where.

1294 2018-07-23 20:23:18 Goes to show your ignorance on the dynamic of the crypto markets. 

Majority of alts can only be traded into BTC. It generally requires fresh capital injections to move BTC price upwards.
1295 2018-07-23 20:23:04 I really hope my crypto portfolio spikes again so I can do something nice for my family

1300 2018-07-23 20:22:27 ありがとうございます。話題が広範囲なのと、ジレンマ認識されてるのが好印象です。モスクワ行けませんが。
1301 2018-07-23 20:22:26 Alts people will console themselves with USD value. Big players have sold their bags to the lil guys, will ride btc then buy whats left at a 90% to 95% discount from January prices. Whales win.
1302 2018-07-23 20:22:04 So that's what he's holding - all makes sense now. 
1303 2018-07-23 20:22:02 Twitter good for multiple follows and interaction. Admin type channels on Telegram good for one way posts, no need to scroll through irrelevant comments by other. Discord can combine both and have multiple channels. Annoying alert sounds though.

1319 2018-07-23 20:19:41 Congratulations! I am not new to trading. There will always be opportunities like these. I didnt get in because if you have a set of rules and you start making exceptions, where do you draw the line? Thats how people get rekt. I have money so missing that doesnt effect me at all.
1320 2018-07-23 20:19:37 Had lunch and a conversation with a crypto day trader yday. Talked about how I struggled with deciding wether to be an #investor or #daytrader. In the past I would become an “investor” when a Day trade wasn’t working out lol. Still struggle with this sometimes. Can anyone relate?
1321 2018-07-23 20:19:33 they're far left when you're a greedy crypto-fascist. it's all relative..

1326 2018-07-23 20:18:22 @VeniceMase @LAIreland No excuse for Hader’s tweets BUT when you’re 17 with a twitter account, you don’t think about being at an All-Star game and having your tweets from H.S. exposed.  Doesn’t make it right, but when you’re 17 you don’t think of the long term consequences

1336 2018-07-23 20:17:04 It fits my thesis that bitcoin is the only crypto that has found something of an application.
1337 2018-07-23 20:16:59 Armstrong is building #Coinbase, the biggest U.S. #Bitcoin exchange, into what his team hopes will become “the Google of #crypto”—as relevant to the next wave of the web as Google was to the last

It's not crypto currency exchange
1342 2018-07-23 20:16:42 Bitcoin's crypto market dominance just hit a new 2018 high.  Looks like existing crypto holders are buying the rumor of a #Bitcoin ETF, and are moving their chips from altcoins to cover their bets.  Since new money is not entering the space, look out below when the news is sold!

1344 2018-07-23 20:16:32 .@Comey You begged #Democrats not the “lose their minds” and go full crypto-commie. Sorry to have to break it to you, Dude, but that ship sailed a long time ago. Now the mask is off. That’s all.

1356 2018-07-23 20:13:53 I like #anon #crypto right now with their placement in the market cap of #Cryptocurrency.
1357 2018-07-23 20:13:39 The world is a better place if slightly skewed by a decent tipple... but if you ask me, it’s not crypto currencies per se but the potential power of blockchain technology that is the thing here #internet2.0

1367 2018-07-23 20:12:19 Same here brother! These are lessons you have to learn in this space.
1368 2018-07-23 20:11:59 Now people selling crypto not bcoz they feeling a pump for #BTC but bcoz they disbelief and waiting for $3000 on #BTC. But now they are selling it to whales at cheaper prices! Later they will buy back it at higher prices!
1369 2018-07-23 20:11:55 me too
1370 2018-07-23 20:11:39 After $BTC, $DCR is probably the most decentralized store of value / crypto commodity. It’s a shame people get focused on CMC rankings instead of actual product / asset development. DCR behaved much better during the recent bear trend as well. Slowly decoupling itself from BTC.
1371 2018-07-23 20:11:10 Same here. Feel bad about keeping quiet about them, but it’s like you say, gotta fill them bags first.

1395 2018-07-23 20:08:01 Best of luck SC.  Anything crypto related will probably correlate with $btc rise in anticipation of SEC ETF decision.  Even without company news $cybx will probably bounce hard soon.  Picked up another 10k near close.
1396 2018-07-23 20:07:37 @DigiByteCoin seems DGB holders love to take DGB toilet dumps when BTC goes up... Love how everyone claims to be HODLing DGB and as soon as BTC goes up, the dumping begins... I guess people love the fiat dollar more than they love crypto...

After a day or two Ether used to rally taking all other altcoins with it to the top.

Hope to see that soon.

1474 2018-07-23 19:51:31 1/ While I really liked @BMBernstein 's piece re: crypto as money, not equities. He is assuming crypto is thought of as money OR equities, but I would argue crypto can be its own unique asset class with TBD valuation techniques and methods. Here's why:
1475 2018-07-23 19:51:25 Even though I think it's a huge turd #shitcoin, $BCH will have its own space in #crypto and I think it will survive. There are, at most ~500 users ?!, and at least double sock puppet accounts, but will grow; as a non-decentralized coin, they have a marketing campaign

1505 2018-07-23 19:44:38 TA for #bitcoin right now is out the window IMO. $BTC right now is reminding me of $EOS going to $21 prior to its mainnet launch. It's inflated due to anticipation. Simply put, if you believe the ETF will get approved then long. If you believe it won't then short. #Crypto

1532 2018-07-23 19:40:35 Maybe it's out of context. It's saying men try to bring women down when they perceive they have an advantage for being women. I see this in crypto all the time, check my last post and the reply to it.

1534 2018-07-23 19:40:30 Knowing a person's name isn't as important as their/teams output & being known to the entire world puts the person in potential danger (if not now then in future depending on price rises).

1539 2018-07-23 19:39:54 The $crypto ICO model is that of the 5,000 $eth scam. Give us your money now & we "promise" to give you more later. Been pretty clear from the start.

1559 2018-07-23 19:37:56 Too much to learn in crypto, graphic design and welding and not enough time. I need to acquire photographic memory.
1560 2018-07-23 19:37:50 Naval is all about pointing fingers and shilling shitcoins. Not building anything remotely noteworthy on bitcoin. He might have money and fund other stuff, not so much in crypto.
1561 2018-07-23 19:37:48 You both are correct. Small scale miners can run the business as described. On scale mining is surely requiring some skilled and experienced engineers to plan a energy efficient facility.

I still believe, that the amount of skilled crypto developers is far smaller then miners.

1599 2018-07-23 19:31:54 @VitalikButerin If crypto is going to succeed, we need to see mass adoption in Africa. It is the perfect proving ground.
1600 2018-07-23 19:31:53 Most important trait in crypto market for investors and traders is resilience right now and aser  focus on product for crypto founders
1601 2018-07-23 19:31:53 I meet a lot of good people in crypto by asking for $6. Please feel free to send me $6.

1609 2018-07-23 19:31:00 Another instance of why #florida isn't a real place. I couldn't live anywhere where things like this go on day after day year after year. I don't pretend my black ass is any safer here, but the mortality rate for people of color in florida is too damn high

1611 2018-07-23 19:30:39 Crypto is an invention by the russian governments trying to dethrone the freemasons of america trapping SEC atm, almost ETF'ing the fugazzi all will go up in thin air as it is only numbers in the air it is not even physical its the greatest scam after WWII's Ubermensch ideology
1612 2018-07-23 19:30:34 What I've noticed a lot on these #BTC moves is that hidden divergences are your very good friend. Especially with all wicks. 

It's easy to miss, so remember when you're looking for regular div. to also look for hidden, which is a clear continuation pattern.

1629 2018-07-23 19:27:58 With #cryptocurrency coming closer to regulated financial world, we’ll see #crypto issuers / exchanges / owners demonstrating they apply the rules & regulations, even better than those #banksters.

1630 2018-07-23 19:27:56 Yes if ID theft is a federal crime & the victim bears ALL fallout not mitigated by banks etc. why don't we hear about the IRS investigating these crimes? Hell @Equifax handed out every social security number of every person monitoring her/his credit!
1631 2018-07-23 19:27:44 Though, I will add to your original comment, it is certainly refreshing to see someone attempt to 'dump' on the bull run in an effort to slow it down and watch it get absorbed.  I agree, we haven't seen that in a long time and it's fun to watch.

1639 2018-07-23 19:26:14 Let's be honest though, most people in crypto twitter are speaking past each other even if they happen to be replying.

The rise of cryptopolitical factions has had a much greater impact on the quality of the discourse than any one person's lack of engagement.
1640 2018-07-23 19:26:07 Also it's now up 2500%

1648 2018-07-23 19:25:17 Is lonely counter trading 90% of Crypto Twitter. I was bullish at 5.8k and have scaled out far too early on this push up to 7.8k, I expected more pullback along the way. Now I fear I am just biased to see signs of a looming dump as it will allow me to re-enter.
1649 2018-07-23 19:25:05 @Sweatcoin I love the concept. However I dont see thus sustainable. Please provide me with a white paper or something that explains everything. After all Transparancy is KEY in Crypto. @Sweatcoin thanks for you're time, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
1650 2018-07-23 19:24:31 Do you see a possibility of $AST @airswap getting listed on coinbase or announcing partnership with @coinbase to run their DEX?

1659 2018-07-23 19:23:14 That's how that exchange is working in general. Delisting a token without any reason or statement, then ban the guys who wanna help others to save these tokens. You are criminals, @hitbtc  It takes time but at some point we will all know. Crypto doesn't need you! $MTC #FTW
1660 2018-07-23 19:23:11 As I have said before, they are afraid. They have amassed both wealth and stardom with their "Expert" status... in fiats.

1661 2018-07-23 19:23:10 Mais bon il faut avoir un CDI hein pour que la demande aboutisse le plus rapidement.le mieux du mieux c'est de faire la demande à 2 avec chacun un CDI...(je sais que c'est plus facile à dire qu'à faire)
1662 2018-07-23 19:22:56 In 2019 we will see mass user adoption brought to you by our corporate overlords. It will be centralized but most of you won't care cause you're just in it for the money. The future of crypto looks like a pepsi commercial.

1735 2018-07-23 19:13:57 from your tweet to the crypto gods ears!!!
1736 2018-07-23 19:13:55 Well thats original
1737 2018-07-23 19:13:55 Open interest is a useful metric if understood correctly
1738 2018-07-23 19:13:53 Do you think #Crypto is fucking awesome?

Old and stubborn refers to people like Warren Buffet who really aren't interested in seeing the world change for the better, but rather keep the status quo. If you prefer banks, vote option 2.

1739 2018-07-23 19:13:51 OMG I never thought of that. It was so hard for me to get into crypto last year because the only onramp I knew of was coinbase, and they wouldn't verify my ID and their crappy support wouldn't help even if I was Bill Gates. Now, the floodgates are open and we are waiting for rain

1743 2018-07-23 19:13:44 Bitcoin up and alts are down. Seems like people are getting back into BTC ahead of possible ETF announcement. Probably isn’t coming until next year or September at the earliest imo.While it isnt good for alts short term, this means we are getting close to the running of the bulls
1744 2018-07-23 19:13:38 Been sitting on that bag for some time now, too much upward potential to ignore, especially with such a focused brand.

1763 2018-07-23 19:11:31 Who knows.  These markets are impossible to figure out.  Many, many, months ago I called my own personal 'bottom' at 11k.  We've been well below that for a long time.  I won't consider any recovery 'real' until we are at least above 10k for a few months.

1850 2018-07-23 19:00:34 In the original SPIFFE paper I used x509 because the implementations are widely supported and it has a track record. The idea was to not invent new crypto but make it easier to distribute and use.
1851 2018-07-23 19:00:25 Every new industry starts out dominated by criminals and clowns, crypto is no different.  (See solar panels, internet startups, aluminum siding.) POW and POS coins are untenable in the long term, leaving the best system, Consensus, to dominate the field.

1936 2018-07-23 18:51:06 It is anticipated that many crypto traders will switch to decentralised exchanges to eliminate security risk and exchanges coins such as $AOA by @Aurora_dao and $SWTH by @SwitcheoNetwork may significantly rise in due course. I am looking to buy few of these coins.

2008 2018-07-23 18:39:28 Actually no, Romano was already working considerably on it on lower prices, under 10k. But around 14k is not a bad support, technically speaking

2021 2018-07-23 18:37:19 Thanks. I guess it was more about how much credibility you would assign to these sources.
2022 2018-07-23 18:37:15 Hey thanks for not insulting me and blocking differing opinions like most on tw. Not necessarily, but it depends on the target market. For example crypto names vary in value given the .org is widely accepted in commerce. But the base standard is .com and likely always will be.

2031 2018-07-23 18:35:56 (1) I have been enjoying #Augur so far.  The platform is clunky, but that will no doubt change in the future.   I am frankly somewhat surprised that the marketplace isn't more active yet.   Only crypto related bets are active, and sports and politics markets are very quiet.
2032 2018-07-23 18:35:50 #ETN242  Electroneum has one of the lowest fees per transaction. This seems good and in facts it is, as its community is strong and massive. It was a joke, but right now it's one of the best choices to cash your crypto out of an exchange. Which is the reason 2 million accept It.

2065 2018-07-23 18:32:30 Please I hope you looked into this matter. My concern is that this app only except Coins/Tokens/Crypto that are approved by leading establishments or exchanges to help shield you from a Coin/Token/Crypto that gets into legal trouble 
2066 2018-07-23 18:32:18 For over a hundred years media messages have enforced that people who look a certain way are bad, while people who look like the american race are not bad.

2151 2018-07-23 18:19:04 The belief that gut instinct isn’t valid as a part of your FA /TA is false. 

Gut instinct/intuition =sub total of subconscious knowledge. 

If you’ve spend a large amount of time in any space.

Your gut instinct is just as valid as any indicators.

2199 2018-07-23 18:12:59 Some of the difficulties to consider are:
- How to identify the investors and stop citizens from certain jurisdictions from participating. Even in a secondary market.

-How to identify where the funds are coming from and who are sending them (difficult with crypto).

2203 2018-07-23 18:12:08 The price will rise with mainstream adoption. The crypto market is not like it was even a year ago. It is saturated with too many projects.

2435 2018-07-23 17:44:43 Tout dépend de nos valeurs et de nos convictions. Un projet qui offre à peu près juste du vent avec une capitalisation si haute ne peut prendre qu'une seule direction.

2436 2018-07-23 17:44:25 Yo @RevolutApp , installed your app the other day, nice work! couple questions tho, what are my default Euro/Sepa transfer limits? when will be able to use Android NFC payments? when will i be able to xsfer my crypto to a personal wallet?
2437 2018-07-23 17:44:25 But my scepticism is about humans, not technology. Crypto enthusiasts talk as if tech will solve the problem that humans are untrustworthy. No it won't. It can't. Code is written by humans.

2466 2018-07-23 17:41:03 No clue & makes no difference to me personally. Project will stilll succeed. All low caps are bleeding right now. It’s just how things work with #crypto market cycles.

2472 2018-07-23 17:40:24 absolutely, it's about to fall a bit... just to regain impulse for the next megabullrun! I see it as near as the 7200-7400 levels, but many others talk about 6800s. Anyhow, retracementes are always a healthy part to growth.

I make that off of Masternodes every few days.

2479 2018-07-23 17:39:49 Half in Masternode coins, half my favorite shitcoins. Might see some additional pullback if the Corn continues it push. I think bottomed out and unpumped new promising projects will pump soon (1-2 months). Worst case is MN’s soften my losses. Feeling risky

2481 2018-07-23 17:39:21 I agree, unless that law is changed it does cause an impediment to using crypto as a currency if you are a U.S. citizen. Which will hinder mass adoption

2509 2018-07-23 17:34:51 Fair. Do you like any crypto currencies other than bitcoin? Tech-wise, innovation-wise, etc.
2510 2018-07-23 17:34:32 The ETFs might have different terms, which may not in some cases hold actual crypto. The SolidX one should, however.
2511 2018-07-23 17:34:01 Haven't checked the precise stats that he pointed out, but it doesn't matter much really, the logic of what I'm saying stays the same. Shitcoins with mid/low cap usually pump and drop faster than btc and eth.

2604 2018-07-23 17:23:40 The core model of a credit agency is to share the costs of non interest-earning elements and bad debts by charging the "good guys" who can pay back the money. For borrowers, it brings an additional cost.

2608 2018-07-23 17:22:44 As always, the only thing that matters long term is FA.
Buying shitcoins like $OCN is good only if you have a tight stop loss and if you're a trader (being a trader =/= thinking you are one).

2633 2018-07-23 17:18:40 Longs were at record highs at the literal top.
Then they broke the record at the correct time for longing in February.
Then they broke the record again before we fell to a bottom in March.
Now, they're going to break again. Maybe they'll close on the next pop up, doubtful though.

2646 2018-07-23 17:17:16 Use to have Nano, lost 50% quickly, changed that to #ZIL and made it all back (cheers @Oly245 !)plus more so I stay away from Nano now. My friend who’s very big into crypto also says Nano is a shit coin. Tbh I don’t understand the full background why

2656 2018-07-23 17:16:35 People betting reputations on if Bitcoin will go to $8k, or $4.8k first.

But, to me, #crypto is binary. 

You either believe it’s going to take over the world, or not.

Short term market swings don’t grab my attention much

What’s in your wallet in 2020? #teamhydro #switchhydro
2657 2018-07-23 17:16:32 It's just a weird psychological thing. Nerds wanna sell out of alts into BTC to catch a bullish move. But really, they're just harming everyone and themselves. Cause, if you don't sell your alt into BTC, you benefit more. But since everyone does it, it hurts to stay. So it moves
2658 2018-07-23 17:16:30 People buying tops and claiming was part of the plan are in denial . And the majority of them have zero prior investment experience . Guys like this monkey leading the pack @davidgokhshtein
2659 2018-07-23 17:16:12 The fact you are suggesting that #vechain are just a supply chain solution shows you have done zero research and know nothing. If you can't be bothered to do proper research into a #crypto then don't try to give an opinion on it.

2666 2018-07-23 17:15:21 Why the push for crypto currency? $ must be backed by gold or something with real value in order to keep it's value. If power cuts out, your wealth and ability to participate in commerce vanishes. Who has their hand on the switch to cut any of us off for any reason?  #QAnon

2714 2018-07-23 17:08:57 @SatoshiLite is correct in saying that even #Litecoin owners should be holding #bitcoin before investing in #Ltc...litecoin moves up faster and down faster, kinda like bitcoin with leverage..I believe in holding both and having a well balanced blockfolio with 5 coins min. #crypto

2716 2018-07-23 17:08:42 Where is this documented? It's not in the readthedocs and I can't see it in any of the top answers when googled. When you've replied, you've never mentioned this. I don't see why this should be documented behaviour, the outcome of a constructor wouldn't change bytecode.

2767 2018-07-23 17:01:40 I will probably end up buying your product in the future. I was just as skeptical about other wallets for months before using them. This is natural in Crypto. I know the reason it can't be organically be "hacked", but that is only half the answer. With tech, I trust but verify.

2852 2018-07-23 16:52:12 Crypto projects are fascinating examples of shared ownership. Imho even more than social sites by now (eg "dont change my facebook feed")
2853 2018-07-23 16:51:55 Feels kind of boring in crypto right now. Which is not necessarily bad. 

Is there a story or narrative you guys find interesting right now?
2854 2018-07-23 16:51:41 Is the #crypto custody issue starting to play a role in the latest uptrend? If #btc is being pulled out of exchanges onto cold wallets, it is more difficult to find #bitcoin to "borrow" in order to short it.

2974 2018-07-23 16:35:57 It's very rational to think that there is possibility that $btc goes to under 5k, especially if you have been in crypto for a few years. Every minute it's smaller, but still a possiblity

3020 2018-07-23 16:29:44 I don't agree. I believe that individuals have the power to cut down manipulation by great amount. Unfortunately in crypto, people see the growth of one coin as the demise of the other, it's all in the hands of people. That is the point of a decentralized structure.

なぜ今ビットコインを推すのかというと、今はbtcが高騰してもアルトは控えめで、btcが下落した場合、アルトも同じ勢いorそれ以上の勢いで↓に行くと思うからです。この理不尽はもう少し継続かと。アルトはアルトのターンを確認してからでも全然遅くなく、充分に取れます！

3141 2018-07-23 16:13:54 Correct me if I'm wrong, but thinking about it, selling any alt into BTC shouldn't affect BTC/USD pair, all it would do is decrease the sats value of the alt? The only reason it would pump BTC price is if those alts had USDT pairings on major exchanges, sell Alt->USDT->BTC,right?

3164 2018-07-23 16:10:19 I think we will see people increasingly hedge with BTC before the ETF event. 

The market cap isn’t growing that rapidly but BTC is, same money circulating from alts to BTC to hedge the decision. Either way should get bloody for alts before it gets better.

3235 2018-07-23 16:01:17 I hopeful for all of us that it will work out.  I recalled you tweeting about goals.  My advice, try to go above your goal 5-10% if you can.  Set a price in which you plan to sell that 5-10% depending on market conditions and move up the stop loss to capture the goal+
3236 2018-07-23 16:01:16 Kesinlikle haklısınız. Piyasaya ilk girdiğimde (tepeden:) "hold bizde Ata sporu" diyenlere uymuştum. Zarar %50 yi geçince kendim araştırmaya başladım. Keşke şuan piyasaya girip, sizi tanınmış olsaydım. Şimdi girenler şanslı bence. Selamlar

3535 2018-07-23 15:26:41 It’s not possible to have a non-plutocratic cryptocurrency system without a way to identify unique humans in the system. If you aren’t willing to accept plutocracy as a necessary evil then I’m puzzled as to your interest in crypto, unless you are an identity system researcher.
3536 2018-07-23 15:26:41 And those that know what they are doing probably got rekt trying at one point.

3597 2018-07-23 15:17:54 And where do they draw the line ?  With such approach - we get back to traditional problem, that is too much power into few self selected hands.  If the defining line is ''being approved by SEC'' and having powerful friends - lobbyists, crypto space will be in deep trouble.

3657 2018-07-23 15:09:39 Here is a tip. Keep your encrypted password manager file in a Dropbox folder and it will automatically update across all devices if you add/change/delete.
3658 2018-07-23 15:09:38 No big deal. The entire crypto echo system is a giant Ponzi scheme.
3659 2018-07-23 15:09:36 yay for speshual!!! you get what I mean about the visualisation of it? I struggle sometimes with some abstract things, but if I can see it or have something I can attach it to it sinks in straight away. GCSE D in Maths but 90% in my MSc crypto paper as had a good visual teacher.
3660 2018-07-23 15:09:24 Buy #DCC now 
3661 2018-07-23 15:09:19 TA guys do care about news and events... lol thats what drives volume
3662 2018-07-23 15:09:08 The crypto market is sooo boring and slow at the moment #xrp #btc
3663 2018-07-23 15:09:07 Well if you keep posting every hour you will be right some day
3664 2018-07-23 15:09:04 Yes, hold your cash, but bitcoin at much higher levels and slide it into Alts right away.  I would subscribe to @CryptoKirby on youtube for the right timing.  Do your own research.  Not investment advice.  Be careful.  Peace!!!!
3665 2018-07-23 15:09:04 ここ踏ん張ればロンガー勢の喜ぶ顔が見れるな。この時間のカレーうまうま。
3666 2018-07-23 15:09:03 Cenk Bey bu şirket Çin’in Apple olarak tanınıyor. Her üründen %5 kar alacağını garanti etti. Yani daha fazla ürün satmak zorunda. Bu ucuzluğu getiriyor. Tr ye tam girmiş değil ama bilenler getirtip bu markanın ürünlerini çok ucuza alıyorlar.

3670 2018-07-23 15:08:36 escojeria los 150 Bitcoins, al tenerlos tengo mas que el 1 y 2, las crypto son las monedas del futuro asi que preferiria guardarlas hasta un futuro cercano, sobre la cena paso, prefiero a linus torvalds

3682 2018-07-23 15:05:32 All the misinformation about @isTruStory spreading on crypto twitter is exactly why we need @isTruStory
3683 2018-07-23 15:05:26 Lots of bulls on crypto twitter. Just a reminder how this usually goes. Remember to make the case that goes against the masses, as well as your biases. See both sides and it’s harder to lose. Also, you can’t lose if you take profit.

This is one of the best crypto projects of the 21st century! I believe in this company
3685 2018-07-23 15:04:43 Need a global crypto action task force on the lines of regional FATF bodies because crypto is non jurisdictional and needs specialized technology intervention to prevent fraud, aml & hacking

The body can create global best practices. Open main stream fiat access.

3688 2018-07-23 15:04:21 ICO割れが叫ばれている昨今ですが、下手なICOに手を出すより自分が調べて保有しているLiskのDappsのICOなら情報も収集しやすいし中身もわかりやすいので期待値高いです！なのでDapps関連のトークンには下心もありありなのです！BRIKトークンも期待してますが大本命はPAXトークンです！

3695 2018-07-23 15:03:30 That trend line, the red one, should be a curved one. A trend line is never a linear straight line. Think about it.

4359 2018-07-23 13:48:05 Depending on $btc price people start to do the math on the $kash miners and future cash flow and thousands of miners times thousands of dollars per coin equals millions of dollars of cash flow. Not impossible especially if we get back to new highs in crypto prices.
4360 2018-07-23 13:47:45 Last time this year BTC weren’t down 60% from ATH and alts down 80%. Alts will move up with $BTC untill a certain point. A bullish BTC will prove crypto ain’t dead and as alts have the highest ROI, money will flow in here too.

I can't thank @Brad2pointO  and @AltOne_Crypto,  whom I don't know, for bringing my attention to it.

4377 2018-07-23 13:45:28 I’ve been in Crypto since sept/nov of ‘17.  Being new to the market I was completely overwhelmed and still learning during the late year bull run.  What was the catalyst to cause the historical run in the market?

4379 2018-07-23 13:44:54 We haven’t seen the #Bitcoin shorts get pummeled since their inception. Curious to see what happens when they do. Could it be the catalyst that accelerates (similar, but opposite to new investors of actual #BTC entering at ATH) BTC to new ATH by the end of the year?

4481 2018-07-23 13:28:29 Crypto investing is crazy reflexive—projects in logo-hunting social proof mode from day zero. Few will actually ship something that actually fulfills the hyperbole. 

DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. 

Never invest just because founder went to Stanford, ex-FB, or has impressive investors.

4500 2018-07-23 13:25:29 If anyone thought of investing in crypto nows your chance. The bubble has been popped, either wait for a pull back or buy now and don’t sell unless it goes below 5,800$
4501 2018-07-23 13:25:21 I can piss on the toilet seat and report to you that i did. If XRP moves up in price you can write your blog about how the price went up because i pissed on the toilet seat. You can refer to me as the self proclaimed son of whatever crypto god is out there. Looking forward to it
4502 2018-07-23 13:25:17 Fraudsters seem to be dong a better job than most learning resources teaching people how to transfer funds using crypto.

4510 2018-07-23 13:23:20 I think Crypto Twitter has forgotten what "shill" actually means. It means to pretend or decieve people into thinking you are a happy customer to reap a reward. Promoting a site or service that you actually love that happens to have a referral program is not shilling. It's smart.

4512 2018-07-23 13:23:01 Charlie Munger, the Vice Chairman of Warren Buffett's investment titan, Berkshire Hathaway, has compared crypto trading to the sale of harvested baby brains.

4850 2018-07-23 12:40:18 I wasn’t countering that point.

But I will. It’s the full sum of a crypto’s properties that is value accretive (VA). I feel like you’re insinuating that PoW is VA but PoS isn’t which is silly. Both are work for security. And as I point out, PoS is not merely redistributive.

Crypto: Nothing new since 2017
Quantum: One week ago

Something is coming
4852 2018-07-23 12:40:13 I think this chart is a little deceptive. The crypto crowd is conditioned to big gains & volatility. In the chart above, the sharpest spikes happen during the recessions. In 1974 & again in 1980, gold nearly doubled. In 2008-2009, gold went up 50%. That’s big for an $8T asset.

4925 2018-07-23 12:31:27 Very good project, with great prospects! a great idea that will surely interest many investors. good luck to the whole team that is working on this project
#Fyrus, #ICO, #Blockchain, #Crypto.
4926 2018-07-23 12:31:26 All #crypto is 'pricey' (read massively overvalued) when set against early 2017. It could all dump at some point, but these things take time. In 6 months we'll regret worrying about daily price movements, either because it all went south, or hit ATH again. Time will tell.
4927 2018-07-23 12:31:16 ぶっちゃけ全部安いですよ。安いですが、まずビットコインに資金が流れてから の割安のアルトって流れは間違いないです。具体的にはBTCが94万円ぐらいで一服したら、利確して割安アルトに入れればいいんじゃないですか？と思うわけです。円で買ってもいいですけど、出来ればBTC建てで！続き

4930 2018-07-23 12:31:05 The super team must bring the idea to a high level. The project is already in its infancy and is a tasty morsel for potential investors. Without a doubt, the project will succeed. Now is the time to join!#Fyrus, #ICO, #Blockchain, #Crypto.
4931 2018-07-23 12:31:05 And yeah, feeling absolutely locked up in all of these positions is really annoying when you see all sorts of new buy in ops left and right.

4936 2018-07-23 12:30:18 Jro & The @BitcoinBravado crew doesnt get enough respect.

Bravado team is very well educated in the space & they know what they’re talking about. Much respect from me. My favorite crypto crew. Discord wreaks of helpful information.
4937 2018-07-23 12:30:10 In the crypto currency world, there are over 1000 kind of cryptos in coinmarketcap, but almost of them is not good, only some of them is good, and they have a special function, special application for the some field. Xxx is one of them. #Plentix

4940 2018-07-23 12:29:34 90% ICO is scam in crypto. People make more ICO to earn alots money (maybe 1M$ for each). People who join into these ICOs dont have knowledge about technology, blockchain, crypto,... to see these ICO is a scam. But I'm programmer, it's easy with me. #DEEPAERO #DRONE #ICO

5002 2018-07-23 12:19:49 True that.
5003 2018-07-23 12:19:46 why is it these government have the authority on non fiat transactions where crypto has no ties to currency really other than a computer code base that does math?
5004 2018-07-23 12:19:22 I was referencing the dips on Major Alts (eos,neo,ltc etc) from the last highs around 18 July.

They bled heavily whilst BTC has held. (money moving into BTC to keep this push going?) BTC makes new highs whilst neo for exmaple was still 15%+ down.
5005 2018-07-23 12:19:04 My mistake

5024 2018-07-23 12:16:08 Trick is to get the mainstream to use it...how? By providing ways of using crypto. Eg. #NakitCoins

5179 2018-07-23 11:55:53 Governments will likely create “digital” currencies but not “crypto” currencies. Cryptography will not be involved. And it will be similar to the intranet (private), instead of a public blockchain. They will want control.

5191 2018-07-23 11:53:59 Is there a difference between Karpeles stealing your coins and some anonymous thugs running a factory for ERC20 clones? It happens, because there is an endless incentive. From fiat to crypto, from crypto to buying 100% centralized printed fiat tokens. You've done well.

Then once Evolution is released it will spike, perfect for some quick profits before a pull back.
5273 2018-07-23 11:44:20 It can make you nervous yes, but if we head back to 6.8, how much % is that correcting?  At worst, we fall back to 5.5-5.8, and still % wise, that's not that bad

5302 2018-07-23 11:40:06 gulden is a fine crypto, but its value will probably first drop to 500 sats. so bitcoin will be stronger. however, if the euro value of btc rises, nlg will most likely rise in euro value. there can be a lot of volume injected on bittrex suddenly, so a pump is also an option.

5327 2018-07-23 11:37:21 “Your” fiat currencies. Stop changing the debate. There is no debating fiat currencies are communist/centrally planned. That doesn’t require debating. I’m specifically critiquing BTC, LTC, BCH etc... because they are guaranteed to die. Another crypto will come along and be king.
5328 2018-07-23 11:37:00 Cryptocurrency is a blockchain asset and not the liability of anyone. Central bank issued digital currency is based on a fractional reserve banking system based on debt and the liability of increasingly highly indebted nation state central banks.(2/2)

5331 2018-07-23 11:36:46 The point of Bitcoin is that it has guaranteed limit amount of issued tokens. If a central bank cannot control the supply then a central bank crypto is pointless.

5342 2018-07-23 11:35:37 The crypto market is still a very early-stage industry.

I would be more worried about the fact that most companies are beta-stage, than the volatility of crypto as a market, if I was an outside investor.

5350 2018-07-23 11:34:56 @Crypto_Belief 
Am interested in cryptocurrency but I think the rate of addition of crypto coins/tokens in the market need to be regulated.
5351 2018-07-23 11:34:55 Also, what's different about your current fiat currencies? You can say they're centrally planned as well since you have bankers and committees printing according to their whims. So even if btc/other crypto cannot beat gold, it's still better than the current monetary policy

5398 2018-07-23 11:27:11 Correct. The point I was making is 50bn tokens of the 100bn total supply will be given away to Telcos at a rate of 5% per year for 10 years... essentially wiping 5% off the total supply per year. It is not technically a coinburn, but could be viewed that way.

5603 2018-07-23 10:54:59 1. Even the slightest possibility of bitcoin failing would keep them from accepting it.           2. It’s naive to think Bezos personally doesn’t own at least 10k bitcoin

5618 2018-07-23 10:51:31 再度のロードマップの遅延は投資対象の企業として致命的ですが、それ以上に透明性が高い企業なのでマイナス部分よりも評価出来るポイントが多いのがLiskのよい所です。GitHubを覗いたり今後の展開を拾っていかないとメンタルやられるコインです。知ってる人は楽観出来るコインかと思います！

5628 2018-07-23 10:50:25 $TRX is yet again most talked about #crypto on twitter. Why? 

1. BitTorrent acquisition confirmed

2. Migration from $ETH practically complete to #TRON network

3. July 30 Tron Virtual Machine launch

4. July 30 ‘Secret Project’ announcement

5. Loyal #TRX community 

6. Amazon.

5746 2018-07-23 10:33:17 Can someone please tell me why NPXS keeps dropping on price despite having a working product. Or people in crypto don’t like working product but speculative projects? it is just not making any sense at all. Is this token price being MANIPULATED intentionally?

5757 2018-07-23 10:31:29 No, because some of the men who are on Twitter exclusively to talk crypto were thought to be female.
I’m not sure what it uses to determine gender but from what I’ve seen, it’s been wrong way more than right.

5873 2018-07-23 10:13:29 Welcome to Crypto 
5874 2018-07-23 10:13:18 how many million Kin, haha.
5875 2018-07-23 10:13:14 What are you targeting for BTC to begin loading up on BAT? My eyes are on BAT,ZRX, XLM and ADA but right now BTC is currently dominating and making these alts bleed.
5876 2018-07-23 10:13:08 We’ve already been to 7700
5877 2018-07-23 10:12:55 "not a single correct call in 6 months" was your statement. I replied in DM with 27 correct in 1 week.....
And never heard again from you.
You start to become a meme on CT, dude
5878 2018-07-23 10:12:42 $BTC next target 9400 aprox.!

5886 2018-07-23 10:11:22 A lot of Crypto people with large followings are up their assess. "I helped people pay loans" or "made their life better". You might have made a call in the last run, but don't get ahead of yourself. Be humble and gracious. Bragging about goodness only results in failure overtime
5887 2018-07-23 10:10:57 Check it yourself. 
Look, everyone can be wrong in his expectations but stop turning 180° every move and bragging about your predictions.
5888 2018-07-23 10:10:54 Best choice

5895 2018-07-23 10:09:53 Tax rules are still very different depending where you live, mostly because its a new asset class that nobody understands, however crypto is too lucrative for most states to let it be tax free in the long run. I'm expecting tax free zones will mostly vanish over time.

5901 2018-07-23 10:07:58 Watching #Bitcoin push again against heavy technical resistance near ~$7.8k as the day gets going in US. 

A break could swing this well above $8k & expect BTC to gain greater crypto dominance outperforming most (dying) alts.

3/ outlaws currencies, anonymity and decentralisation
4/ encourage short termism

5989 2018-07-23 09:54:23 The elephant in the room is price stability. I suspect bulk of the small transactions today are for novelty reasons. The big transactions are borderline money laundering.

6011 2018-07-23 09:51:15 It is precisely when we stop that sort of self questioning that we become liable to do things like eg "don't be evil" or "connext the people of the world". I think there is not just a risk but a strong prior expectation that the crypto world will fall into the same pattern.

6571 2018-07-23 08:14:57 Pro crypto trader prediction tip:

1. Call an outrageous number. I.E, bitcoin to $50k, ether to $2k by next month.

2. Vague reason: Institutional investors, ETF

3. Target not reached: say its for long term and market condition changed.

Done! You're a pro crypto expert. #crypto

6684 2018-07-23 07:55:27 The market (writ large) almost never spots the signal (other than by pure luck) and is addicted to the noise. All financial markets affected in this way, not just crypto. Survivor bias then lets us post facto 'identify the geniuses'!

6708 2018-07-23 07:51:08 The most decentralized coin in crypto is Ethereum. Ethereum is protocol where you can do whatever you want without killed. Even what you do is spamming the protocol. It's proven time over time. The only one case Ethereum is questioned when DAO made a fork from Ethereum.

7186 2018-07-23 06:32:47 I’m not saying Crypto is not the future money, it is. I’m saying that a zero block reward likely will not work. It’s a quota (communist). If gold and silver miners had a zero chance of finding precious metals, they’d stop mining.

7192 2018-07-23 06:32:17 Blockchain technology gives us so much more than just transparency and peer to peer transactions.
Allthough these have been needed on a mass scale since the beginning of human trade, why let a third party take a percentage of a transaction between 2 people? Crypto solves this.

Very few!  

Why is that?  

Because most have no idea how to navigate the “Markets” successfully, right?  

Who benefits from a Crypto-currency that is traded on an “Exchange?”  

The people that own the “Exchange” is the correct answer!

7325 2018-07-23 06:04:28 A word of advice, don't reduce the nicotive lvl too fast. Give your body room and time to adjust. I started with 6mg, went all the way up to 12mg because it wasn't sufficient enough for me for almost 12 months. Take it slow, now I'm at around 4-6 again.

7497 2018-07-23 05:38:37 That’s safe. You’ll miss out on some but you won’t have timing risk (I bought last week, ouch). I think part of the problem is Coinbase announced other assets, so the spotlight shifted. It’s the best alt for the next month imo in terms of R/R
7498 2018-07-23 05:38:36 I don't think the info for Germany is correct. You are paying income taxes on crypto and they can go up to 42%, depending on your income. Plus if you hold for more then one year, it is tax free. Can you put the source of the info into the spreadsheet?

7530 2018-07-23 05:32:28 Personally I think discussion of network effects is important in crypto. But I think that crypto has inherited a few of the major flaws in SV discourse on network effects. Examples: 1) Viewing network effects of properties of companies/protocols vs specific loops within them 2)
7531 2018-07-23 05:32:18 Translation: Bayleigh's black therefore without any proof or actually watching the show, she's automatically loud and confrontational.
7532 2018-07-23 05:32:03 Oops I think you were talking about Bitcoin. In regards to ETC it’s just a matter of Coinbase. Most alts will bleed as bitcoin advances (im still heavy alts bc I don’t want to miss time). I think Coinbase happens sooner rather than later

7595 2018-07-23 05:21:13 Internal logistics: operations around accepting/storing, security around private keys, lack of custody solutions. Costs money and time to integrate. Who won't buy from them that would if they accepted BTC? All solvable but a low pain point for customers (for now).

With GLN, gamers will purchase in-game upgrades, developers will fund passion projects, and crypto enthusiasts can hold a token with actual utility.

そもそも今の金融システムを悪と見る色眼鏡には疑問なんですよね。もちろん課題はあるので改善するという選択が正しいように思います。

7619 2018-07-23 05:17:10 I think in their position with the revenue they’re seeing it’s a risk/reward type of thing. Marketing edge is real I agree, but custodial hurdles and volatility might outweigh that from the perspective of a company sitting /comfy/ with its current model

7748 2018-07-23 04:58:23 You can take advantage of how irrational crypto markets are. 

“Hype” coins w/ no working product get valued at billions. 

Yet coins like $tfd and $aura - existing products that actually generate revenue - sit at under $20 mil market cap.

7769 2018-07-23 04:55:04 There's so much confusion in US government circles regarding crypto. First, they say: "Bitcoin has no intrinsic value,"

But ...

"The Russians used Bitcoin to finance their meddling in our election systems."

Wait: where did the value come from?
7770 2018-07-23 04:55:01 So are you shorting now based on that signal?

7778 2018-07-23 04:53:18 Currencies are a problem. Blockchain can evolve to a Hashgraph level, but multiple currencies are inane and need an overcurrency - one currency to rule them all. Bitcoin is silly. Ether could be a good standard, since it’s the soil in which all things grow.

7969 2018-07-23 04:17:21 Depends how quick we can get these cards into circulation that let us spend crypto. As it becomes more the norm international businesses will use it more that do it will then settle int contracts in btc or similar. Will happen quickly once started but still a decade away

7990 2018-07-23 04:13:05 ここ最近はETHが下げ→BTCドミナンス増→BTC価格上げ。こんなイメージ。

ドミナンスが上がる限りBTCも上がると思うが、すでに45%あるのにそこまで価格が上がっていないのがよくない。
またアルトに資金が回った時に、BTCは前の底値を簡単に割る可能性が高くなるから。

* Apps have been rejected twice before

8065 2018-07-23 03:58:54 @BradSherman the comment on banning crypto/bitcoin merely a party line play sir? Bitcoin’s only use is for illegal activity? Really? You can’t be that ignorant. It has to be politics since it seems there are many republicans that would rather figure out a way to embrace the space
8066 2018-07-23 03:58:52 I'm not into crypto at all but a friend in KPMG in Tokyo told me they had meetings with IOTA early thus year and considered it a frontrunner.  It probably has the best chance amongst the pack.

8086 2018-07-23 03:54:11 Thank you
8087 2018-07-23 03:54:06 Yes true. CME are one to watch out. They do 3 month contracts and the next 2 contracts opened at low levels so guess what? We get a bull trend soon based on that. They opened in the 6k and 7k region so they'll want the price to be higher than 7ks in August and September

8101 2018-07-23 03:51:41 xrp is kind of tricky.. I don't consider it a "true crypto" I see it more as a companies digital asset. That being said.. it some how pumps when we get a new crop of crypto traders involved in the crypto world.
8102 2018-07-23 03:51:41 A pump would also only generate more liquidity as people start longing. RSI is at levels it was when we were at 10k and we havnt been any higher RSI than this since we were in a bull market. We may get a slight pump to mid 7.7 before the drop. That's what I think good sir

8109 2018-07-23 03:49:10 The previous pump from 6.3k to 7.4k was CBOE furtures expiring and that was only a 1 months contract therefore a long (If I'm right). This pump is outside of CME trading hours if I'm right, imo we close Friday low 7ks if not 6.8/6.9k. This looks toppy as is anyway.

Maybe there're people who need to pay more. Though if being taxed on crypo too heavily, we lose liquidity.

8296 2018-07-23 03:16:15 Too many crypto founders are worried about who is on their advisory board, which fund logos they can put on their deck, and how large their Telegram groups are.

They should be much more worried about whether their products work and if people want to use it.

8347 2018-07-23 03:06:10 No... Its simply a change in algo. "core crypto" is just code that will work with whatever algorithm is implemented.  What changes would BTC require other than an algo change? Be specific if you would, I'm curious.
8348 2018-07-23 03:05:42 People betting reputations on if Bitcoin will go to $8k, or $4.8k first.

But, to me, #crypto is binary. 

You either believe it’s going to take over the world, or not.

Short term market swings don’t grab my attention much.

8412 2018-07-23 02:53:56 3 dollar would mean about 500x.. Though unrealistic, is possible in the crypto world.. But the way OCN has been bluffing... A lot of people are getting skeptical... I would be really happy if it manages to touch 10 cents :D
8413 2018-07-23 02:53:50 oof
8414 2018-07-23 02:53:32 People really need to show that they believe in #bitcoin instead of just selling it to get some quick short-term gains. #BTC #crypto

8420 2018-07-23 02:52:39 This is not simply a change in algo, change in core crypto.  NIST again said it would take 15 years for all Suite b crypto to be altered to new resistant crypto.  Also, attackers more likely to subvert the chain, before forking happens, esp nation state who are always ahead.

G２０の不安解消？新規締め出してる間に大口が買いだしてる？
それとも撒き餌でしかなくてここから下落・・・？

8549 2018-07-23 02:29:51 My prediction is b/t $5-$10 Trillion of tokens will exist into year 20'. Currently, the total Crypto market cap is at $285 Billion. I expect 17X+ growth conservatively. Robust smart contract platforms are likely to gain the most multiples- tokenizing, computation, currencies.

8553 2018-07-23 02:27:23 ほとんどの仮想通貨はそもそも時価総額が少ないので、心理が一方に傾くと一気にそっちに行ってしまう傾向がありますよね。
イエローデビルの場合はそれが大きいからみんなを引っ張ってしまう。

8565 2018-07-23 02:25:13 This is absolutely true. However, its mostly due to the mindset of majority crypto investors. Unless they see big names attached to the project's advisory board or huge number of following on social groups, they think of the project as an scam.

8627 2018-07-23 02:16:25 To be fair, I think it’s actually pseudo-anarchic and crypto-fascist or crypto-kleptocratic.  Nothing wrong with the old red n’ black if compassionate, and not rules like by corporate overlords.
8628 2018-07-23 02:16:11 それはライトコインだな。一番最初に生まれたビットコインのクローンになる。あと若干送金時間がビットコインより優れている。昔はよく使われていたが、最近はとんと使われているのを見たことがないな。

8639 2018-07-23 02:14:46 If you think on longterm possibilities $xlm is a good candidate. With the $xrp doom, and  overall fundamentals, $xlm has a spot on crypto future. (Large cap one, but imo undervalued af.)
8640 2018-07-23 02:14:39 Until we understand what has gone into the simulation mathematically exactly we cant say for certain.

Then reopen the QT wallet.

8705 2018-07-23 02:03:23 @BradSherman do you really care about people? why pursue the status quo of money? we need a new value proposition and store of value that cannot be manipulated. banning miners and crypto is definitely counterproductive. other countries will pass us by when they unpeg USD(someday)

Crypto is an innovative technology, however there are issues that need to be addressed. It doesn’t fulfill the requirements of being a sovereign currency but it does not pose a global security risk but will continue to monitor.

8842 2018-07-23 01:31:34 #Bitcoin Price has increased 10% since 15th July. But what needs to be noted is, the overall #crypto market cap as per #CoinMarketCap has increased to $255bn from $282bn. That doesn't tell the story since the YoYo'ing of BTC price caused the #Altcoins to fall more than 20%.

If they approve that then Bitcoin will skyrocket and once all that new money is in Bitcoin THEN pull the trigger on alts being added. Right now, is not the right environment for any listings, imo.

8872 2018-07-23 01:24:43 I've been thinking about this more often lately. how can we prepare, diversification, precious metals, and cash on hand?

8919 2018-07-23 01:11:22 My rules & experience. I trade crypto different to stocks and I enjoy the tech analysis but when they run I use a go with the flow approach and just get in the rhythm with pilot buys & sells until I am in the flow. Of a 72 hour trade bender I might take 12 hours to find that flow

8921 2018-07-23 01:11:10 You sound reasonable; I hope it works out for you! Bitcoin is already not a security and some more will be classified the same. So you have a few options without changing the law.

8949 2018-07-23 01:03:54 He's a millionaire trader though so locking up capital would be a concern. Possible it could add another multiple to returns with the right strategy.
8950 2018-07-23 01:03:51 So do I double down on ICX or buy Etc 
8951 2018-07-23 01:03:28 Its halted for god knows why. Share price got crushed since it relaunched as $cryp from $rgt but still has a solid crypto business plan and I'm hoping it's just manipulation going on. Not awesome but over a longer period of time will take care of itself.
8952 2018-07-23 01:03:28 Let’s talk! I know nothing about masternodes so were can I read up and more important how much money can I make?

8988 2018-07-23 00:55:51 There is more to money laundering than tax returns. There is back channel money Shell Corps., Crypto Currency etc. No doubt Mueller has evidence by now but there is a question if a sitting president can be indicted. One thing is true though he can be impeached.

『恋愛や魅力の心理学を研究している川名好裕・立正大学教授は「男性が女性に惹きつけられるのには、美的魅力と性的魅力とがあり、どうしても誤解する男性が出てくるが、本音は暑いということだけで、見せているのはお前じゃないということだ」と話す。』

9054 2018-07-23 00:42:33 There is a general opinion that crypto is not a female business. While some women may disagree on whether the topic is worthy of discussion or not, one thing is clear. We’re not going to sit in the sidelines while our male counterparts ride the blockchain wave. …

9057 2018-07-23 00:41:38 Q. Why do 95% of #crypto projects need a token?
A. They don't; but if @EOS_io can raise $4 Billion without a product, or even a clear vision of how it's product might function, why not? 

A project can only make as much as people will give them...we've done this to ourselves.
9058 2018-07-23 00:41:32 If you think about it the Crypto community is seeking a bail out from the banks by begging for institutional money to come into the market and pleading for an ETF.

9092 2018-07-23 00:33:58 Fair enough. Many will lose money in crypto.  But there is no "the answer", which is why I as a non-accredited (yet) investor would prefer access to any opportunities I want. I don't believe there is a low-risk path from poverty to wealth in 1 generation. Let me take risks.

9122 2018-07-23 00:26:23 Game developers & publishers can now bypass middlemen to more effectively acquire new gamers. They can channel their current advertising spend into directly rewarding gamers with Mfun tokens.

9154 2018-07-23 00:17:30 Everyone makes mistakes. My point is that the law makes sense at some level. I think 95% of crypto is going to zero and it’s almost all retail money. I’m all in favor of improving the lives of working families, but crypto is not the answer.

9182 2018-07-23 00:13:35 There are actually two sets of Russians indicted.13 who ran the troll farm,  & the 12 members of Russia's GRU that were just indicted. 25 total and all were indicted by Mueller. Cohen was turned over to NY because of financial crimes that are crimes against the State of NY.
9183 2018-07-23 00:13:26 The common crypto lexicon includes a lot of terms that are negations of opposing concepts: decentralized, trustless, zero-knowledge proofs. They differentiate, but don't describe. I'd love to see them eventually replaced by more expressive terms

9186 2018-07-23 00:12:41 Many failed startups raised money on the back of a "business model". Some were scams (Theranos). 

This isn't exclusive to crypto.

Would you rather the crypto space self-regulate or wait until the government cracks down? The latter would hurt the *entire* space - BTC included.

Hope you don't mind my direct approach.

Let me know if you are interested to explore further.

9215 2018-07-23 00:08:46 That would be awesome 
9216 2018-07-23 00:08:41 I exit my position when I'm wrong, that's technically a mental stoploss. It gives me much needed flexibility. Depends on your style of trading though, swing traders should be using stops!
9217 2018-07-23 00:08:41 Someone just mansplained that I can’t comment on a LinkedIn discussion on crypto currency because I’m a fiction author. I might suggest he do a little more research before telling me what I am & am not qualified to do.

9220 2018-07-23 00:08:25 CBA banned credit card purchases of crypto legitimately. Slyly at the same time, barred debit authorisation charges so former credit card users couldn't switch to using debit card on Coinbase or other exchanges that use the 2*$1 charges to verify ID. #scum
9221 2018-07-23 00:08:17 Actually that is part of the new direction for the project. There is one coin. $LUPX. The value will be in the dAPP platform and use case within. It was all a joke until a team of real developers and coders came along. Read the medium article that was posted this weekend
9222 2018-07-23 00:08:02 Hey AC -what a big victory for you to fight hard through surgery and recovery. Thanks for sharing your story! My kids are into crypto too and we're all cheering for you here in Canada - full steam ahead! 
9223 2018-07-23 00:07:48 Weird, this article doesn’t load too. Are you sure your Nedium account is fine?
9224 2018-07-23 00:07:35 Bitcoin (BTC). In yr 2140 max 21 million coins. 8/17/17 hard fork new crypto currency Bitcoin Cash (BCH) another 21 million coins. 10/17/17 hard fork another crypto Bitcoin Gold (BTG) and another 21 million coins.  So which one will prevail?
9225 2018-07-23 00:07:21 Which actually led me to think that when MMs target liquidity pool they don’t expect stops to be triggered but more breakout traders to FOMO in/panic sell
9226 2018-07-23 00:06:58 I haven’t tried Coinigy but it will.  Thanks for the recommendation.
