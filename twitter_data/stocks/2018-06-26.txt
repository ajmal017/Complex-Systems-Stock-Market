8 2018-06-26 23:46:14 That's the whole idea.  Give the tax breaks to CEOs and share-holders, start a tariff war, drive the stock market way down, then buy up more stocks for less money, then back off the tariff war, the stock market goes up and all the rich guys make mega $$$ on it.

38 2018-06-26 23:33:17 Always with the wise words.  Thanks stocks. Makes complete sense.  Buyers should return if approval hopefully. Go $arry
39 2018-06-26 23:32:11 Calling God stupid and this “anti-tambay” thing are just classic Duterte moves of diverting our attention from the ridiculously high inflation rate, PH stocks entering bear market, decreasing investors’ confidence, depreciating PHP and more economic pains ahead.

Focus, Pilipinas
40 2018-06-26 23:32:10 Yep looking forward to it. Some stocks are so undervalued it is crazy even unbelievable that they are at these levels. Buying now should see some very good returns in the next few months imo.

42 2018-06-26 23:31:39 Next year... hmmm maybe ask for old stocks or something xD the websites have back issues I think
43 2018-06-26 23:31:21 I think in Australia we are more similar to the USA. Everyone has retirement funds  with stocks or self managed fund with with stocks or property or just a private portfolio of stocks. My old school principal said his retirement was severely delayed by 08 crash

49 2018-06-26 23:29:27 agreed. he needs to comm like all the other presidents. Twitter is doing this for stocks & ratings. must be nice to have the highest quarter & high user growth which *literally* tracks to the rise of the greatest authoritarian we've met in 75 years.
50 2018-06-26 23:29:23 @jimcramer hi,  Thank you for informative show. I have WALMART stocks I have to sell within the next 60 days. Is there a best time to sell? Does the day of the week matter or when the quarterly reports come out?
51 2018-06-26 23:29:12 @jimcramer can you recommend 5 dividend stocks so I can diversify my dividend strategy. I want them to sit for 10 years. #MadTweets

58 2018-06-26 23:18:31 If you invest in a company in hopes the competition will tank and your stocks would skyrocket those stocks he already bought shouldn't have had a thing happen to them. Just sell em off. It is lazy writing to get an airport action scene.
59 2018-06-26 23:16:24 Raven, lives on Meritage Drive with too many horses.

Put all their savings into mustard stocks. Can't retire.
60 2018-06-26 23:15:04 I'm sorry you are wrong. Stocks suffer worst day in weeks as Trump’s trade threats rattle; Dow ends below key level. Trump believes the stock market is an indication of the economy. He brags when it rises.
61 2018-06-26 23:15:02 Interesting.
What other stocks do you like?
62 2018-06-26 23:14:45 @harleydavidson is building bikes in India now. This brainless #TradeWar will not be good for #American workers, only the 1% who own millions in stocks. Our economy is global and he should know that based on who financed his bankruptcies.

67 2018-06-26 23:11:04 Are you deaf and dumb?  Of course they did.  Everyone will.  That's Trump's plan.  Start a tariff war and drive the stock market down so the share-holders can buy stocks cheaply and make $$$ when he backs out of this.  We know him & his agenda.  He is transparent.
68 2018-06-26 23:10:24 yes bes, depende kung atin lang stocks keng grado mu, pag ala, papagbalikan dka kanta.
69 2018-06-26 23:09:50 What does that even mean? What hot take tweeters? There's a difference between investors and traders. The traders are driving the smart money and this recent rapid run up and I think they'll will bail once its official. We'll see though. Media stocks are hot now.
70 2018-06-26 23:09:44 I have an overwhelming NEED for these but haven’t found a shop that stocks them yet 
71 2018-06-26 23:09:01 Most people don’t have stocks, but they do see the tax cuts on their check stubs and help wanted signs. Nice try at trying to change the topic tho. Btw...since you don’t live in Montgomery county, pish off.
72 2018-06-26 23:08:54 me, lying in bed eating pot stickers: I should invest in stocks
73 2018-06-26 23:08:53 Dow is not market. S&P 500 better! S&P1500 still better. I actually do not invest in U.S stocks. This analyst? From stone age? Like Trump? Isolationist like Trump? Why infatuation with Dow? As meaningless as GE! Or even as  druggist Walgreen! Lousy Index tinkering!
74 2018-06-26 23:08:15 Stocks are higher today than when Obama left office. When stocks go up, it's better than when they go down. Therefore, my comment stands. All you have left is "nazi" this and "bozo" that. R's have the majority & D's have minority in Congress & the Hill. Failed policies are why

78 2018-06-26 23:05:22 Im down with bump stocks being banned. They dont alter the functionailty of the firearm, reduce your ability to hit a target (especially from 400m away), and are all around considered as party favors.

But sure, I agree with banning them.
79 2018-06-26 23:04:01 Europeans just don't have equity retirement funds, are quite risk averse ... tax system does not promote holding stocks ... different mentalities but there is no correlation between stock markets and consumption in Europe
80 2018-06-26 23:03:37 10 breakouts: $SPPI (gap), $TEGP (200-day MA). No penny stocks so bulls playing cautious with no rush to speculative, weak stocks.

84 2018-06-26 23:00:21 These are the 3 stocks in finance sector that yesterday set all-time highs:
$NGHCP, $FRPH, $KKR
85 2018-06-26 23:00:05 I wasnt thinking that. I've seen this plenty of times with other stocks where increases have been based on the hype leading up to the official announcement. Once that is made there is no more domestic TV rights talk left to push the stock price up so I think the smarts will sell.
86 2018-06-26 22:58:54 Stocks
87 2018-06-26 22:58:37 FAKE NEWS!  80% of workers will realize a $.03 raise over the year.  The majority of the money goes to CEO raises, share buy backs, stock holders, etc.  When the stock market drops, which was planned, they buy back stocks at a cut rate price & make $$ when stocks rise.
88 2018-06-26 22:58:30 Stocks staged a recovery Tuesday, shaking off escalating trade tensions that have been weighing on global markets. The dollar rallied against a basket of peers. Treasury yields inched higher.
89 2018-06-26 22:58:27 It's nights like these that I congratulate myself for planting honeysuckles, jasmines and lemons ... and berate myself for neglectiing to plant night-scented stocks which are amazing.  It's a veritable smellscape out there!
90 2018-06-26 22:57:25 That's what they say they are doing,  what they are actually doing is buying back their own stocks,  ie artificially inflating their stocks.
91 2018-06-26 22:57:15 @jimcramer what do you think about buying good stocks that pay 4-6% dividends and live off just the dividends when one retires?
92 2018-06-26 22:54:35 Download the robinhood app, u kan trade stocks for free, it’s an official brokerage app. Klutch for beginners. Do your research on how the stock market works as well. YouTube beginner videos.
93 2018-06-26 22:54:33 Gonna go Golok to shop everything for some stocks 
94 2018-06-26 22:53:16 @jimcramer loved the idea of buying stocks to kids. Once we were frustrated waiting on a long line at Disney Tokyo. I encouraged my daughters to become the owner ("one of" they point out) of Disney. We bought the stock while waiting.
95 2018-06-26 22:52:25 Lies/hyperbole, Yanny/Laurel. Trump's for all Americas; others divide. What populist policies do you wish he had implemented? He banned bump stocks and sought a higher age limit, but could do more.
96 2018-06-26 22:52:23 I would feel anxious about any stocks I held who are based in trump’s ‘Mericka!
97 2018-06-26 22:52:11 Everybody relax. The USA will come on top in the tariff war. Don't you see how Asian stocks are struggling....ended the day in the red 6/26/18 while our stocks thrived today? I know that's for today but the President may be right after all. Trade's unfair.

101 2018-06-26 22:48:39 Anyone who supports bump stocks is clearly ok with mass murder. There is no legitimate purpose for them. This issues defines the NRA and GOA who say they care, but clearly don't. Ban bumpstocks. Ban them now!

118 2018-06-26 22:31:22 #FOMO I suspect shares will go higher and may even close the gap but eventually the sells will overwhelm the buys and there will be the mad scramble to exit.

120 2018-06-26 22:30:04 I just learned on @MadMoneyOnCNBC that I need to invest ~$10K in an index fund or ETF that mirrors the S&P prior to investing my #MadMoney into individual stocks and companies with high upside.

131 2018-06-26 22:21:24 I remember the cod wars Iceland extended its fishing area illegally and tried to stop UK fishermen legally fishing. The EU  has allowed fishing to reduce fish stocks even fishing off Africa. Depriving poor countries of their livelihood. Nothing nice about the EU and fishing.

134 2018-06-26 22:17:10 Is this a warning ahead of big auto layoffs? Burned by Harley Davidson  and you know auto layoffs and stock market crash coming? Your tariffs are utter failure and I am SELLING MY STOCKS tomorrow- .. got to save my retirement before this shit hits the fan
135 2018-06-26 22:16:52 It’s been 500 days, BHO doubled it during his first term -remember cash for clunkers
136 2018-06-26 22:16:42 Neither are reliable in the long run. Issue is confident Fed / higher rates has so far and is historically a positive for assets. Lower rates would now spell trouble by fuelling yield curve term premia. There is a reason for Powell to be hawkish... low term premia = + stocks
137 2018-06-26 22:16:04 I’m not a programmer, but it seems to me that if you can teach a computer to trade stocks or drive a car, you can damn well teach it to draw fair and equal voting districts without partisan bickering...
138 2018-06-26 22:15:32 Honestly mate I'm not really interested! 
Too much negitive energy coming from you guys compared to the ride the next few weeks will be on #GGP 

As they say, you pay your money, you take your choice. I own shares you guys don't! 


139 2018-06-26 22:14:20 You give big corp money and they will use it to buy back stocks and innovate. This will lead to lower wages for the middle class. Beware of kleptocracy.
140 2018-06-26 22:13:25 While all defense industry stocks are going down like crazy @LockheedMartin or @Raytheon and yet we are trying to block sales of F-35s to the biggest NATO ally. We need to sell more weapons to our allies to make sure they don't buy it somewhere else. @POTUS

145 2018-06-26 22:09:23 I also got a call in the morning but it was from a Portuguese man telling me to invest in chicken stocks in bad english. (I know that sounds like a r/thathappened strong but it happened.)
146 2018-06-26 22:09:23 Don't be ridiculous. I made my money in ggp last year. I moved on elsewhere. I cud have bought last week on a chart buy signal but invested elsewhere. But my views remain the same. Its being pumped..... for a reason as you will no doubt find out in due course

150 2018-06-26 22:05:51 Now go and educate yourself on why that might be. hint nothing to do with the EU and everything to do with WM. It might also be worth spending time understanding what happens when you over fish stocks, why the UK lost the cod wars to Iceland & where the majority of catches go.

It's clear you think this will fail
I think it will succeed 

Whatever! Hope your other investments  your locked into break you even soon so you can get into #GGP before the boat sails 
154 2018-06-26 22:02:19 You did super well today. Are you making a living trading stocks or are you doing this while doing your day job?
155 2018-06-26 22:01:56 Usually in cash or TDs(CDs for the rest of the world). Sometimes I'll buy more stock for my  businesses if there's a  fast turnaround on that product. Or pick stocks if I see a good opportunity. Depends on the time frame.

166 2018-06-26 21:51:47 Yes, because so many Trump supporters have loads of stocks and shares.
167 2018-06-26 21:51:23 Why do you spread lies?  Any president of honor and integrity would not try to divide the country as you do.  You’ve destroyed the Republican Party, made them laughing stocks.  You constantly violate ethical rules, you’re a sick joke made on this great country.
168 2018-06-26 21:51:02 I'm currently stalking an entry point in $BTE. Actually put a bid in today, but then the news came out and all oil stocks popped. Would have been earlier, but it's been kind of in the penalty box after the merger. Personally I loved $RRX and BTE pre-merger, so I'm all over it.
169 2018-06-26 21:50:46 I used to trade stocks before trading crypto. When I go back to trading stocks that’s going to feel like a walk in the park.
170 2018-06-26 21:50:11 You have ignored the FACT that GH has such a small shareholding but what happened last year us PJ and GH and their cronies were pumping GGP BS prior to the Newmont BS. They are looking to cash in on their free options to the Greater Fool.

175 2018-06-26 21:46:55 Brilliant!! Your stocks are rising further !!
176 2018-06-26 21:46:41 Actually guys your timing is all wrong. If I was going to deramps a share I would wait until the SP dropped, then my arguments might sound real... not while the sp is raising 

Unless you want the SP lower to get back in?!?

190 2018-06-26 21:38:49 "In extremely bullish / bearish times,investors should keep an eye on the 52-week high/low chart
In panicky markets, whenever the number of stocks hitting yearly lows versus stocks  hitting yearly highs is close to 40 or 50:1, price correction abates, markets tend to bottom out"
191 2018-06-26 21:38:49 Can we agree that the SP will rise on drill results? Or do you think this will flop?
192 2018-06-26 21:37:36 You shouldn’t be losing $100+ because large cap stocks move often slow and are wild spikes. Not always at least.

193 2018-06-26 21:36:31 Did u buy in for a LTH last year whilst those who didn't believe the hype cashed in? Looks like you are being taken in again. Fools and money spring to mind. @gervaiseheddle isn't taken in as he has bought so few shares in the open market. #tradeAIM
194 2018-06-26 21:36:22 so..... we are no longer talking about guns and mass shootings at schools, and bump stocks and the insanity of the NRA.  This is exactly what the nut bag right wants.  We are playing right into their hand.  Which is why they are winning.

214 2018-06-26 21:26:31 BOGUS!
1 Oil stocks ALL TIME HIGHS or like $XLE near 4 year highs
2 BUT oil price still 40% off AND reserves sold off to deleverage, so equities WAY OVERPRICED
3 $XLE is half $XOM (flat)+ $CVX (New co. now)...whoever uses this?
4 $EOG is higher than all time high silly
215 2018-06-26 21:25:28 Athabasca Oil was one of my best trades of the year but I sold at $1.88 after it was made a top pick on BNN.  I will look to return if they report a strong Q2. Lots of potential w/ new pipelines.  Could really see $ATH.to and most Canadian stocks start a real bull run soon.
216 2018-06-26 21:25:18 I have made very good money out of GGP so why should I hate them? I suggest you open your eyes and you do more research, I know what I know through the experience. .....also the so called nugget find was predicted a long time ago as their next spoof to raise cash,you will learn
217 2018-06-26 21:25:10 #GGP fact is the news flow will push this higher over the next few months so you have 3 options guys:

1. Buy in as a LTH for the mega bucks
2. Buy in for a quick few
3. Continue to hate on and provide nothing but negatively as you watch others cashing in


218 2018-06-26 21:24:53 Why not re inaugurate Trump now? 1 on 1 or 3 way Bloomberg will reelect Trump which since his stocks went up is probably what he wants

228 2018-06-26 21:16:12 Probably because you're whining about this issue. Don't forget we did a compromise issue in 86. Dems stabbed us in the back. So this time? No. Deport or Imprison.

232 2018-06-26 21:14:09 Exploration company which cannot explore  without raising money and just look at the amount of shares and options issued. ...tells you a story right there. .... 1 in 3000 mining prospects are viable that alone should give you enough red flags
233 2018-06-26 21:13:47 I don't know who's making decisions for that company but they're wrong. As a Harley owner myself, the pride of it was that it was American made. Anybody own stocks? Short them, fast!
234 2018-06-26 21:13:33 @jschultzf3 it seems like when volatility increases stocks are dropping and puts are getting more expensive.
Do calls also get more expensive with increasing vol?
235 2018-06-26 21:11:04 Dow closes below 200-day MA for 2nd straight day. First time in 501 days.

238 2018-06-26 21:08:40 If #GGP is such a good company why has the CEO @gervaiseheddle only bought 4.35m or 0.1% of the total shares in the company and those he last bought was on 230817. No doubt will be relying on his options of which amount to millions of shares.
239 2018-06-26 21:07:34 You are in no position to argue about the way perfectly reasonable tweets are worded. I suggest you hang patiently in the stocks and accept the rotten fruit and veg that is hurled at you with as much grace as possible.

Nobody really understands but we live by the ups and downs of these numbers.
268 2018-06-26 20:56:31 Hi Hayley, as our stocks are so low at the moment, we are prioritising regular donors. They are more likely to be able to donate for sure and we already know if they have a blood group which has particularly low stocks. 1/2
269 2018-06-26 20:55:47 @jimcramer What is your preferred time snapshot when evaluating a stocks MACD, 1M, 3M, 1Y? The data often conflicts.  #madmoney #cramerica
270 2018-06-26 20:54:56 I’d also say: the fact the the economy is doing well, or that stocks are up, or that he might have a couple of good ideas every once in a while - or that he’s responding to some real grievances - doesn’t change this.
271 2018-06-26 20:53:47 Tax havens report huge capital shares, which can come from either (i) a huge capital stock, (ii) profit shifting. What we find is that (i) cannot explain their high capital shares, because it's not the case they have higher capital stocks than non-havens
272 2018-06-26 20:52:49 @NicolleDWallace when trump tweets negatively on a US company or his tariff war, who is shorting stocks making money!
273 2018-06-26 20:52:43 Yesterday was as much or more about tech stocks! How long have pundits been talking about trade tariffs wars? I prefer Trump being outwardly open as opposed to making back door deals that only insiders are aware of like in the past
274 2018-06-26 20:52:10 The best part of your list is 10 of 12 are directly affiliated with the deep state. The other 2 (Swalwell + Lieu) are the dumbest minions to ever walk this earth.  Neither one has any self awareness or political future. Both are laughing stocks, even in their own party.

281 2018-06-26 20:46:23 Why does Corrupt Scott Pruitt still have a job? Why is Sec of Commerce Wilbur Ross insider trading? What stocks does Trump own? Why did he lie about divesting? Why are you still stealing babies & hiding them around the country? What kind of man are you?
282 2018-06-26 20:45:31 Trade war allows his mobligarchy to profit off of shorting stocks since they knew a tariff announcement would drop stocks temporarily. Everything POTUS does is to benefit himself and those he owes like Semion Moglevich.  America doesn't even rank, let alone first.

325 2018-06-26 20:22:20 Yeah man thanks. And what I meant is that the last time I did any serious transactions was about a year ago but since year I only looked at the portfolio and spent the dividends on new stocks and looking to receive more dividends as well to grow the portfolio.

330 2018-06-26 20:19:09 And my own personal rule of thumb (not everyones criteria) is I only buy stocks that pay a dividend
331 2018-06-26 20:18:30 Buy and hold works for Warren Buffet because he buys stocks that pay dividends! You're not compounding interest in crypto with buy and hold.

362 2018-06-26 20:05:31 The good thing is that the market as a whole is fickle so it doesn't take long for it all to change and for everyone to become positive again.  If anything it happens even quicker in the crypto markets compared to stocks/shares.

636 2018-06-26 17:29:16 Bounce in the stock market so far seems a touch weak to me....many stocks nearing a down sloping 20 period moving average above the price on the 1-hourt chart....this will be the key place to see if the move gains strength or falters. More likely direction for now is down....

639 2018-06-26 17:28:15 The key point here is 'Eligible' stocks are not available for delivery, so should not be included in the chart

For all we know those stocks could be 'long-term' allocations, where the owner has no intention of releasing them into the market

644 2018-06-26 17:26:29 If a person can tell you about the lastest gossip but can’t provide any insight on real estate, stocks, inspiration or creative ideas to make money treat them kind and tune them out their hurting you not helping
645 2018-06-26 17:25:47 These corrupt ppl should inspire us to bring back the stocks. We can walk past them and throw tomatoes, rotten food at them.  Public shaming under guard. No comfort for them from anyone either!
646 2018-06-26 17:24:46 Todays' column on "mom and pop ... stoners" is is so misleading. It looks more like an attempt by the "professional smart money" to manipulate Canadian cannabis in order to scare mom and pop to sell while the pros pick up the stocks cheaper.
647 2018-06-26 17:24:43 I remember the photo of DF standing next to the visible cooper on the surface. Tried looking for it but can't find it online. Think it was used by Zac Mir on the video where DF shows the computer model

China's Shanghai Composite is down 22.8% from its late-January peak - officially entering its 4th bear market in 3 years - as Trade Wars (for now) are weighing heavier on China than US markets.

668 2018-06-26 17:17:05 That was the way markets used to work but as Greg points out the returns from bonds doesn’t even cover inflation. It doesn’t make sense to be in bonds now and I agree with Greg this is being engineered to drive people into stocks.

672 2018-06-26 17:15:32 Doesn't seem apposite. The thread was about Central American immigrants, so stocks of Mexican immigrants would seem irrelevant. Better context would be stocks of Central American immigrants and/or stock of immigrants without reference to origin.

689 2018-06-26 17:08:28 Trump’s tariffs are not only economically stupid, they’re politically stupid. If Trump would quit intervening, stocks would soar and many independents, who won’t admit it, would probably vote GOP in November. Repubs are going to be stuck with true believers and Dems will win big.
690 2018-06-26 17:08:25 Quite a month, and congrats on the Orwell Prize Carole!

Interesting thought for you: what are these funds' positions leading up to March 2019? If they're planning short positions on the pound or UK stocks, that would be very revealing and in the public interest to know...

718 2018-06-26 16:54:49 I think you are missing the point: last year rise was based on speculation of a deal with Newmont

The rise now is from results and sustained cause of value added in resources in the ground

Are you saying that all positive results published in RNS's are ramps?

760 2018-06-26 16:32:24 I agree it helps to research and then it would be apparent that the shares rose 87% on 11 Oct after Multiple Gold Targets Identified at Ernest Giles East. So it's not completely different.  And ggp are being ramped for a reason

1069 2018-06-26 14:27:04 Exactly. And higher rates can hurt corporate earnings and/or lead to recession; all reasons to be cautious on stocks!

1124 2018-06-26 14:04:59 The markets are reacting to these tariffs and economic uncertainty, especially the tech stocks. In addition the pullback on foreign investment in the US by China and others as these countries retaliate against Trump’s whimsical economic policies.

1127 2018-06-26 14:03:16 Stocks are stable and bonds turned negative.  This gives the Greenback some support, but I fear there may be some Dollar unloading as we approach month's end.

1137 2018-06-26 14:00:16 A traditional 60/40 asset allocation to stocks and bonds may no longer be enough to meet long-term investment goals. Alternatives can lower volatility, enhance returns and reduce drawdowns for a portfolio.

1278 2018-06-26 12:59:00 - Chinese stocks entered a bear market as concerns mount over a U.S. trade war.

1302 2018-06-26 12:44:42 Under Obama, the market steadily increased because he kept interest rates artificially low which made stocks the best investment. When Trump was elected, the markets had a large increase do to optimism of a Prez. who would create a far better business environment.

1320 2018-06-26 12:33:30 Like a lot of companies, Harley was hit hard by the Bush/Obama depression, I sometimes wonder if that whole event was orchestrated for the sole purpose of rich globalist elites buying up company stocks for pennies on the dollar!
1321 2018-06-26 12:32:21 At some point the shift from active to passive will slow and stop.  That will leave stocks in passive portfolios rich to ones in active portfolios.  When that happens active will outperform.  It may happen a little sooner cuz markets anticipate.  When will that happen?  Soonish!

1338 2018-06-26 12:20:55 There are a lot of silent supporters. 3/4 of my household like Trump, although, they are getting tired of his rhetoric and when the stocks fall and it hits their pockets, they tend to like him less and less. Hitting the pocketbook is always a red line.

1345 2018-06-26 12:16:45 Just kidding. When I look at the monthlies (Top40), I'm bullish. But the monthly StochRSI still has to complete the down cycle first and when it turns up, I'll follow. There are a couple of stocks I'll hold for that, but I trade daily.

1394 2018-06-26 11:47:41 The numbers are only good if you are 1%. Most of us aren't. Wages have not risen, growth is lower than BHO last year in office, and stocks are falling as the trade war ruins us. Wake up and smell the fear, it is real and the US can only be fooled so long.

1525 2018-06-26 10:19:56 The thing is,in a falling market people look for stocks which won’t erode their capital much. Such an approach further increases the premium for quality. People forget that stocks are bought for returns, not for safety of capital.

1604 2018-06-26 09:21:06 Inflation is like a hidden tax because its effects go unnoticed. Hypothetically, earning 4% in a savings account while inflation grows at 7% makes you feel 4% richer, while in fact you are 3% poorer. Invest in fixed deposits whose return is above inflation and in stocks.

1615 2018-06-26 09:14:08 Its wrong measure to use IMO - that's *stocks* of immigration (so the accumulated outcome of decades of immigration flows), and also it treats all imms as equally politically salient, which is implausible (imms from poorer or more ethnically distinct countries more salient)

1711 2018-06-26 07:57:46 With the way that Reagan changed how corporate CEO's receive compensation via stock options, that has been the biggest reason why we have such economic inequality.

1896 2018-06-26 05:16:23 Stocks are retreating heavily as the trade war spates between U.S. and China escalates. This is good for long term investors!! You should use this opportunity to build up positions on the cheap

1898 2018-06-26 05:15:46 I don’t buy stocks on recommendation. I have a SIP with them though.
1899 2018-06-26 05:14:35 Ah ok... MOSL have been terrible for me too ! They have suggested some really shitty stocks in the past for me. Learning slowly. Are you also a victim of them ? 
1900 2018-06-26 05:13:20 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1901 2018-06-26 05:12:54 $DECN fell apart today so I sold for a loss. Ugly. Sold $AQB as a big red candle was forming. Clean house for Summer pot stocks bottoming out.

1903 2018-06-26 05:07:03 Tech stocks were taken out the back of the woodshed and cremated. But could this be a buying opportunity, or is the market going to slide further? With tRump's ignorant trade/tarriff's policy, I say we're not in a good place. Where ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be wise.
1904 2018-06-26 05:05:34 We can fish. The directive for quotas was to protect stocks or there would be no fish to fish. The quotas worked because now cod stocks have increased.

2018 2018-06-26 03:38:51 Chinese stocks fall as the yuan falls. Holding stocks is a proxy for currency. And contrary to expectations, when the US dollar rises higher, US stocks will rise with it. Don't be fooled--the end of the current financial system is not the end of the USD itself. Not with Trump.

2052 2018-06-26 03:16:53 Anyone with more than a few 1000 (2017) dollars to spare would probably invest in stocks or gold certificates even back then, rather than buying the actual metal and keep it in their sock drawer or so.

I suspect July 2nd/3rd/4th will allow for some profit taking and a shift of wealth to stocks that had great Anns in June. Also looking forward to those that somehow held off news until July.
;D
2278 2018-06-26 00:38:22 So do we short GM now? That’s how this works right? I’m confused... oh wait the stocks already trash. Got it.
2279 2018-06-26 00:37:57 They guy doing the videos on Exam Zone for Series 6 sounds like Nick Offerman. I feel like I’m learning about stocks from Ron Swanson.
2280 2018-06-26 00:37:50 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr This country is falling apart.  Companies are leaving the US to go to other countries because of Trump's tariffs.  Stocks are falling, Prices Rising.  Soon people will be starving!  Hurry you need to act now to save this country!
2281 2018-06-26 00:37:30 My IRAs 401ks and stocks have been making a lot money. Does anybody think it was better with Obama. Trump is making is all money . Under Obama it was slooooooow
2282 2018-06-26 00:35:40 Stocks are just starting their bull run! Strap on tight! Trump will make them go higher with this trade war!!
2283 2018-06-26 00:35:23 Isn't it sad we have the most open forums for debate in social media yet the discourse has been reduced to arguments, tit for tat bitching and a tool for shaming people-like digital stocks!
2284 2018-06-26 00:35:08 Yeah, dropping stocks really fire up that old optimism.
2285 2018-06-26 00:34:50 You don’t seem to realize that you’re gambling with someone else’s money. You wanted to play hardball & the world powers are responding accordingly. Stocks falling, tariffs rising. You’re over your head, Donnie. #sad

2287 2018-06-26 00:32:35 Trump issues trade tariffs. Apple’s largest market is in China. Their stock price will plummet. I’ll take all $150.75 that I have in my savings and buy all apple stocks. In a few years, when all this shit settles, I’ll be rich.
2288 2018-06-26 00:32:07 Sold all of my stocks in my 401k months ago when dopey Trump started threatening the tariffs.
2289 2018-06-26 00:31:46 What’s some stocks y’all are lookin at? Maybe get some share in ?
2290 2018-06-26 00:31:24 Hey man, what exchange do you trade on for stocks?
2291 2018-06-26 00:31:07 Is there an Australian drag store that stocks Sasha Velour merch? I want her punk patch but I don't want to pay $25 shipping for a $6 product.
2292 2018-06-26 00:30:59 Holy stocks! #stocks
2293 2018-06-26 00:29:14 Technically a stick can be used to makeshift a bump stock so that’s not going to stop the problem. We have a mental health issue in this country as well as a gun issue that needs to be addressed more than just with bump stocks.
2294 2018-06-26 00:29:13 We added 255000 jobs just in May! And stocks are always volatile be patient:) Average tax cuts saw avg Americans get a pay raise.
2295 2018-06-26 00:28:13 By the way nobodys laughing at the stocks, they are all crying like you are son
2296 2018-06-26 00:27:51 Why? What are bump stocks? What do they do?
2297 2018-06-26 00:27:17 Stocks plummet, tax reform only brought money to the rich, economy was doing great under Obama, now in a tailspin, companies (and jobs) fleeing the country. When will your Trumpites see the harm you are doing? It’s getting more and more obvious.
2298 2018-06-26 00:27:16 Bitch you go for grabs as zss 2 stocks behind at 100% against rage falcon
2299 2018-06-26 00:27:12 Q2 GDP is projected at 2.9% on the low end and 4% on the high end. Even at the low end, that puts GDP at double the level when Trump took office. If you think there's a crash coming, then sell your stocks. I'll enjoy laughing later at your decision
2300 2018-06-26 00:27:07 They manipulate stocks at will, but the Red Hen is just being pissy about finding out what's good for the goose is good for the gander. As my gma always said!
2301 2018-06-26 00:26:53 Is trumps plan to depress stock prices down and a select few step in and buy up the stocks giving them control of many Companies?
2302 2018-06-26 00:22:50 Important note: There are very large short position in lots of bankrupt stocks, usually easy to keep borrowed. And who wants to pay taxes by closing the position?
2303 2018-06-26 00:21:43 Hello? Stocks are up. And about as far from a crash as they can be with the underlying fundamental economy booming now we have strengthening fundamentals underlining a broader array of industries and not just low interest rates providing oxygen to stocks
2304 2018-06-26 00:21:13 This is just because of your dad's propoganda. The stock market is down since January. You know it. You have stocks.
2305 2018-06-26 00:20:30 Some of the hottest technology stocks on the market suffered a sudden reversal Monday morning, amid reports of new efforts to block Chinese investment in and sales to U.S. tech firms and doubts about rising valuations for tech firms.
2306 2018-06-26 00:20:13 Aussie shares off to a softer start for a 3rd day on US-China-EU trade tensions. #ASX 200 -40pts or -0.66% to 6169. Utilities & property stocks up, all other sectors under pressure. Miners down most while banks easing #ausbiz
2307 2018-06-26 00:19:44 Comments with demonstrated knowledge of bump stocks would be helpful.....

2309 2018-06-26 00:18:25 I’m impulsively buying stocks when I feel like I should be impulsively buying swimsuits or $10 bath bombs
2310 2018-06-26 00:18:20 Ang boring na ng Facebook. I honestly don't know why their stocks are valued that much. Oh well, what do I know?  #ALDUBProudFanAko
2311 2018-06-26 00:17:50 Wise. Money market is a smart place to be. In uncertain times as these. I’m holding onto my pot stocks. Believing that they will do better during the upcoming recession. Natural resource stocks are a good shelter also.
2312 2018-06-26 00:16:53 Good to avoid: 

Shorting stocks 
Leverage 
Trading derivatives 
Day trading 
Timing the market 
Chasing returns 
Chasing quick money
2313 2018-06-26 00:16:29 Tech stocks took a major hit today.
2314 2018-06-26 00:16:18 Because every investment advice book or article for young investors suggests buying etf's. Only when you take a real interest in the market do you pick individual stocks.
2315 2018-06-26 00:14:23 Personne ne fume plus en ce moment ?  Faut vider les stocks  ! #weed #cannabis #beuh
2316 2018-06-26 00:14:05 Maybe we can get the money back from all of your Mar-largo guests.  You know the 1 percent  that got the REAL tax breaks and stocks buy back.
2317 2018-06-26 00:12:54 Buy Canadian Aurora stocks
2318 2018-06-26 00:11:47 Sorry, has he fixed arising insurance costs, immigration, NK, trade deals, deficits, crashing stocks, Middle East, etc? No instead he had placed tariffs killing U.S. soybeans, cheese exports, and moving HD motorcycle jobs overseas. Tax bonanza to self creating trillion$ deficit.
2319 2018-06-26 00:10:58 Can we bring back the stocks on the town square and just do some public shaming of our treasonous officials? Early American Colonists used that effectively...

2321 2018-06-26 00:10:49 Invest in property, Pay off all debt, give my #CycleforSurvival team a huge donation every year and invest in some great penny stocks & companies that I feel will be great.
2322 2018-06-26 00:10:32 Buy oil stocks
2323 2018-06-26 00:09:05 Unemployment at its lowest cuz it’s been improving for years, ever since Obama rescued the economy. Stocks have taken a dive w reckless tariff talk, and Harley will be making more motorcycles in Europe. 

And approval for #taxscam is down to 34%.

Indeed, a stable genius he.
2324 2018-06-26 00:07:25 Kind of funny being one of my worst performing stocks of the year that it would jump 10% on a brutal day otherwise. I take that to be a very good sign for AKTX.
2325 2018-06-26 00:07:09 Stocks doesn’t like uncertainty.Every time he tweets with regards anything tariffs market goes down and my 401k takes a hit. You would know this if you ever have one. And read the business news as well. I am not trying to insult anyone if my post suggest otherwise I apologize.
2326 2018-06-26 00:07:05 How are they advocating for the criminalization of mental illness by advocating for gun control? Banning bump stocks, AR-15’s and closing gun show loopholes doesn’t affect the mentally ill.
2327 2018-06-26 00:06:53 I case no one has noticed: Stock Market has been tanking for 9 days now. Our economy is tanking due to #Trump actions. He is killing our economy like the last @GOP Bush did!

2328 2018-06-26 00:06:21 Ban bump stocks.  They are a threat!
2329 2018-06-26 00:05:20 You may spend one Shiro and three Pidges every quarter. Go over that and you will be Slav in debt in all realities. Invest in a tight shirt now while stocks are reasonably priced.

2331 2018-06-26 00:04:08 Not so. Other non-CFP nations do not share water and fish with the E27. Fish stocks move around. Any new arrangement will have to involve close agreement and co-operation with EU.
