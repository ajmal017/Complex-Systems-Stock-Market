87 2018-08-07 23:15:10 Same, about mostly dealing with stocks without dividends.

I often find buybacks create a floor, as if the company steps in and buys below a target price.

And good point that even if their market cap doesn’t grow the share price will increase (less shares), also beneficial.
88 2018-08-07 23:15:09 Oh no. Public means stockholders own pieces of the company & those stocks can be traded. All these stock holders (owners) are PRIVATE citizens, i.e. not the government. This is basic high school economics.

94 2018-08-07 23:10:17 I agree with what you say! I would also prefer the dividend raise! The thing is that I deal mostly with stocks that don't pay dividends.

Buybacks remove shares from the public which effectively raises the share price. Think about it like a reverse dilution

130 2018-08-07 22:40:26 It’s not about how good she is. It’s about her ability to steal stocks no matter the percents. Id be fine with her if she actually had to bring her opponents to somewhat high percents to kill them smh.
131 2018-08-07 22:40:22 These are the 2 stocks in energy sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$EMR, $PSX

133 2018-08-07 22:38:48 We'd be like WE GOTTA FEED THE FAMILY "But they don't have kids" THEY WILL *stocks surprisingly rise*
134 2018-08-07 22:38:23 Those aren’t penny stocks lmao. That sounds like a lottery
135 2018-08-07 22:38:17 "Those who show it better prove they know it better" (Like OS on stocks, long may you reign)

So, too, w/ the car.  Thought same as you; drove in one.  Shit thee not, DECIDEDLY quieter and, sounds nuts, smooth as a RR!  It's why we bought one to match r 1,200 shares. ThxAgn4Opt's
136 2018-08-07 22:38:16 No kidding genius. Have you ever in your short life seen a short seller talk up a stock? What’s your illness?

140 2018-08-07 22:32:52 You want to know why capitalism really isn’t fair?  I’m sort of good at stocks and got a little lucky, but I make 16k today on Tesla stock.  To those who have some, more will be given.  I get your point, but I also look at Venezuela and see the other side.
141 2018-08-07 22:32:32 On most exchanges alts trade in btc terms, so when btc falls others are highly like to fall in $ terms. Btc is also the main indicator of sentiment in crypto (analogous to s&p500 for stocks) and alts can be seen as a high beta exposure to crypto

147 2018-08-07 22:28:55 I am glad you posted this - I had seen it but wasn’t sure what the impact would be - positive or negative for the stocks that are moving. You think it’s positive?  I wasn’t sure....

157 2018-08-07 22:20:19 Publicly traded. Publicly owned refers to government. Like a public park. Public utilities. Facebook is a private entity that the public can buy into via stocks. Facebook, however, is not a publicly entity. All American citizens do not have equal access to it.

161 2018-08-07 22:18:14 Heavily-shorted stocks that get acquired have a history of blowing up on the acquirers. Long, long list: QCOR > MNK a recent favorite example. My guess is that if JAB were public we would have seen it w/GMCR.
162 2018-08-07 22:17:51 don’t forget that the market largely controls stock prices but the company can influence that by issuing dividends and controlling how many individual stocks are in the market at once
163 2018-08-07 22:17:27 I have always done well over the years sorting sticks. Professional traders tend to be bears because stocks go down faster thang they go up
164 2018-08-07 22:16:06 Story stocks...investors can always stay irrational longer than you can stay short.

167 2018-08-07 22:15:07 I've been thinking about doing that but 1) I'm still learning how to buy stocks 2) idk which stocks to buy 3) I gotta put down at least a grand to buy a good stock soo
168 2018-08-07 22:14:27 funny how this came up after your tweet storm yesterday on breadth of stock market. i still think hottest growth stocks not going public until much later stage is harmful to some investors.
169 2018-08-07 22:14:25 So why should you get to decide if I can have 30 rounds or 10 rounds in a gun? Why is a 30 round mag somehow more dangerous than 29?

You can't buy an "assault rifle", NFA since 1934. 

Bump stocks, red herring. They are a gimmick, useless.
170 2018-08-07 22:13:49 Summer declines and roses have grown rare,

179 2018-08-07 22:09:29 Facebook is a private entity. Privately owned vs. Publicly owned (taxpayer funded and under the auspices of government regulation). Facebook stocks are traded on the market publicly, but that doesn't make the company "public" in your context.
180 2018-08-07 22:09:09 As I get to know some of the other uranium stocks better, it's one of the things that jumps out at me.  Frankly, does make me uncomfortable to see.  I share your views about it being a part of the mosaic.  Well put!  Thanks.

183 2018-08-07 22:07:25 CBOT Sept wht down A$4.29/t with modest drop in futures & higher A$. The spread between wht & corn could have done US farmers looking at increasing wht acres. Market weighed down by slow US exports despite tightening global stocks.
184 2018-08-07 22:06:42 This is awful though - the equivalent of being put in the stocks by the mob (phantoms inc).  Not dignified.  Dialogue not tweetfests.
185 2018-08-07 22:05:33 If somehow the LBO of Tesla is real, can’t wait for all the bearish articles calling it the ultimate sign of a top in stocks
186 2018-08-07 22:05:14 CBOT Sept wht down A$4.29/t with modest drop in futures & higher A$. The spread between wht & corn could have done US farmers looking at increasing wht acres. Market weighed down by slow US exports despite tightening global stocks.
187 2018-08-07 22:04:59 Is it fear of investors who ar shortchanging Tesla stocks? For that I suggest you you listen to what Yoda had to say.
“Fear leads to hate, hate leads to anger and anger leads to suffering”
In this case suffering of Tesla as a company and employee’s. Don’t do it

190 2018-08-07 22:03:34 But the best was there was a dude who traded stocks for a living telling her why she didn’t make sense and she was telling him he was wrong. Uh, that’s what he does for a LIVING lol

198 2018-08-07 22:01:47 Perhaps before closing, short sellers will/have to cover all the stocks loaned and cause a squeeze towards $1000 just like VW in 2008 before getting back to $420 on closing.

207 2018-08-07 21:54:34 The latter is true for me - rarely use flunixin. As I understand it we can use up the stocks that we have
208 2018-08-07 21:54:08 I wonder what your opinion on shorting stocks is. 
209 2018-08-07 21:53:59 Same here bro. I hardly trade equity because I don't have the time to monitor the performance of the market/specific stocks. I sold all my JAPAULOIL at 97kobo after 4 years. 
210 2018-08-07 21:53:57 Are we at peak #earnings for US #stocks just now, and should you be selling if that’s the case? The historical record is surprisingly unclear on that question, with stocks peaking as late as one year after an earnings high water mark. Also, we’ve had
211 2018-08-07 21:53:26 no chart is needed to prove why the @anustrader likes $TBGI (Transpacific Broadband Group) bought at .54 and now i'm sleeping like a baby with a smile on my face. #PSE #Stocks #trading

213 2018-08-07 21:52:05 No I put my money in to stocks and shares then set up funds for the grandkids paid of my mortgage and set aside a nice little sum for a rainy day that’s what pays my hols but that don’t give me any reasons to judge anyone else on benefits

215 2018-08-07 21:51:26 I see. We have dedicated Grocery teams in each store that look after tens of thousands of products. Often the CustServ team knows these details, but not always. Especially if we haven’t had any issues, complaints, or out-of-stocks from the recall.

 Slow leak of good news & information confirmed, just as expected this week.
217 2018-08-07 21:50:42 Fun Fact: All the stocks in Pulp Fiction were trading at $420 a share.
218 2018-08-07 21:49:42 No bloody way. If it's information that material, then disclosure doesn't happen from the CEO musing maybe in a tweet. That's how penny stocks get promoted (if they want to break the law).

225 2018-08-07 21:46:27 One day soon you will wake up some morning and someone will be offering a free app which you can periodically any time you wish clear all registers cos like GOOG FB etc use to push ads on you. And their stocks will be crushed.
226 2018-08-07 21:46:25 Money-losing automaker. What a devious way to discredit such a progressive and future forward company. Guessing Bloomberg likes their oil and diesel car stocks more. Why even bother running any pro environment, climate preserving institutions when your channel cant even aid $TSLA
227 2018-08-07 21:45:55 If a PE firm was gonna buy something for that much money there is literally an entire market of stocks that would be better than TSLA. Would have to be the worst deal in history.
228 2018-08-07 21:45:41 Hey Mike, @FootnotesFirst does share count play into your decision making process at all?  Would you rather own more closely held stocks, all things equal? Thanks.

230 2018-08-07 21:45:26 Trying to learn penny stocks.   How long  has AAPH. Been on your radar and how to you find it?
231 2018-08-07 21:44:21 Today, Wall Street yet again proved that when it comes to crypto, it is decidedly NOT "smart money."  If not for the Fed and PPT, they'd prove it in stocks and bonds, too.
232 2018-08-07 21:43:12 We Don’t trade stocks!
233 2018-08-07 21:43:01 That’s “if” you can still lose a lot of money with stocks or other equities. Tbills rates are discouraging but still way better than keeping your money in the bank.
234 2018-08-07 21:42:35 Trading options is far too different vs trading penny stocks. I find it really hard. I’m looking forward to learn from you.
235 2018-08-07 21:42:05 I’m sure the Saudi’s, as every other country, owns lots of stocks
236 2018-08-07 21:41:18 I can’t even imagine what would happen if Musk discovered tracking stocks
237 2018-08-07 21:40:49 U r right, at least for now, he is what u said. I think stocks will start to fall in 2019. It's why he started the trade war in 2018 that makes harder for GOP to win elections. So he can blame a Dems controlled Congress for everything next year and beyond.
238 2018-08-07 21:39:56 BUY STOCKS
239 2018-08-07 21:39:28 Oh I’m sure she noticed her stocks
240 2018-08-07 21:38:32 Hence why bump stocks are the new hot thing amongst mass shooters...... because owning automatic weapons is illegal.
241 2018-08-07 21:38:21 Book Depository stocks both editions if you prefer the US version, with free shipping. Covers are entirely the genius of the publishers and the artists concerned - the US one is derived from a beautiful graphite work by @GregRuth . i was very lucky!
242 2018-08-07 21:38:00 Jess what really make me is that fact that CWT and their Carthage Missouri plant proved the science that plastics are 100% recyclable and one of the best feed stocks! But that plant is now closed, the tech is buried in Canadian patent vaults and no one knows about any of it!
243 2018-08-07 21:37:20 The market is WAY overvalued and due for a correction, even without trade, geopolitical, as well as politics at home.  Just keep buying overpriced stocks and I will be happy to take them off your hands later.
244 2018-08-07 21:35:05 also the "number" of companies on a give market is a mediocre measure at best - it ignores mergers, the rise of markets outside of the US (which now have far more companies listed than in the past), changes at the bottom of the market (penny stocks), the rise of ETFs and more
245 2018-08-07 21:34:09 @FoxBusiness that’s what they said w/ PizzaHut—to be completely out of business. But PizzaHut is still around? Companies just love to manipulate their stocks.

247 2018-08-07 21:34:05 I sure hope we see well above .12 cents per share. Seems to me this stock if high enough could bring in hedge funds. I have seen some stocks go parabolic drone below 1.00 per share to 11.00 in 6 weeks time...

254 2018-08-07 21:29:53 And that’s wrong. Do you think that’ll last?  The lcbo only stocks what sells? The lcbo is also one of those problems. Beer should be sold in any grocery store or convenience store that wants to sell it.  Again to me, it’s about liberty.  Enough with unneeded government control.
255 2018-08-07 21:29:43 I day trade about on average 20 stocks at a time depending on the day. Still never use them. Every single day trader I know (30 or so) don’t use them either. Maybe 1 or 2 positional guys but that’s about it.
256 2018-08-07 21:29:10 Let's be honest, Kat. It was always about the butts. But 30% is actually kinda low. Maybe their stocks took a hit
257 2018-08-07 21:28:28 YOU clearly don't understand how this works.

Just because a company's STOCKS are offered publically, does not make it a "public" company. Sure, there are different laws when it comes to reporting financial details, but it has no bearing on what terms and conditions they have
258 2018-08-07 21:28:20 Moi je prends toujours 1to! Ça dépend ce que tu stocks mais ça va vite! Et franchement par rapport au prix ça vaut le coût (genre 500go c'est 50 euros, 1to c'est 60! Pas les prix exacts mais tu vois l'idée)
259 2018-08-07 21:28:18 Right. Because their stocks are private, but having your stock sold on the open market does not therefore make it a public company.
260 2018-08-07 21:27:25 So, my boyfriend and I want to start investing in stocks. We saw a YouTube video of a 24 year old who started investing and then started renting out houses and now he basically brings in over $14,000/ day. I don’t know where to start though
261 2018-08-07 21:27:16 that's somewhat utter nonsense. Investing in the market is mostly about buying existing stocks (or better yet ETFs) - IPOs have never been a good primary measure of investment in the market (occasionally as a higher risk segment of your portfolio perhaps)
262 2018-08-07 21:26:58 Those cannabis stocks are all going to collapse.
263 2018-08-07 21:26:46 Yowza. Homebuilding stocks getting killed in Q2. $OC missed by almost 20%, and now $BECN misses by 10%. I get that the real estate market may be starting to soften, but that shouldn't have THAT much effect on builders. Tariff related? Economy related?

276 2018-08-07 21:20:23 I want to add that does not mean to buy penny stocks. it’s value can be in the high negatives due to debt or otherwise. Accurately valuate a company, and pay less than the intrinisic value. Have a margin of safety in case you’re wrong. Avoid businesses you don’t understand
277 2018-08-07 21:20:17 I like to stick with my winners, stocks and people alike. Thanks for the 2 cents?

280 2018-08-07 21:18:49 Why tf is it every time I buy stocks or options in companies before their earnings release, one will delay and one I wanna buy next will drop them early?

282 2018-08-07 21:18:35 @CNBC There are more Stocks than #Tesla. Most us don't GAS, because the company is the biggest POS on the planet. Watching #Fox-business because you are obviously FAKE news like all NBC channels.
283 2018-08-07 21:18:08 Aunt Sam comes from money herself. I guess people missed her conversation with Brett about how they were alike in many ways. How she has blue chip stocks and money market accts. She said her family is very very frugal (cheap). Her grandfather made a lot money. #bb20
284 2018-08-07 21:17:59 I don't understand why it is 'Islamophobic' to support a burka ban. Last year Morocco, where Islam is the state religion, not only banned the burka but also made it illegal to sell, import or even promote it. Retailers were given 48 hours to destroy all their stocks.
285 2018-08-07 21:17:20 Facebook is not a public business. It's privately owned, and simply publicly traded.

Owning Facebook stocks doesn't give you any decisional power whatsoever, unless you sit on the board as well.

Maybe you should try and google the difference?
286 2018-08-07 21:17:09 You are confused about what the words mean.  Facebook is a privately owned company that trades its stocks publicly...on the stock exchange.  Unlike your post office which doesn't, because it has no stocks
287 2018-08-07 21:16:54 @Millie__Weaver 1.) people from diverse political views criticized you, not just “progressives” 2.) The wiki source you posted was about stocks, don’t try to twist this 3.) a private organization open to the public =/= a public owned entity

296 2018-08-07 21:12:14 Just curious- how have tariffs rattled the financial markets?  US stocks are less than 1% from all time highs.  I still think Wall Street and big business love Trump.  They are not going to let the market fall unless something dramatic happens

Lower high setups or rejections of big resistance.
300 2018-08-07 21:11:38 Stocks and bonds are rallying together while the breadth lags. Leadership is still in defensive sectors. Stocks should be near a pull back here at least, but I would still like to see Dow Jones hitting new highs last to seal a top. $DJX

345 2018-08-07 20:59:23 I don't think he and his company have paid much taxes, that's why he is so rich. His money is in stocks so he doesn't lose money by not selling his stocks.

348 2018-08-07 20:58:41 $DIS gets all the after hours losses back and is now trading in the green.  Sentiment towards the stock is often more important than the numbers themselves.  Loved stocks often bounce on disappointing reports.
349 2018-08-07 20:57:34 These companies have stockholders. If those stockholders feel differently,they may suffer from stocks being dumped-what is now happening with Facebook. The CEO & board making decision 4 the stockholders,the public? Besides they act as publisher & editor.

353 2018-08-07 20:55:39 Can’t you still hold on to stocks if they privatise? Elon was talking about something like that.
354 2018-08-07 20:55:23 Implied volatility maybe kind of the secret. I am screening Stocks and ETFs for IV above 40 using the tastyworks platform, then "handpicking" spreads and condors by playing with strikes and expiration, looking for near 50/50 chances. DTE 50-90 and closing about 50% profit
355 2018-08-07 20:55:08 Wow, very well said. It's sad that in today's world it's necessary to take steps like this to keep destructive business models out... Shorting stocks and then trying to destroy the companies simply is perverse... Therefore shorting should be illegal IMHO. @elonmusk @Tesla
356 2018-08-07 20:54:59 Facebook is a corporation that is owned by shareholders that acquire stocks on the public stock market. It is not publicly owned like, say, a utility. They have the right to enforce their rules as they and their shareholders see fit so long as no laws are broken. None were.
357 2018-08-07 20:54:38 FX SUMMARY: AUD RALLIED HIGHER YESTERDAY AFTER RBA AS 'RISK ON' TOOK HOLD WITH ASIAN STOCKS HIGHER PARTICULARLY THE SHANG AND HANG SENG UP 2% ON THE DAY. THE MOVE HAS RUN OUT OF STEAM AHEAD OF 0.7440 BUT EXPECT SUPPORT TODAY 0.7400-10. BELOW 0.7385/90 WOULD BE BEARISH FOR THE AUD
358 2018-08-07 20:51:40 So, when did you fail out of econ 101? 

Facebook is not government property. You can buy stocks in it, yes, but that has nothing to do with it being a private business vs a government (public) entity.
359 2018-08-07 20:51:35 Did a homework thing over last week. 5 stocks (1 I bought #TLY) most tweeted stocks.. the bid has fallen from last week on 4 of them. Yet they still get pumped.

361 2018-08-07 20:50:42 There's no such thing as a public business, genius.  "Publicly Traded" means that shares are available FOR SALE on stock exchanges. These stocks are privately owned.

Publicly traded companies answer to these shareholders NOT THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

395 2018-08-07 20:38:32 And the next day the manufacture sells bump stocks disassembled as individual piece bypassing the ban proving “feel good” measures need realistic thought processes.

405 2018-08-07 20:35:21 It's still privately owned by those that buy stocks. It's not public insofar that it's owned by a municipality, county, state or country. Taxpayers don't fund it, therefore it's not public but private property. Facebook is publicly traded on the stock exchange for private profit.

420 2018-08-07 20:30:50 Publicly traded company has to do with stocks, not ownership. First amendment censorship only applies to the government.

besides, where was the out rage over the cakes. It’s like y’all are selective or something.
421 2018-08-07 20:30:37 Funny you say this but wages are actually down since he got in office. The tax breaks for the corporations allowed them to not hire more people but instead they are buying back their own stocks creating a bubble in the stock market. When it pops will Trump be taking credit?

فهناك جزء من الشعب يعنقد أن ما حدث في تركيا من نمو إقتصادي هو في حقيقته فقاعة ستنفجر في القريب العاجل 
وهذا يؤثر على الإستثمار الداخلي
424 2018-08-07 20:29:48 And also, aren't you _already_ tilting towards low-vol stocks thanks to the Adj. Slope implementation? Because we're still within the same asset class it shouldn't be as important and it'd probably (depending on rebalance frequency) generate excess transaction costs & spread.
425 2018-08-07 20:29:32 I hope you guys know FB lost tons of money in stocks the very day they did this to you.  I'm sure their is no correlation. Lol

432 2018-08-07 20:26:15 I'm a gun owner, hunter, veteran and former NRA member. Your organization lost all credibility. Civilians should not have access to 30 round magazines, assault rifles, bump stocks, silencers, etc. If you can't admit that, you don't deserve a gun.
433 2018-08-07 20:25:55 As an investor (esp with stocks) your last sources of advantage are often micro knowledge and long term orientation. Not sure why people still day trade.
434 2018-08-07 20:25:48 The short sellers are eating this stocks potential up
435 2018-08-07 20:25:26 I'm sorry , there are some people in this world who deserve a place in the stocks. @KayBurley has now confirmed she is one thing of them.

436 2018-08-07 20:24:53 Those tax breaks making you rich? U 1 of the m/billionaires investing in stocks in their own companies, u Wilbur Ross stealing millions, or r u a teacher buying your own school supplies while Betsy DeVos has to make do with only 9 of her 10 yachts.

445 2018-08-07 20:22:48 World stocks higher: US +.3%; Europe +.5%. For another day, solid earnings reports outweighed trade fears. Investors underestimating risk of tariffs on stocks. As prices rise, risk rises as does probability of volatility spike. Market could still rise a bit but not too much more.

449 2018-08-07 20:20:39 Cannabis stocks are one of the best investments in Canada right now. My town has a thousand new jobs and a thousand more on the way. Your outdated fear of pot is ridiculous.
450 2018-08-07 20:20:31 Tesla going pvt! Thoughts? I'm clueless when it comes to stocks etc but if I had the free cash I'd probably buy a share or two for a rainy day 
451 2018-08-07 20:20:10 Everyone goes thru the same market lessons. Up to oneself to learn from it. Seldom if ever, "different" this time around esp. when it comes to parabolic jr. stocks' sp moves based mostly on speculation upon either resources play or future earnings profile or if company TO worthy.
452 2018-08-07 20:20:07 $TSLA wow, goes public at around $30 and trying to go private at $420... funding apparently secured, big name IB’s and shareholders say shares are worth at least $570... what a time to be alive and in the markets... I may not sleep for a while #stocks
453 2018-08-07 20:19:40 No! I'm saying DFO have not been very effective in helping to ensure the wild stocks are protected and now we face ever dwindling numbers. Fish farms should be land based and their droppings turned into fertilizer. Of course uncontrolled climate change will negate all efforts.

457 2018-08-07 20:18:31 What about IQ? Loading up on TCEHY for the move to $62. This stock is absurdly under priced. Wall Street has no love for Chinese stocks. IQ also.

Nasdaq and S&P both +0.3%. 
S&P ends just 0.5% below record high reached in Jan.

463 2018-08-07 20:17:22 I don’t know the details on Colmex but I have heard of traders trading some low floats on high volume days - in any case, the guy asking was from India so even with limits on some stocks this may be his best option - hope he see this or @modern_rock can pass on the info

465 2018-08-07 20:17:09 Trading #stocks is hard. A tweet by a crazy person can kill a position in the blink of an eye. A stock can blow away an earnings number & tank because they missed a made up  “whisper” number that regular folk like me don’t hear. Better 2 #invest in a diverse, low cost fund or ETF

508 2018-08-07 19:55:44 timto tweetem jsi mi udelal radost... opravdu. Nejde o to, ze jsem byl short (cover po earnings report), ale uz jsem mel pocit, ze to nikdo nevidi, ze se svet opravdu zblaznil.
509 2018-08-07 19:55:26 The speculative nature of market values in or trading system only hurts the consumer. While stocks and bonds are great instruments of business the much needed regulation of Wall St. is needed even more.
510 2018-08-07 19:55:13 stay in that monogamous relationship young king. save that condom money and invest it in stocks. it's rough out here.
511 2018-08-07 19:54:41 Buy @Tesla stocks, taytel

Just do it!
512 2018-08-07 19:54:16 That’s because they have been tanking their own fund by rebalancing and selling down all their holdings. They are supposedly done and the stocks should begin recovering and tracking back to their spot market correlation.

515 2018-08-07 19:52:49 Setting aside conversations of legality as not my area of expertise...his timing was spot on. Why can't stocks am long have managers as adept at driving share price higher opportunistically?
516 2018-08-07 19:52:12 My friends: married/divorced/plural, kids, home owners, retirement plans, stocks, bonds, investments 

Me: ohhhhh I was supposed to take it out of the wrapper before microwaving
517 2018-08-07 19:51:51 When did you start trading options? You have been a short the penny stocks guy for years. FB puts day after the quarterly earnings report was the first I ever heard you talk about options. How many years of experience do you have with option trading and spreads?
518 2018-08-07 19:51:24 As one segment gets wealthier and wealthier it makes it harder on the population that doesn’t own stocks. This fact is lost on those watching @FoxNews - even as they struggle to pay their bills.
519 2018-08-07 19:51:14 "Public" as opposed to "private enterprise" and "publicly traded" are two different uses of the word "public" with distinct meanings. Everone involved with stocks knows this. Arguing otherwise makes it sound like you have no idea what you're talking about.
520 2018-08-07 19:49:59 At 52 bushels to get that ending stocks number demand would have to increase significantly in this report. That’s about 2 bushels above the trade estimates.... Not everyone grows crops in Dresden... 
521 2018-08-07 19:49:22 Over 10K traded stocks. Why is everyone getting their tail in a knot over 1.
522 2018-08-07 19:49:20 Snapchat has an ad to invest in marijuana stocks and I’ve been wanting to look how to invest. Is this destiny telling me what to do?
523 2018-08-07 19:49:14 I don't know jack about stocks but I know Teala will rule future auto and energy markets.  So it sounds like I can keep my share? Should I buy more to hold through this transition? Am I big enough to hold stares when it goes from public to private? Do I need a CPA now to stay?
524 2018-08-07 19:48:41 @Fishtight Some advice please Keith. Small Zander have been found in our small river. Should we return them or not being an invasive species? Some club members are concerned for fish stocks.
525 2018-08-07 19:48:33 If #tesla #tsla doesn't go private, great pump con by @elonmusk #stocks
@business @cnbc @msnbc @CNNMoney
526 2018-08-07 19:48:19 $TSLA can all stocks please halt for TSLA news.  lol.
527 2018-08-07 19:47:56 fans are upset about the relationship i’ve seen tweets etc with my own eyes, the only thing undoing their hard work are ‘fans’ telling edawn to leave, cancelling their tickets and having cube’s stocks drop
528 2018-08-07 19:47:56 How about more in paychecks, bonus, stocks doing great.  And pride that I buy everything I want because I earn it. Not because somebody else pays for me to have them.  So how exactly does that make me a traitor?  Because I want better for myself and my family?  Try it.
529 2018-08-07 19:47:45 $netc $5.5 mil transactions in July (NR on 20th). With the launch of Quint, and renewed consumer interest in crypto (starbucks), I suspect August will be a busy month. #tech #crypto #stocks #cse #tsxv #tsx @Netcoins
530 2018-08-07 19:47:30 End of quotas = the return of depleted fish stocks.
We learnt in the 70s that you can't just take as many fish as you want and still expect them to be there for the next generation.
531 2018-08-07 19:47:16 Dear @StokesSauces could you give a thought to your labels please. My @waitrose stocks the ketchup and the chipotle next to one another and for the second time I am home with the wrong one. The labels are so similar.
532 2018-08-07 19:47:13 My whole offices panties are so wet about Tesla’s stocks 
533 2018-08-07 19:47:13 Yeah but isn't the writing on the wall? If the market enters a slowdown and rates keep going up investors will start to seek safety and that means selling stocks like Tesla.
534 2018-08-07 19:46:32  yahoo stocks just went up
535 2018-08-07 19:46:14 Aggregate stats look great, but fact of the matter is that median American holds less stocks than 20 years and didn’t benefit from 2009-18 bull market. Aggregates can be misleading
536 2018-08-07 19:46:03 Savings as in stocks? Or saving as in flow? Saving as a flow is a not a source of finance--it is the post fact assignment of wealth that is already created in endogenous money/credit economy. Savings glut as a stock makes no sense either.
537 2018-08-07 19:45:18 Some guy from Motley Fool bashed #aphria #aph and cannabis stocks in general. I bought some more shares today for 2019 profits
538 2018-08-07 19:44:35 fursuits can be okay, don't go to the nintendo stocks
539 2018-08-07 19:44:21 Maybe there is something to public punishment... like the old stocks where  the head and hands are visible, and trapping the person.. wouldn't you toss a rotten tomato at his head? Show your children how NOT to be, and teach consequences for words and actions.
540 2018-08-07 19:43:59 $LOCMQ holding well so far. I think it could go more imo
541 2018-08-07 19:43:11 Should I invest in stocks and mutual fund? 
542 2018-08-07 19:42:37 w/ all due respect I am a subscriber, have u ever seen a CEO w/ Cult like attributes? it's billionaires who worship this Liberal, @ least I can book some losses this yr. Trading stocks is tough business, that's y many don't participate
543 2018-08-07 19:42:20 I'm sorry you didn't hear that those have been debunked and that the economy is growing to fast, unemployment rates for all is at an all time low, taxes are going down, stocks at an all time high, wages are going up and bonuses were given out
544 2018-08-07 19:41:51 It's not just stock ideas. It's knowledge/coaching/training that sets us apart.  #stocks
545 2018-08-07 19:41:18 Almost makes me wish I traded stocks.
546 2018-08-07 19:41:16 Kali-co brought me a shitton to replenish my stocks even tho they roast me all the technology updates i just.
547 2018-08-07 19:40:17 Exactly if I was offered a job at Tesla now, I will be pushing to have the bulk of my wages paid in stocks. However, given the uncertainty, the bulk of the coys upside potential is inherent in the uncertainty.
548 2018-08-07 19:39:42 I've been shorting stocks for almost 20 years now, and I have never seen a CEO do something like this
549 2018-08-07 19:39:17 Shortly  after my last tweet the SEC dediced to halt the trading of TESLA stock for investigation. Well done to protect the integrity of capital markets. #stocks #equity #trading #wallstreet
550 2018-08-07 19:39:15 Ooh where did you get this? The only place I have found that stocks a large variety of @methodhome products is @Homebase_uk
551 2018-08-07 19:38:27 420 was an interesting choice for a larp

I don't think you can make announcements like that about stocks

I think it might be illegal

556 2018-08-07 19:33:42 Holy crap look at those stocks.
557 2018-08-07 19:33:28 @ByronBernstein I'm looking to learn more about stocks. What are some recommendations for someone who wants to start buying and what is a good amount of money to start investing with? What is a good starting app to do it?
558 2018-08-07 19:33:27 So let me get this straight. Tina smith owns millions of dollars on medical device stocks- and yet she wants to hear your stories of being ripped off by medical device companies!?? Tina- good bye and hello Dr Painter!
559 2018-08-07 19:33:24 Uhh, is this a plot to get ppl to buy more stocks quickly
560 2018-08-07 19:33:10 Who knew stocks were so cool and sexy? 
561 2018-08-07 19:33:02 What's the deal? looks thin! Any breaking material event?
562 2018-08-07 19:32:40 Like you can trade stocks all day but you can't understand how to properly parse English.
563 2018-08-07 19:31:37 Im selling even if penny stocks smh
564 2018-08-07 19:29:34 Love doing a bit of casual online shopping and finding that one of your favourite stores thinks you're pregnant, on NewLook I look for a bra in my size and it only offers me Maternity, are the stocks low online or something? I go one size up and it offers me the Curves section!
565 2018-08-07 19:28:59 I don’t wanna talk jewelry and cars. Let’s talk property and stocks
566 2018-08-07 19:28:47 I do that too lol . Weekly / monthly charts is something I learnt to do every Friday /Sat and month end on over 200 stocks and ETFs. ( I should do more) . Best way to trade vs the daily noise . Massively important IMO.
567 2018-08-07 19:26:37 Twitter stocks were $16 last year & peaked at $45.07 on June 18 this year. My dumbass should have been invested...

569 2018-08-07 19:25:38 Can y'all just watch to see who buys back the stocks. Sounds like an old trick. yell fire and then pick up the valuables left in the room
570 2018-08-07 19:25:34 Just dogged some of CT for turning to stocks - now to share the only stock i’m in: $MTBC earnings coming up tomorrow & solid bullish divergence on the chart. Super low cap, could fly. Set stop loss bc sometimes dumps on earnings
571 2018-08-07 19:24:46 The truth is I only buy very very (and I mean very) depressed stocks. So I might not be able to understand how TSLA is valued
572 2018-08-07 19:24:15 Obama did a great job creating those jobs didn't he? And once the end of your 4years role in and the economy calapses, the stocks tank, the housing market crashes, 1/3 of all farmers commit suicide and poverty sores, you will blame everyone but the one guy who caused it all. YOU!
573 2018-08-07 19:24:08 Class was over for the businessman and he sat in the lounge, sipping tea as he set up a video call with his board of directors.

583 2018-08-07 19:20:04 @jimcramer I’m feeling inspired by @kevinolearytv to buy dividend paying stocks. What’s your take on $BX?
584 2018-08-07 19:20:01 True, if fans didn't freak out the agencies wouldn't lose so much value on their stocks.  Dating bans protect the artists as much as their brand. It's like some fans seem to think they're in a relationship with them or something 
585 2018-08-07 19:18:33 Sounds good to me. Wall Street stocks have always struck me as another form of gambling… with insiders and analysts spreading smears simply to hedge their own bets.
586 2018-08-07 19:18:21 Hi Millie. Facebook is a privately owned (not government run because we are a capitalist nation) publicly traded company. Meaning you can buy their stocks. 
587 2018-08-07 19:18:08 I had asked in a tweet a while back for you to go priv. It's insane how public companies have so much pressure from vultures. I'm holding my @tesla stocks long and firm.

594 2018-08-07 19:15:23 If we could graph our life like stocks we would have ups and downs. Each one of us. That is normal. When you cannot deal with ups and downs or if an up still feels like a down that is when you get help. Ask.

Freedom of speech only protects from government offices (state or federal).

Privately vs publicly TRADED stocks have nothing to do with constitutionally protected rights.
597 2018-08-07 19:14:42 So, news that $TSLA might go private. Stocks jump as @elonmusk says price per share would be $420.

Wonder where that exact number came from? 
And what else could that number stand for 
Good one Mr. Musk

602 2018-08-07 19:13:46 No, you see, "public" in that context means that the company's stocks are traded publicly as opposed to the company and all its assets being privately held. Just fyi, you wouldn't know me. I went to a public school.

604 2018-08-07 19:12:40 This is how I filtered on daily charts but could not find this exact pattern.

50 DEMA above 200 DEMA

% day change between 0.1 to 0.9 because the last two candles closed nearly at the same price.

Without these filters, too many stocks come up! I got about 200 results yesterday.

628 2018-08-07 19:07:03 @facebook has to answer to its board and those who bought stocks who are private citizens.  Also, this ad hominem attack (libtard) is not only a logical fallacy but also ableist. Try gaining information and education from credible sources and not @FoxNews and @RealAlexJones.

637 2018-08-07 19:03:18 The market needs to crash already man. I’m tryna buy stocks and houses.
638 2018-08-07 19:03:14 Familiar in that I've heard of them and follow them, but not one I've actually tried yet! Think @GnGWells stocks them so will have to try some.
639 2018-08-07 19:02:32 FOCUS on your portfolio of 20 stocks.There might be 100 other companies doing exceptionally well, but u hv to pick your 20 splendid themes.Thats it.
The day u find an idea, buy it then.For long term(3 plus yrs), current high valuation is immaterial.BUT,sab bhav ke khiladi hain 
640 2018-08-07 19:00:44 hope their stocks continue to tank
641 2018-08-07 19:00:36 Heutiger Kursanstieg bei @Tesla hat Elon Musk um 800 Mio $ reicher gemacht .... #stocks, #WallStreet
642 2018-08-07 18:59:34 Roy isn't great, but the top characters actually don't have to work as hard in neutral nor do they need as many neutral wins. Sheik is my ideal character even though she's top tier. Her amazing combo game and neuteal is hindered by a struggle to seal stocks.
643 2018-08-07 18:59:31 $TSLA if not confirmed, Musk in trouble and so are the longs. P.S. no position #stocks

646 2018-08-07 18:57:56 I have 2 stocks but I have no idea what this means. Could you explain?
647 2018-08-07 18:56:59 @elonmusk  privatizing Tesla and buying stocks at $420 a share is the most Tesla thing ever since the flame throwers!
648 2018-08-07 18:56:46 How you buy stocks?

654 2018-08-07 18:55:05 Stock market is the only market in the world where buying (stocks) in retail is cheaper then buying in wholesale $TSLA
655 2018-08-07 18:54:57 Cheers mate. I'm sure someone over here stocks them, I'll keep digging.
656 2018-08-07 18:54:20 Theocracy strapped onto Communism! WHILE STOCKS LAST!
657 2018-08-07 18:54:18 $HMNY  REMEMBER: Adding small limit-buys under the Ask price, will help to support the stock price & protect your current investment. If the price drops, just cancel & add a new lower limit buy. Adding a limit-buy between the Bid & Ask can potentially help price movement. 
658 2018-08-07 18:53:44 Yes, this is ridiculous: $crooge McDuck owns a 100-cubic-feet bin filled with coins, plus priceless artefacts... and that’s just his life’s trophies. He also owns stocks and thriving companies all around the world. He’s thousands of times richer than any of those other guys.

666 2018-08-07 18:50:11 $TSLA Halted T1 pending news!
667 2018-08-07 18:49:40 3/ he made a comment that "We've got a lot of common stocks there, investment portfolio. These are the ones that you'd come out in terms of non-insurance associates. But  we've got a whole bunch of other things. I wish I'd knew when they'd go up.
668 2018-08-07 18:48:45 I just don’t see how you can allegedly steal millions of dollars from your own clients and business partners, short stocks with insider knowledge, and only be sued or fined by the SEC. How is Wilbur Ross’s behavior not considered criminal? Why has he never been prosecuted?
669 2018-08-07 18:47:57 Au contraire, pendant qu'ils achètent des putes brésiliennes ils refont pas les stocks de 7.62
670 2018-08-07 18:46:13 Dear genius who works for a conspiracy website, it's still privately owned. It's publicly *traded*, in that it issues stocks to be traded, but it's not any more publicly owned than Apple is.
671 2018-08-07 18:45:25 The stocks are too harsh, but it's cool concept 
672 2018-08-07 18:45:04 $HMNY BASHING BEARS LOVE TO THINK OF DIFFERENT WAYS THEY CAN SAY THINGS & ASK QUESTIONS THAT INCLUDE THE WORD ”DILUTION,” JUST SO THEY CAN TRY TO SCARE INVESTORS AWAY. (They know they’re causing the problem, but would rather find another way to get #investors mad at Mitch & Ted.)
673 2018-08-07 18:44:52 In the 5th grade we traded (on paper) stocks and bonds, learned how the market worked. Did her school skip that unit? How’d she get into middle school? 
674 2018-08-07 18:43:48 Macro-drivers of gold have been bearish for a long time, but early this year gold was strong anyway, though miners were weak. Then gold weakened and mining stocks looked resilient. It seemed mildly encouraging, but now everything is in gear to the downside in line w. fundamentals
675 2018-08-07 18:43:30 I thought there are family owned companies that are not publicly traded. They are privately held. Not all private corporations trade stocks on the stock market or even report their doings to the SEC.
676 2018-08-07 18:43:07 Better consider fast.. if you look at the stocks. Anyways, good luck.
677 2018-08-07 18:42:51 Liquor related stocks. Anybody can bet on.
678 2018-08-07 18:42:08 And caught not for the first time. He was shorting stocks as well. Ethical behavior is nonexistent in this administration.
679 2018-08-07 18:40:58 watching TSLA from the sidelines is more entertaining than watching my own stocks.
680 2018-08-07 18:40:57 yo, I'm pretty ignorant about stocks... so he may be charged with fraud if he was joking? Is there a term for this type of fraud so I can read up on it? Also, is there a possibility he completely gets away with this sudden announcement?
681 2018-08-07 18:40:49 $TSLA is one of the most heavily shorted stocks, Shorts could be TOTALLY Screwed here imo
682 2018-08-07 18:40:14 Rather like saying investors will suffer billions of losses if stock markets crash.
683 2018-08-07 18:40:08 The all-important crop report will be issued Friday at 11 am central. #World wheat and #corn ending stocks will be the focus along with U.S. demand increases in wheat and corn and a lower export demand on soybeans.
684 2018-08-07 18:40:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
685 2018-08-07 18:39:42 They did stand up to Amazon and several other business and were told to shut up and sit down. New plan is to hand out tickets to Motorbikes and Cars with loud exhausts and Pearl Jam. These people are a joke and the laughing stocks of DC. #AmateurHour
686 2018-08-07 18:39:03 @elonmusk *considers* going private and in 20 minutes the stocks rockets up 8% just shows how much influence this genius has. Amazing
687 2018-08-07 18:38:38 Yep. As a guy who trades stocks I wish my shares had the power to do what i wanted. Alas, owning stock doesn't mean the company is run like a collective utopia.
688 2018-08-07 18:37:10 @HalftimeReport Really, your (Josh) snide political remarks have no place or no value on a stock show, just makes you look stupid, not sure about you but I live in America, what have you done to support America, NOTHING, you buy/sale stocks, get over your self
689 2018-08-07 18:36:36 @elonmusk Need your help..... want to buy some Shares when you go Private ! Please help us do this with you.. we have never bought Stocks or anything like them... but we have watched you grow and would like to go for a ride with you on this Private stock...... tell us how to buy.
690 2018-08-07 18:35:39 my local library should allow me to buy stocks, dammit

what has america come to with these commies telling me i can't buy stocks in a public library
691 2018-08-07 18:35:27 Something like 50% of stocks of BSE 500 are down 50%+ year to date. A great dichotomy
692 2018-08-07 18:35:25 Tesla stocks halted after Musk’s tweet. Whoa! I feel the pains of people who shorted. Ouch, ouch, ouch.
693 2018-08-07 18:35:02 I think my priorities are messed up.   I can watch various stocks that I own dip and put me deep red and I'm as calm as can be, but a fucking fly that has been buzzing around my head all damed day has me about ready to go HULK SMASH!
694 2018-08-07 18:34:46 @Deishma nimblr sr if possible ..provide possibe stocks to short and go long list
695 2018-08-07 18:34:21 $MFI CN (maple leaf, btw how do you do tickers for ex US stocks on here?). Promotional mgmt team suggest pork margin compression temporary, it’s not. Overhang from potential action on Canada Bread price fixing scheme (owned it during alleged period)
696 2018-08-07 18:34:20 I don't know stock markets well. I do have a general understanding of how stocks work though. But.....until today.....I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT STOCK MARKET NEWS! #Tesla Burn those shorts bb!
697 2018-08-07 18:34:00 Only illegal if a merger would have already fixed and THEN he would openly say the price before the price change, He's only giving a possible number in CASE in WOULD reach it. No trouble there. Done every single day. (but more on the very small stocks, just saying)

702 2018-08-07 18:32:58 In the house we don’t say “I’m going for a jerk” it’s “I’m going to check the stocks”

708 2018-08-07 18:29:45 I will tell you this from working at a hedge fund that was short stocks. Every hedge fund who is short $TSLA #Tesla will be calling every government official, SEC member and lawyer to see if #ElonMusk violated any laws with his tweet.
709 2018-08-07 18:29:44 This "woman" is such an idiot and those who follow her are worse. Yep, I'm a supporter and I'm paid; by my stocks going up and being worth more with the better economy.

711 2018-08-07 18:29:05 Goodnight from India. Don't deal in stocks, else would have loved to invest in Tesla.
712 2018-08-07 18:28:39 I live in Ga. I see no problem with it. Maybe if we brought back the stocks in the town square we could reduce the crime rate.
713 2018-08-07 18:27:58 Duh! Wasn't it the intention of #Antifa to publicly shame the inocent victims? These thugs deserve to be identified, I think that this is justification for bringing back the market square stocks.

718 2018-08-07 18:26:04 If it hasn’t become apparent by everyone yet. Bob Quinn isn’t going to be a big roller. He signs value players and stocks through the draft.

721 2018-08-07 18:25:19 Increased fuel prices, health care, inflation, cuts to Medicare & social security have far eaten the tiny pittance of a temporary tax cut offered to the people. Corporations get richer off their permanent t tax cuts, and trickle down is a lie. They are buying back their stocks.
722 2018-08-07 18:25:08 What do we expect with the TSLA shares halted?  Usually just happens on junk penny stocks.

728 2018-08-07 18:23:36 Decided to see how much Jeff Bezos (the owner of Amazon) makes in a day, today alone he made 1.4 billion dollars off of his stocks in Amazon alone. Put that into perspective Drake's net worth is 100 mil, now Jeff made 14 times drakes entire net worth in a day.
729 2018-08-07 18:23:03 Everyone is watch for the $TSLA news and not trading other stocks, j/k LOL
730 2018-08-07 18:22:46 INVENTARIOS: Cuanta más alta sea la rotación significa que hay una buena administración y gestión de los inventarios, pues cuanto menor sea el tiempo de estancia de las mercaderías en almacén, menor será el capital de trabajo invertido en los inventarios. #stocks
731 2018-08-07 18:22:30 It’s like third party investing. They allow you to buy some stocks or mutual funds and invest that way. A lot of companies do this if they don’t have their own stocks to sell employees. 401k. (I think.) someone correct me if I’m wrong.
732 2018-08-07 18:21:53 Do you approve Elon Musk's decision to make #Tesla a private company? #forex #forexsignals #ForexTrader #trading #ElonMusk #elonmuskdidnothingwrong #stockstowatch #stocks
733 2018-08-07 18:21:42 Waiting for Musk to tweet he's taking a 50% stake in $APRN, $GPRO, and $SNAP ... why not use his superpowers to lift all stocks? #moneyneversleeps
734 2018-08-07 18:20:35 Crypto isn't stocks so this cannot be compared. It's a cryptocurrency not a cryptocommodity.

737 2018-08-07 18:19:12 I also will not give up my tesla stocks..
738 2018-08-07 18:18:46 This is exactly why I did not buy the dip on $IFMK
Stocks running with no news are more likely to fade than the ones with news.
739 2018-08-07 18:18:10 It’s stocks are publicly traded.
740 2018-08-07 18:17:23 Oddly enough, your picks are all up:

SHOO (Sneakers) +.35 (.63%)
and FANG (FAANG stocks) +1.59 (1.19%)   what else is in your shopping bag LOL?
741 2018-08-07 18:17:20 You want to make money trading stocks/commodities etc?
Then concentrate on the end result, and it is the price.
Everything is factored in it.

748 2018-08-07 18:16:13 less than 20x is just an anchor sometimes even 25-30 ok coz of rock solid pricing power like fmcg. i did miss many stocks. but i never lost a lot of money too. so it works for me
749 2018-08-07 18:16:13 The £ was artificially high and would have dropped against the dollar post vote either way. The city also backed the Remain vote to win and that’s why the stocks fell in the first few hours. Basically post vote the city lost its ass on bets and thus everything fell.
750 2018-08-07 18:16:02 Hmm maybe it was all an elaborate ruse to make these companies utilities as some of the companies stocks were starting to tank, and both sides of the political spectrum seem to support the idea now.
751 2018-08-07 18:15:59 Lol. I was talking about trading stocks, but now u have me thinking 
752 2018-08-07 18:15:29 cannabis stocks hammered again today. terrible
753 2018-08-07 18:14:42 How much of an impact on overall market prices has the reduction in the number of public stocks over the past couple decades. Say 8,600 down to now 3,600, as pension and 401k $ has grown substantially at the same time.
754 2018-08-07 18:14:37 $TROV holding up well last couple days
755 2018-08-07 18:13:59 yes. for some reason this memory came flashing back to me, just remembering all the pit traders who always hated feeders and always shorting stocks.
756 2018-08-07 18:13:36 The constant description of what moved stock markets in general is a major under-discussed media failure. Anyone who took econ 101 knows that no one knows what makes stocks move. They are all guesses.
757 2018-08-07 18:13:32 Good stuff man! How do you filter your stocks?
758 2018-08-07 18:13:07 what is your definition of value? Less than 20 P/E? ...but all consistent performers are expensive stocks with high PE and p/BV now...isnt it confusing?

775 2018-08-07 18:06:55 Thanks! Try to find a way that it's "just" Tesla. Fidelity funds with spaceX are nice, but those funds hold a ton of other less important stocks. A large portion of my NW went to Tesla based on mission and results, not to a fund with 6.9% Tesla. I don't want to diversify it down

835 2018-08-07 17:48:43 What are the SEC rules here?  News comes out all the time about companies and the stocks move.  For sure this Tweet wasn't hidden - it was full public disclosure and we all found out about the same time.  Should he write a letter?

841 2018-08-07 17:47:49 Higher highs in weak volume is a bad sign.  So is the fact that most stocks are not anywhere near their yearly highs.  It does not look like a particularly healthy market though sentiment could carry it much higher esp. If some investors on the sidelines capitulate and go back in
842 2018-08-07 17:47:36 @jimcramer aren’t stocks supposed to be on forward earnings? Seems the pop is only because of a tweet... has nothing to do with earnings. Whoever were to buy at $420 wouldn’t it be a terrible deal
843 2018-08-07 17:47:36 I'd like a slice of that pie too.   My first stocks I ever purchased! I see $1000 in a couple years. Honest question since I'm new to this.  Once they are up and running, continuously profitable, and done expanding so quickly, do you think they will pay dividends?
844 2018-08-07 17:47:21 How does this not violate any requirements for disclosing material information?  Wouldn't many other stocks be halted prior to an announcement of this magnitude?  "Considering" is a key term here I suppose.

847 2018-08-07 17:45:32 You are very confused. Publicly owned meaning they sell stocks, not public sector as in govt owned. Maybe do your research before issuing gotchas and really making yourself look like a fool.

853 2018-08-07 17:44:28 For naive use cases integers are OK, though when you get into interest computation, stocks, foreign exchange, etc. you need variable precision again. Naive programmers are regardless going to write what they’re used to
854 2018-08-07 17:43:56 Uh, you clearly do not know what "Public" means in the context of describing a business. Basically, a public company is one in which you can purchase equity (stocks) on the open market. A private company is one in which you can not.
855 2018-08-07 17:43:53 SEC you have halted penny stocks for much less, need the halt and investigation and if false, prosecution and long time halt

908 2018-08-07 17:23:26 In lieu of that, a guy who works with stocks trying explain this stuff to OP in the comments is pretty enlightening/hilarious 
909 2018-08-07 17:22:11 Isn't 30% in cash high? Arent you being emotionally attached to your stocks
910 2018-08-07 17:22:06 Stocks open higher ... Dow +100 points.
911 2018-08-07 17:21:07 It's like saying the 1980's was a fantastic run for stocks and then forgetting to mention October 1987. Those HR hitters didn't play in a vacuum. Hitters, by far, and on average, are much more accomplished, smarter and better today than they were in the 50s and 60s. That's fact.

914 2018-08-07 17:19:24 roce means business has some inherent advantages. roe could be inflated by leverage, defeats purpose of finding good stocks coz even junks like Lux or dollar industries have good roe but pathetic roce

916 2018-08-07 17:18:44 This is a new level though.... this isn’t facts in a story. This is literally just how stocks work and definitions of words. This is just being a moron.

919 2018-08-07 17:15:07 Assuming a good person who is has always worked hard for Minnesota and supported issues in the best interests of the State is all of a sudden going to vote in her own interests is ridiculous. 
The stocks she owns are declared and she is well within her right to have them.

940 2018-08-07 17:09:29 Whole Foods usually has them but they sell out sometimes. But that’s the only store I know of that stocks them
941 2018-08-07 17:09:20 Please DO NOT BUY MUTUAL FUNDS OR STOCKS. Robert Kiyosaki Warns about those investments. You buy, and hope I goes up in value. That’s not investing, that’s gambling. Buy assets that pay your bills every month whether you work or not

948 2018-08-07 17:08:18 I'm on vacation at my aunt's place and it's essentially just hanging out taking about the stock market despite the fact that I don't have the money to buy stocks
949 2018-08-07 17:08:12 if this happens, the shorties are blown up completely. Something similar happened with Volkswagen and Porsche. Not enough stocks on the free market to buy back the stocks by the shorts :-)
950 2018-08-07 17:07:38 True that. What’s high though? Any benchmark you set? Planning to consolidate existing holdings for a focused portfolio of 3-5 stocks. So trying to figure out few filters :) in case you may advice ofc.

964 2018-08-07 17:04:07 Ehhh idk bout this. I think theres just a lot of variance in characters/playstyles. Some characters/players wipe out two stocks fast and some dont. This wont change in any fighting game. Might as well just lower the timer from six mins instead of stocks
965 2018-08-07 17:03:28 Hey @FredericLambert what does this mean? Will people not able to buy stocks as they now? And how will it benefit tesla? Will its value be $70 billion as will be at $420 ? Can u please explain
966 2018-08-07 17:03:24 Seems like short market makers got a memo today to stack(ask wall) their inventory to attempt influencing prices down...Seeing it all over the OTC today...working on most stocks... $LDSI and $BYOC ain't falling for that shit though. 
967 2018-08-07 17:03:22 I read that as "a tesla private" and was like "hes hiring an escort party wut"  taking it private. Stocks. Right lol

970 2018-08-07 17:01:41 Dee, have you ever -- not including a company managed 401K -- purchased stock in a company?

If you had, you'd know how hilariously wrong you are. Like, this is stocks 101.
971 2018-08-07 17:00:45 The main thing I think 3 stock helps fix is the skill gap. It’s harder to lose to someone weaker than you in 3 stocks even in bad mu’s. But if you play a bad mu in 2 stocks, it is easier for them to cause an upset.
972 2018-08-07 17:00:45 One of the heaviest shorted stocks? Surprised they aren’t there now
973 2018-08-07 17:00:45 Hi @ValueAnalyst1 sorry for my ignorance. Would this mean our stocks will ,e "only worth" $420 if they go private at that number? If so I am kinda disappointed!
974 2018-08-07 17:00:33 I heard about it about 1.5 yrs ago and bought it because they said TWLO was the engine behind Whatsapp, FB, and other soc med. I was disappointed seeing it went nowhere for a year when soc med stocks were sky rocketing.  Until today

985 2018-08-07 16:53:08 doesn't the % of household wealth-in-stocks indicator move pretty closely with the value of stocks? which seems logical, coincident, and not enormously interesting. I am sure the value of stocks is a much bigger volatility in that chart than any allocation decision by households.

992 2018-08-07 16:51:15 When it hits $420 or buy the stocks soon for $420? Surprised you’re allowed to say something like this because it will directly effect the stock price in the immediate and long term.

1004 2018-08-07 16:45:47 I think you did fine between the two tweets. Sm4sh is super defensive but every (viable) character has jank that can take stocks in the blink of eye, which makes the player who got janked feel like their defense was pointless, and that the game is basically over.
1005 2018-08-07 16:44:45 The man said jobs numbers were the biggest hoax in history, then immediately touted them after his election. Said stocks were big fat ugly bubble. Now he encourages us to invest in the bubble. Amazing that so-called capitalists listen to and believe in this Godless cad.
1006 2018-08-07 16:43:09 I don't think there is much science to it anyway, human emotions can be very irrational. I think you're right, there are always certain stocks that tend to correlate very well to the general sector they represents, wouldn't be surprised if that is one of them.

1040 2018-08-07 16:31:42 @sommiLTswinger It's not what you would  think.. Only bought a few weeks ago. However, Zacks Stocks under 10 portfolio bought in April.
1041 2018-08-07 16:31:22 @ScottWapnerCNBC @ReformedBroker @jlebenthal Your show focuses on traders that often buy stocks because of improving technicals - momentum stocks. Of course new mkt highs will spur more buying.  To deny that now is dumb.
1042 2018-08-07 16:31:20 If a company sell stocks then the company is now partially owned by others. The policies of the company effects the stock prices of their product either negatively or positively affecting stockholders. You would think the stockholders would have rights.
1043 2018-08-07 16:30:19 I feel like stocks need to either melt more consistently like in Melee, or be held more consistently like in Brawl (preferably the former) to stop single exchanges from being so impactful and thus causing high variance

1176 2018-08-07 15:36:44 The way I see it is the Democrats tax to improve things like roads, schools, etc.  The GOP gives tax cuts only to the wealthy where it doesn’t trickle down and they buy back stocks.  We end up paying for it with cuts to Medicare,  Social Security, etc.

1185 2018-08-07 15:30:38 The trend does not change when stocks bounce with intensity from lows. And when the weakness starts again - the holders panic very fast and that's why Buying Panic Lows at best works as a trading plays

1202 2018-08-07 15:21:32 Scenario #1: Bull Market Rips Higher by 20%. The stock portion of your 50/50 portfolio would be 20% higher (or 10% a year). So, your two-year annualized portfolio return would be around 12.6%. That’s 10% from stocks and 2.6% from bonds.
1203 2018-08-07 15:21:03 I suggest that anybody who is fully invested in the stock market consider swapping some of their equities for shorter-term Treasuries in case stocks head to the dumper.

1235 2018-08-07 15:09:44 It's the same reason why Juno sold for $200,000,000 in one year just by offering a lower commission and stock options. Stocks end up being a lie but the idea that it's all about participation. These companies are impotent without us. Let's create our own.

1422 2018-08-07 13:53:10 @Homebase_uk Your website says that you have 8 of product SKU: 787243 in stock at your Saffron Walden store. I went to the shop and was told that they don't - and that what the website says and what they have aren't the same thing (their words). 12 mile trip wasted.
1423 2018-08-07 13:52:42 Looks like today once again could be the highest #volume day of all time for $HMNY - LET THAT SINK IN FOR A FEW.. 
1424 2018-08-07 13:52:37 Picking charts for analysis is my weak link.

1428 2018-08-07 13:52:17 I’ve become obsessed with watching stocks lol I already have 2 and might just go purchase a few more
1429 2018-08-07 13:52:06 U.S. stocks opened higher on Tuesday,with the S&P 500 within striking distance of a record high,lifted largely by gains in technology stocks.
1430 2018-08-07 13:52:00 I use stops quite a lot but I trade upwards of 30-40 stocks at a time sometimes. $AGY is a recent example. Bought on low level of then current support. Was stopped out half a point under volume and picked up 2c lower.
Picked up an extra 3k in profit before the run.
1431 2018-08-07 13:51:55 Stocks start higher again despite a very stupid American President negotiating with a very stubborn Chinese dictator. Who knows where these trade wars go. I know we will all pay for it with higher prices.

1440 2018-08-07 13:48:32 We are in the midst of another strong earnings season with FactSet tracking earnings growth of 24%, as of 8/3. Trade worries are still an overhang for the market but the strong earnings have given stocks a boost, currently the S&P 500 is about 1% away from the highs in January.
1441 2018-08-07 13:47:20 on the value side, the stocks that seem like opportunities to me right now are $FCAU at $16.90 and $FFXDF at $15.90.  You have to wait for yrs and let game play out to benefit.

So which on stocks will fall first ? 

Seems like a bubble
1542 2018-08-07 12:53:23 Sir, how have other stocks from your advisory this year fared? Are they stable or bleeding?
1543 2018-08-07 12:53:08 open your eyes to the conspiracies of the trump organization and how rich they have become since taking office, manipulating stocks and positioning trump hotels and future hotels in countries all over the world for favors
1544 2018-08-07 12:53:04 Info can be used to trade the stocks rather than the options obviously
1545 2018-08-07 12:53:02 World shares move towards a 6-month high Tuesday,as the biggest jump in Chinese stocks in over 2 years & an upbeat start for Europe followed a U.S. best market closing since January.
1546 2018-08-07 12:52:35 @OptionsHawk do you have any stock subscriptions that don’t include options? I just have been getting burned and would rather just buy/sell stocks

1548 2018-08-07 12:51:49 Hi Simon, thanks for your tweet. The offer was on @walkers_crisps Max, however the promotion is subject to whilst stocks last. Therefore, there won't be any more crisps being sent to the @thechapelhouse2.

1551 2018-08-07 12:49:12 Cramer gets political when they affect his stocks, a few weeks back he was texting about trump every 30mins
1552 2018-08-07 12:49:04 I'm tired of trump talking about the economy and stocks!  Economy is only doing good if you are the 1% that makes millions and billions and we gave you our money through the Republican tax cut the poor people are giving rich people more money all we got was tariffs and inflation
1553 2018-08-07 12:48:58 Are you suggesting that *every* elected official who holds stocks lacks the integrity to vote in the interest of Americans and, conversely, would only vote to enhance their portfolios? Therefore, no one who has stocks can run for & hold office b/c of a lack of moral fortitude?
1554 2018-08-07 12:48:12 Lotsa chatter that $VIX is around 11, moving in on yearly lows, which is kind of a false positive. VIX declines basically declines as stocks rise. In S&P 500 Index options, which are used to hedge stocks, $CBOE saw big uptick in past month. context over content often matters.

1564 2018-08-07 12:43:39 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1565 2018-08-07 12:43:28 If you have cash in your IRA etc and just can't talk yourself into investing it at these levels, I would recommend having a watchlist, compiling stocks you like. That way when the next recession comes, (and we're overdue) you don't have to scramble then.
1566 2018-08-07 12:42:59 Key list is in alphabetical order. This way you can find the tickers faster when placing an order. SLOWLY scan and note pre-market action. Adjust alerts.  #stocks
1567 2018-08-07 12:42:09 When the general market valuation are high, be extra diversified even if the stocks you are buying are cheap. When the general market is cheap be concentrated.
1568 2018-08-07 12:41:45 Anyone investing in stocks this morning?
1569 2018-08-07 12:41:32 I am not putting my confidence anywhere. Stocks have not broken any long term up trend. And gold has not broken any multi-year down trend yet. That's what I am going with until that situation changes.
1570 2018-08-07 12:41:18 My prof in investment and portfolio discussed about beta, intrinsic value, efficient market and how to analyze value of stocks and companies,  nawala ako sa sarili ko at naisip na

1585 2018-08-07 12:35:09 The way CHF and JPY are performing today vs USD I would not be taking on risk, but yet stocks are shooting up.

1586 2018-08-07 12:34:26 What happened..chasing hot stocks?
1587 2018-08-07 12:34:20 Sorry Mr. Painter but she is not alone with her finger in the pie. Insider trading is a rite of passage in Washington and many on both sides line their pickets with manipulated stocks. And they do it openly.
1588 2018-08-07 12:34:06 I understand that you like gold and your Twitter handle doesn't hide that. But I really think that gold will stay a relatively poor performer as long as stocks stay in their current bull market. When that trend changes I will go along with the change.
1589 2018-08-07 12:33:10 @option_snipper tk for what you do. I noticed this week you are being more instructional in your tweets, as opposed to providing specific strikes on specific stocks. Those of us that work full time utilize those specific strike calls as it is hard to study the charts full time.

1603 2018-08-07 12:22:00 I mean, I understand that an insurance co has to think about interest rates... But I am afraid the longer you think about macro stuff, the less you think about single businesses and therefore your stocks selection tend to suffer.

Thanks
1615 2018-08-07 12:14:07 Have started to weed out poor stocks with weak fundamentals from today onwards. Will invest in kikesnof L&T, Hero Moto, Maruti, HDFC Bank to name a few. Would be with 10 to 12 but strong ones. Would look to scalp a few in mid n small caps with sheer trading perspective.

Best back to back quarters since 2003. Next up; analysts will be forced to raise Q3/Q4 and '19 estimates. Stocks are cheap.

1669 2018-08-07 11:19:27 So youre arguing my point ? In any of these instances, if the final bout consists of free stocks given or possible collusion between two friends the reaction would be the same. I get your point its a game,  but that can be said about anything. Its as important as any other comp

1680 2018-08-07 11:10:42 That’s fair, but people who think like you and I do wouldn’t require a 25% discount to NAV to provide some support.

2048 2018-08-07 05:34:11 I am aware of these concepts and use CCI mostly. I am aware of RSI too and divergences etc. My goal is to come up with a process/system which will churn out stocks like Bata, if not a bata, ones like maruti from yesterday, at least get close even if I cannot fully achieve.
2049 2018-08-07 05:33:43 I need to get a handle on Juri's spacing and pressure game, the former before the latter because since I keep spacing shit wrong, I can't apply pressure anyway.

Charging stocks is a risk even on knockdown because it gets blown up by neutral quickrise.
2050 2018-08-07 05:32:54 Lol but I am not gonna make it so hoping that there will still be stocks on the 16th but who you joking jem hahahaha
2051 2018-08-07 05:32:49 If the open is below the previous day's low , only then it's a gap down opening . Stocks always open away from the previous day's close , whether up or down. Those are not gaps

2065 2018-08-07 05:25:02 My idea is to start managing risk from the very first step, which is the screener list. Next chart analysis of screened stocks to manage more risk, so on and so forth.
2066 2018-08-07 05:23:32 I understand but I am on a look out for good screener which will pop out for me a list of stocks like Bata. Using mere rsi and cci won't lead to a list of stocks like bata. I have experimented with cci and there's risk of momentum fizzling out for no good rhyme or reason.

2208 2018-08-07 03:24:39 Stronger macro (rising growth, inflation) leads to higher yields and often rising stock prices. Another way of saying bonds and stocks are negatively correlated. Not very controversial. Having said that, I don't think this correlation is "tradably strong."

2312 2018-08-07 02:09:13 @knuckleheadedninja @GoodNewsBull that's crazy, I trade inversions when the markets go down, then I go back to regular stocks whn spy good.
2313 2018-08-07 02:07:41 1. there are plenty of ETFs relative to history, it’s only very small ones that are missing (i.e. Boiler Room underwritings)

2. liquidity issues with ETFs are the same as liquidity issues for every other security under the sun. 

3. reg people suck at picking growth stocks.
2314 2018-08-07 02:07:20 Looks like someone doesnt realize the markets work in real time with self projections for the future based on cureent events. Looks like alot of people are confident in the US economy under Trump. Dont buy stocks you'd lose all ur money since u have no clue what u r talking about
2315 2018-08-07 02:06:12 Lots of tech stocks are taking a beating this month. That means there is some great deals.
2316 2018-08-07 02:05:39 Magalaw talaga ang stocks...  huhu ito gusto ko matutunan ehh
2317 2018-08-07 02:05:16 The # of US stocks has been cut in half since 1997 but ex-US has doubled from 20k stocks to 40k in that time
2318 2018-08-07 02:04:06 Trumps best GDP quarter would have been Obama’s 5th best.

Trumps first 18 months of jobs was worse than Obama’s last 18 months.

Trump is adding debt as fast as the recession — except it’s a good economy. What happens when the economy crashes?

Stocks are down since new tax law.

2320 2018-08-07 02:03:37 Come on josh.  Instead they put their money in ETFs without understanding the liqudity issues.  Stocks are certainly not for everyone but that isn't a good enough reason for not having more IPOs from growth companies
2321 2018-08-07 02:03:00 Absolutely . I run across so many everyday that have been curious but it seems out of reach . Up there with trading forex or stocks. They have no idea its as easy as downloading an app......... and just researching. I always have them download #Coinomi or #jaxx and send a few .

2323 2018-08-07 02:02:44 What’s the Difference in Price Movement—between Currency Futures, Commodity Futures, Stock Index Futures, and Common Stocks?
1) There is No Difference.
2 ) Prices move-From—The Largest New or Unfilled Buy orders-To-The Largest New or Unfilled Sell orders—in All Markets.

2329 2018-08-07 01:59:15 what movie is that? And yeah my mom worked at century 21, she never really got back to working jobs she used to tho. Now she stocks at Target.
2330 2018-08-07 01:58:49 When I stop finding stocks in multiple Sectors breaking to new highs, I'll stop being bullish on the market as a whole. It's really that simple for me for right now. $SPY $QQQ $DIA $IWM
2331 2018-08-07 01:58:38 Big news doesn't get punished bc it's huge money, millions. Stock markets, brands, commercials, board members,..etc.. Rich powerful ppl are behind big fake news. The only way to stop them, boycott their brands. Tank their stocks.
2332 2018-08-07 01:58:36 Yea, looks like 14 stocks out of $XLY and 5 out of $XLK. I own them based on relative strength analysis, $XLC will become another I track for portfolio inclusion. If $XLY & $XLK weaken relatively, they’ll get kicked out.

2341 2018-08-07 01:50:25 Get a finacial advisor. They will help you invest it in stocks and bonds.
2342 2018-08-07 01:49:57 The concept of 'penny stocks' is also a US thing. Lot of billion pound companies in the UK have share prices in pennies. (indeed all prices are quoted in pennies)
2343 2018-08-07 01:49:45 Yes, but you are educating newbies on what to look for. There is no value whatsoever following that type of Twitter account. It's hard enough to focus on 4 or 5 stocks let alone 20-30.
2344 2018-08-07 01:49:44 Just think, his father gave him half a billion to start with in 1974, had he just put the money into stocks and bonds he’d be worth about 20 billion now.  Instead he refuses to show his tax returns and is maybe worth 3B.  Lousy at business.

2355 2018-08-07 01:35:33 This totally explains why Facebooks stocks has dropped recently. I was not the only person who thought Facebook, a social media platform was a public utility. FCC might just change that. The internet is more intrusive than broadcast radio waves in today’s world.

2372 2018-08-07 01:22:32 US stocks rose on Monday, with the NASDAQ rising for a fifth straight day as investors focused on healthy corporate earnings, which have buoyed the market over recent sessions, although trade-related worries lingered.

2390 2018-08-07 00:58:32 for all down-moving stocks, start with 100% level - that's close price right before ER in this case. then you have to decide where to land 38.2 50 61.8 levels. that's never easy job and people do it very differently. i've already explained how i do it long ago.

2404 2018-08-07 00:42:28 The idea is to have your money work for you. You have to save money to invest it, rather spend it.

1. Real Estate.
2. Stocks 
3. Bonds.
4 . Funds.
5. Mortgages.
6. Currency Exchange. 
7. Commodities and precious metals.

2409 2018-08-07 00:34:18 Just invested $25 into MoviePass stocks, I'd honestly recommend anyone to invest a few dollars into it, with how cheap it is right now and how much it keeps fluctuating, either you'll make a bit of money if they pull through, or be out just a few dollars if they go bankrupt.
2410 2018-08-07 00:33:32 Portfolio update: Added more $CSL and $IVV, got rid some other stocks. No change in $REA, $MQG, $KGN, $CPU and $CAR. I did say I'm not gonna buy $IVV unless it dropped, but I did, gotto spend spare cash #ausbiz

2413 2018-08-07 00:31:01 Funny.  Because gold is an asset.  Stocks are an asset.  Stocks are way up.  Because the economy is the strongest in years.  Thanks to Trump.  So I agree with you except for the “reverse” part.  But props on the hate,  it’s been awhile since we’ve had that from Hollywood.

2417 2018-08-07 00:27:32 Your choice, I like facts in stocks as much as real news. Journalism is under attack with 'Enemy of the People'. Now that should really offend you before a stock comment.
2418 2018-08-07 00:27:19 This is kind of ironic given all the hot air you have been creating about this and other small items to avoid the real issues at hand.

2421 2018-08-07 00:26:25 Last time I checked, a company whose stocks are available publicly to be purchased are not a privately owned company anymore, and there are sources out there spreading hate far worse than anything Alex Jones has ever said that haven't been purged yet.

2424 2018-08-07 00:21:10 Is the choice of ADDING to AMD today and preparing to add more as 20bn mkt cap approaches vs. diversifying into other stocks in watchlist A  a liquidity issue (AMD more liquid than others in watchlist) or portfolio management issue (easier to manage fewer stocks at this point)?
2425 2018-08-07 00:20:58 I see someone else mentioned Reminisces of a Stock Operator and I believe to be in top 5. But just recently came across “Thinking in Bets” by Annie Duke. Begins with the theory of resulting. And just zooms from there. Poker horses stocks bonds. Thinking in Bets is the book

2428 2018-08-07 00:16:18 Made some moves with my stocks today, hopefully it works out in my favor 
2429 2018-08-07 00:15:03 Don’t rush the process. You need to be patient and let good habits form. Overtrading is something I’ve always struggled with and it takes a lot to sick on my hands at times. Journaling my trades has been invaluable for my progress.

2430 2018-08-07 00:14:59 Aussie market off to a softer start after lifting by 0.6% on Monday. #ASX 200 -4pts or -0.1% to 6268. Choppy trade. Mining stocks are the main weight. Banks a touch firmer #ausbiz
2431 2018-08-07 00:14:20 President cites weakness in China stocks as sign that we are beginning to "win" the trade war. Watch out for tweets.
2432 2018-08-07 00:13:52 Want to hear something crazy? The recurring annual expense fee on a diversified portfolio of stocks can be #free, too. Wild, I know. Active has been cheap for a while. Those silly fund expenses. Funds aren’t stocks.
2433 2018-08-07 00:13:07 I couldn't understand any of this story! Sorry, was it supposed to be funny? Did stocks really drop?. I hope so! Like Alex or not he has a right to have his show and people have a right to watch it or not! Not investing in any market who bans free speech.
2434 2018-08-07 00:11:08 Perhaps @markee88 would be so kind as to replenish our low stocks????

2436 2018-08-07 00:08:34 Canadian governments are largely responsible for declining wild stocks obviously.
2437 2018-08-07 00:08:25 Or they'll just lose a lot of users, which is why they say their stocks dropped at least one of those recent days. I know I'll be leaving twitter if I find third party apps too frustrating to be useable.
2438 2018-08-07 00:08:24 CANADA LAUGHS > Saudi's kick out Canadian diplomats, suspend trade with us and TSX stocks go UP! So funny! #Saudi economy in huge peril as Age of Oil collapses. Their rulers are lost, in chaos, like #Trump! #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli #stock #StocksToWatch #climate #EnergyEfficiency
2439 2018-08-07 00:08:20 Bet they Fonda and alike have a real problem with the $$$$ they are making on the stock market...sure haven’t heard anything about them selling all those stocks to “get” @realDonaldTrump

2441 2018-08-07 00:06:07 @WarrenBuffett I would like 2 know how a grandmother of close 2 20 grandkids & 6 greats could afford 2 buy stocks with only about $5 a month 4 extras. My family is in such terrible shape & I just want to try 2 get something 2 leave my grandchildren. Any advise would be helpful.
2442 2018-08-07 00:05:55 Can y’all please stop stealing from Walmart. My stocks are going down
2443 2018-08-07 00:05:44 $CHKE pulling a $SMRT move
2444 2018-08-07 00:05:15 Yeah, and I'm still extremely irritated at twitter for that. Apparently I'm far from the other one though based on their stocks dropping like a lead balloon.
2445 2018-08-07 00:05:14 fucking thank you no one knows that Bezos doesn’t have that much in his checking account it’s tied in stocks

2448 2018-08-07 00:02:58 The most valuable things in life are not measured in monetary terms. The really important things are not houses and lands, stocks and bonds, automobiles and real estate, but friendships, trust, confidence, empathy, mercy, love, and faith.

2449 2018-08-07 00:02:57 Haha. I got a little bit of Zec because of you. Haven't branched into traditional stocks yet. Cheers!
2450 2018-08-07 00:02:21 You're numbers are the same as Obama at this point in his term. Economy has been going well since 1/2 way thru Obama's 1st term and the balloon is about to pop due to the corps artificially propping up their stocks. The #BlueWave is coming and it is all thanks to @realDonaldTrump
2451 2018-08-07 00:02:15 I can't wait for the stories showing half the administration has been loading up on steel stocks all of 2017.
2452 2018-08-07 00:00:48 Agree.  Cheap stocks are cheap for a reason.  Why Buffett added the quality / moat compontent to cigar butt investing.
