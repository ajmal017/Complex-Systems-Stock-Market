Cualquier duda por aquí.
2 2019-04-14 23:56:38 For anyone asking why Shulk and Ness both lost 2 stocks instead of one it's because there's an option in the game where if you SD you'd lose 2 stocks (Or points if you play timed) instead of one.
3 2019-04-14 23:56:07 but he also has that sexy stranger things rev, what's his investment options? is he into MFs', bonds, stocks? if you give me a good answer I'll undeclare the fake news
4 2019-04-14 23:54:42 Not sure exactly

Research, record Employment data & Recession and link the same

The economy drives...
The perception of value is in the rear view mirror.

Robots are not improving the economy, stocks, property, commodities need to catch up.

Immutable truth is a static observer
5 2019-04-14 23:54:10 How did you lose 2 stocks
6 2019-04-14 23:54:00 For people asking why Ness lost two stocks, it's because he has the rule of an SD takes two stocks. If you look at Shulk, when he died, he also lost two stocks. Sheik lost one stock. She lost one because she actually "died". Ness and Shulk both had an SD
7 2019-04-14 23:53:54 They want it, but to only benefit the rich and their stocks, so the rich gets richer and GOP pockets get fatter. Profits, party and to hell with Americans before Country and what's right is the GOP way.
8 2019-04-14 23:53:02 pretty sure the option to lose 2 stocks when you SD is on. Shulk also lost 2 stocks
9 2019-04-14 23:52:19 Only reason I want it to be Monday is so I can check my stocks...
10 2019-04-14 23:52:03 Is no one going to mention that when ness died it took 2 stocks?
11 2019-04-14 23:52:01 Ok abut how did the white Ness go from 3 stocks to 1 after one death???
12 2019-04-14 23:51:38 How tf Ness loose two stocks for that?
13 2019-04-14 23:51:29 Left cause your ruleset is set to 2 stocks
14 2019-04-14 23:51:17 Lol shulk and ness both lost 2 stocks.
15 2019-04-14 23:50:06 If he takes the money and puts in property, then he pays a much lower tax rate than if he kept it in the bank. Using property and stocks as a means to lower a tax burden is common for rich tax dodgers. Sanders is a rich tax dodger. AKA a hypocrite.
16 2019-04-14 23:49:28 For us, we are surprised the US Bank stocks, still reporting  better than good earnings. Suggesting the market still clouded by worry, not threat.
17 2019-04-14 23:48:36 During was sweat on toilet stocks .   
18 2019-04-14 23:46:54 It's a temporary setback, perpetually amongst 2 of the most shorted stocks in America. It's constantly under attack, but it will bounce back. 

You can bet your short profit on it, dude...

114 2019-04-13 22:17:46 Modern stocks however don't really play by the rules of supply vs. demand, now it is just rumors. Like how a tech company in 90s could gain suddenly a lot of investment without actually having a product to sell.
115 2019-04-13 22:17:29 Buy treasures until the market falls between 19-21K (Dow) then buy stocks after it drops to that point.  Buy dividend payers and re-invest the dividends.  Hold for 10 years.
116 2019-04-13 22:16:26 Yep- stocks existed a trifle before that (which was about 400 years ago) but that was indeed when an initial market was created.

128 2019-04-13 22:02:27 & you're correct btw- there was an economy before the stock market existed but as long as import & export companies have existed - which is over 500 years, stocks have existed, they've gotten far less "exclusive" through the centuries though in "who has it".
129 2019-04-13 22:01:07 You’re conflating again. He’s not advocating to lower his taxes because he’s a jobs creator. Then afterwards lays off thousands of employees... he’s also not claiming to bring jobs back to America and then buying back stocks to inflate the company value...

145 2019-04-13 21:29:30 He died doing what he loved most: shorting stocks, buying gold, and screaming about Fed conspiracies.
146 2019-04-13 21:29:23 3. I’m not sure why you mean by “corporate stocks”, but as I mentioned in number one, the decreased number of stocks available could make the remaining stocks more valuable. This is a benefit for all stock holders, not just the business.
147 2019-04-13 21:27:38 rt @MemphisJohnny1  By their standards he would be sitting in stocks while citizens would be provided rotten tomatoes to throw at him or even worse he would be challenged to a duel.
148 2019-04-13 21:26:23 Because they have other financial interests and motivations. 
Either shorting #tesla directly or owning oil and gas stocks, legacy automaker stocks or insurance stocks. 

That's why you even see Warren Buffett go against Elon.
149 2019-04-13 21:25:15 Your statement is wrong on a few points. 
1. Buying back stocks do not dilute the private shareholders. It actually reduces the number of them. One added effect of this is the common stock price could increase because of the decreased amount of shares available.

151 2019-04-13 21:23:55 At least he didn’t enrich himself by lowering his taxes and investing in stocks that he passed laws on...
152 2019-04-13 21:22:50 it's idiotic to say that the economy can only grow as fast as the gold stocks.

It's ignorant of history. And it's ignorant of monetary theory.

Good luck.
153 2019-04-13 21:21:38 How did they aquire that wealth?  Legal inside trading of stocks?   Friendly interpretation of banking regs for community bank owners? (Pelosi).  Overlooked FEC inquiries?  Watters.   People get into politics for 1 narcissistic reasons.  2 money.

- Change yourself, not the climate.  
- Protect your children, not your stocks  

- Act on climate. Don't hope for a hero.
167 2019-04-13 21:09:07 you’re right. i don’t know much about guns. i know that only hunters and dumb pussies need them, but that doesn’t mean i want them taken away. 

semi and bump stocks too.
168 2019-04-13 21:08:46 I’m personally cashing out my stocks with them. This was my final straw. I was suspended for calling Laura Ingram white trash, they allow this. If more people would follow suit, maybe it would make them have the same standards across the board.
169 2019-04-13 21:07:40 My combos miss, my stocks get taken, and it all just loops around and I'll probably play just as worse next round. And yet apart of me knows just to relax and yet I can't, I feel out of place like someone just put me there and no one cares about what happens.

201 2019-04-13 20:32:41 What I don’t get is that you would be willing to vote for tRump again if you think anyone would suggest banning bump stocks and high powered assault rifles. Truly, which is more dangerous?
202 2019-04-13 20:31:57 A scandal about their credibility isn't a small thing, tho. Especially if it's about them adding views to the vids they "promote" and delete from the "competition". Whatever impacts the market & the stocks brings changes.

236 2019-04-13 19:54:27 We are coming out of a decade of enormous equity returns into a period of of 2% GDP and 2% inflation. The last thing you want to own is all 500 of the largest stocks in the US. Managers who own 20-50 and can pick their spots are poised to tear the indexes up.
237 2019-04-13 19:54:00 Stocks does lose real quick up in there. Like they literally have a black hole up in that place.
238 2019-04-13 19:52:34 You're picking the right stocks & use of the stop is fine, even if you were hedged. Seems you need a rule to get you right back in. Especially, on a leader. Jump back in on a weekly close back above the 10 week MA, as long as it's still rising (something along those lines). jmho

250 2019-04-13 19:39:10 Trump and Amazon avoiding taxes is legal, too. They take advantage of the same tax codes, that rewards instruments of wealth like stocks and property, as Sanders does. Most Americans can’t use these tools to pay much lower tax rates like he does. We call this “hypocrisy”.
251 2019-04-13 19:37:46 It’s true that he took every advantage of the tax code, or likely his college bankrupting wife did, to lower his tax bill to as low as possible. That means he is not trying to pay more in taxes. He’s hiding wealth in low tax entities like property and stocks do avoid taxes.

253 2019-04-13 19:36:25 I don't get this thinking on new tech. It's like a different version of too big to fail. Also, with investment trillions in stocks yet to move over to crypto, it's way too early to call. Bitcoin has first to market advantage, but so did AOL and Netscape.
254 2019-04-13 19:35:47 I am not defending him, my tweet is about personal accountability. No one can have a truly informed opinion on thousands of stocks. I have no idea why a network would give ANYONE 2 hours a day to opine, I make no claim of knowing his motivation but clearly buyer beware with him.
255 2019-04-13 19:32:47 It’s so comforting knowing that he and others like him manipulate the market with their buy and sell strategies and the little guys like me get shafted when the stocks lose 50%, and our President shares what a great economy we have, he creates the other 50% loss w/tarriffs

The back story of the gift is Kanye bought her a major part of the stocks of those companies. I’m telling you Kanye smarter then everyone thinks he is.
274 2019-04-13 19:15:54 Sectionals update: Julius (Kirby main) takes the 2 game lead over Charles (bowser main.) In the other side of the bracket, Fogel is consistently taking 3 stocks off of every single one of his opponents using Jugglypuff.
275 2019-04-13 19:15:49 Yeah, anyway cause the scum have many stocks, FNC can't fired him, right?  In fact, I wish FNC & LJH go to the hell together.
276 2019-04-13 19:15:11 For what it's worth I think (at least in America) real estate assets are likely to outperform stocks in the next ten-twenty years. (Depending on to what extent the former can be 'passivized')

280 2019-04-13 19:12:17 I know the S plan follows the S&P500 which means stock are owned. The L (I think) is a timed maturity bond fund but I think the bonds are all government bonds thus no stocks.  Not asking you to tell me which funds, only informing you.
I’m retired CSRS but had TSP, in my IRA now
281 2019-04-13 19:11:53 You’re spot on Scott. It beggars belief how and why Uber let Lyft beat them to an IPO. I’m now getting very curious if Uber have done it knowing their stocks will plummet.......for what benefit, I have no idea. Maybe they’ve done it to stitch up their largest investor.

283 2019-04-13 19:11:12 Corn has likely seen highest acreage estimate of the year. The expected acres combined with trend ylds will make May’s 2019 production estimate large.  Combined with more old crop stocks, any rally potential has been dampened. Weather will not be an issue until after May 1.
284 2019-04-13 19:09:07 I’m really considering going semi vegetarian, like no more eating meat but I’ll still use meat stocks in my cooking & bacon fat.. eating meat has just been making me feel like crap more recently.

312 2019-04-13 18:51:19 Which candidate is calling for “open borders?”  And, there is no existing wall.. there are sections of fence. Also, there are candidates who want better background checks and banning unnecessary bump stocks. Who do you see calling for completely banning guns?
313 2019-04-13 18:51:13 Yuge! 

If Trump can even somewhat level the trade deficit with China, revenues & stocks will shoot up. More income, wage increases as well

335 2019-04-13 18:33:29 Know the difference between investors, swing traders and P&D traders. Don't follow blindly to buy stocks that tank off bad data. Many will do not recover from their fall, listen to the market. Look at $OPTH $ACIU $PTI $NVAX which gets all those SA, Motley Fool, Zach's articles
336 2019-04-13 18:33:21 I had planned to do 10 acres but only planted 4.5 acres. Trying to figure out how to salvage this season. 2 seasons of failed rains is really bad. Good seeds stocks are depleting.
337 2019-04-13 18:32:44 ur going at it the other way round. Educate the masses to carry fabric bags and charge huge taxes on the plastic bags. Uk has managed this issue gradually 5p per bag. Learn from them. Burning stocks of poor vendors is not the answer

340 2019-04-13 18:30:20 Ok dummy.  Yeah you're right, I forgot the nightly news on September 11th 2001 began with Tom Brokaw saying "some people did something.....and in other news stocks were down.  Al how's the weekend weather outlook ?" #SomePeopleDidSomething
341 2019-04-13 18:29:57 Future and options have never the same risk, even if the Deltas are equated. Very recent example being 2 quality stocks in financial sector. One being Kotak Mahindra Bank which went down intra day by 12 percent after the RBI stricture on Promoter holding issue and contd /2

343 2019-04-13 18:28:45 For all our emphasis on ephemerality, you’d think we’d buy stocks. Instead we invest in something we believe will survive the apocalypse, with the faint hope that there will still be eye doctors.
344 2019-04-13 18:28:39 NRA has come under attack by its and GOA for being soft on defending bump stocks.
345 2019-04-13 18:27:30 How about a specific instead of broad generalizations. The left is using Alinsky rules. Isolate an attack. It isolated a gun safety org that defends the 2nd instead of one that defends bump stocks and another that sells retired military surplus rifles.

352 2019-04-13 18:22:09 Excellent advise for those in ETFs, Mutual Funds, & asset allocation.  If you are in stocks, might want to pay closer attention.

355 2019-04-13 18:19:53 Many of these companies have been great wealth creators for shareholders. So maybe instead of buying that 96-inch OLED TV maybe buy stocks (and pay lower capital gains tax rates to boot).
356 2019-04-13 18:19:29 Bump stocks are now banned. Modifying a firearm to fire automatically is a Federal Offense. Aside from Vegas, I can't recall a shooting in the US with auto weapons since LA in the late 80s or early 90s. If 90+% of mass shootings are in gun free zones, isn't the zone the problem?

360 2019-04-13 18:16:58 The economy was already roaring when Trump took office... Sure, stocks go up when you deregulate industry & dismiss environmental protections, but is the middle class getting closer in wealth to the upper class? No, the middle class is shrinking and the rich are getting richer

364 2019-04-13 18:07:45 Trump is Hillary Clinton in slow motion.  Democrats are getting everything they want from him - open borders, gun control (red flag laws, bump stocks), more military interventions, prison release for drug dealers, fully funded Planned Parenthood, etc. What more do you want?
365 2019-04-13 18:06:51 1 Half; 2 irrelevant, all citizens would be automatically enrolled; 3 didn't stop us from building telephones when telegraph workers would lose their jobs; 4 I could give a fuck about insurance company stock. You have stocks, hmm? 80% of all stocks are controlled by the 1%.

370 2019-04-13 18:04:08 I think you are onto something very big here patriot. It made me think right away about the market manipulation that we see on wallstreet every day....the put options on days before 9/11...the massive sell offs of stocks or buy options before certain events globally..
371 2019-04-13 18:03:55 I read that Sen. Rubio proposes taxing buybacks.  
Seems to make sense.  Also, if companies are not allowed to buy back stocks, would they also be less inclined to issue them in the first place?

406 2019-04-13 17:31:25 I agree, it is interesting though reading others perspective even though I disagree with it. In the same manner I am somewhat bemused by folks selling #Uranium stocks in advance of any recommendations on s232, when it could impact big time on U prices. Unless they know something?
407 2019-04-13 17:31:18 Good 
If new stocks arrive 
I’ll buzz you
408 2019-04-13 17:30:03 Our America $ stats:
The 90% have lost net worth recently...most of that lost wealth has gone to the 1%.
The 1% now own over 1/2 of all stocks in US companies.
And trump called for another tax cut for the wealthy...
409 2019-04-13 17:29:29 Another thing you might want to do is a money market account (I think that’s what it’s called don’t quote me), it’ll be invested in stocks and earn more interest than a savings account while doing something similar
410 2019-04-13 17:29:29 You got three stocks to figure it out lol, how hard is that? It’s only four moves, the A moves are constant so you always have them to worry about.
411 2019-04-13 17:28:39 I've been telling you since you made your debut on @MLW that "if there is ever STOCKS of you available I want to invest because your stock is on the rise" and you are rising faster than the sun. Proud to see a fellow  doing her thing #HastaLaMuerte
412 2019-04-13 17:27:57 It would be interesting to do a study on the average  net gain in last 10 years for #US seniors from stocks and house price increases versus loss in income from drop in interest rates. Have to factor in #UST value gains etc. Has anyone modelled this?
413 2019-04-13 17:25:42 Why? Do they realize we don't care? We have a great economy. Great returns on our stocks, and this is what the Democrats  want to do? Party of clowns! #MAGA
414 2019-04-13 17:24:38 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the Trump administration’s move to ban bump stocks (all times local):

3:55 p.m.

The National Rifle Association is “disappointed” with the Trump administration’s plan to outlaw bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire continuously
415 2019-04-13 17:24:18 Yea, Govt using it as a slush fund has worked out so well. lol
That's how the fund was designed to operate and was before Reagan. If the fund was invested in US Treasuries it would be better off. It doesn't have to be stocks.
416 2019-04-13 17:22:22 I'm thinking it holds up through options expiration Thursday
 then Monday after Good Friday things could start  getting interesting

I think it all depends on how the tech stocks $Sox reacts when company start reporting earnings
$ASML Wednesday
417 2019-04-13 17:20:27 You never going to Hell bro, I just been trying to buy stocks in weed firms they say it’s suppose to be a boom in 2022

423 2019-04-13 17:17:00 "There is a sort of vast cycle of 
flows of production and chains of inscription, and a lesser cycle, between the stocks of filiation that connect or encaste (encastent) the flows, and the blocks of alliance that cause the chains to flow."

427 2019-04-13 17:14:46 @realDonaldTrump  if you want to serve another term as president, I would strongly recommend that you stop allowing gun control. By allowing the ban on bump stocks, you betrayed your voters.
428 2019-04-13 17:13:53 That's where I stand. I know I'm not ready for a big account. I haven't even started with a money account yet because I can't get my greed under control. The psychology is the hardest part. But I agree to take it slow and in a few months we will be killing it!

432 2019-04-13 17:10:45 Your so gun smart.  Don’t need gunsplaining.  Need to have NRA’s explanation of why it opposes banning bump stocks.
433 2019-04-13 17:10:29 You only want deals that put Money in Your Pocket. Like Health Care, you either own, have stocks in or receive kickbacks from certain Insurance Companies. That’s why u messed with the ACA there were too many Ins Companies that weren’t yours.
434 2019-04-13 17:10:01 I want to invest in some stocks when I get older 
435 2019-04-13 17:09:54 Percentage of NYSE stocks above the 200-day line reached 60% Friday, the highest in about 15 months. That reading isn't extreme. An extreme low was reached Dec. 24 when only 8% of NYSE stocks were above the key line.
436 2019-04-13 17:09:39 He owns stocks in Naver and has kept BTS stuff from trending. They'd been making moves since 2015, and yet the only things that have trended under their name in naver have been bad stuff. You cant blame us for pointing out the obvious
437 2019-04-13 17:09:38 @jimcramer if you had $1500 to invest right now what 2-3 stocks you looking at? Need some advice
438 2019-04-13 17:08:44 Sell pharma stocks buy Farm stocks. I just struck a deal for cheap labor
439 2019-04-13 17:07:37 11. Tax income from stocks and dividends at the same rate as ordinary income. This would raise a huge amount of money from Caesar Trump 's 1% Elite buddies!

452 2019-04-13 16:59:54 Sounds like what you want is a savings account, stocks are “better” in the sense of making more money, but for easily accessible, minimum risk money that accrues some interest, savings is the way to go
453 2019-04-13 16:57:35 see, its all “maybe” for yall..yall are speculating and pass it as confirmation that yg, a company with falling stocks after scandals, is paying these multimillion dollar companies to delete bts’ youtube views..make it make sense..armys render me speechless everytime..gosh
454 2019-04-13 16:57:16 Till the time we have people managing and running #KOTAK FMP and investing hard earned money of investors in shitty business knowing well the outcome, we will get chance to add stocks again at lower levels which one missed earlier.
455 2019-04-13 16:56:50 Hi Talal, the stop loss itself is not the problem for retail traders going broke. The problem is the placement of stop losses. If an individual is buying extended stocks and then placing a stop right below the market then they are much more likely to get stopped out.
456 2019-04-13 16:56:42 Well Mr. President you need to go to work and help GrubHub their stocks are WAY down. Ha. No one should yell at you. For any reason. And we shouldn't let people talk to us that way. It's harder in business whether it's a company like yours or delivering food. But there's limits.

460 2019-04-13 16:55:46 what about funds for public employees' pensions who are invested in those stocks? do part of their pensions disappear? 

I'm not saying that these are unsolvable problems. I'm just saying it's not as simple as "let's wave a magic wand and make private insurance disappear."
461 2019-04-13 16:55:40 Hi Lorna, the code will be running as long as stocks last. Many thanks, #MATeam
462 2019-04-13 16:54:18 when their previous profession has disappeared, will cause an enormous upheaval. 

Let's also talk about health insurance companies. Many are publicly held. What happens to their stocks? Do they just disappear? Who compensates for their lost value?
463 2019-04-13 16:52:46 I'm gonna be looking at several other stocks this week I'm interested in, But right now it's $GNMX & $SYN that are HIGHLY UNDERVALUED! Remember, I was telling you all about $VTL, $HSGX & $YUMA before most others were even talking about it. So many opportunities out there.

487 2019-04-13 16:30:29 Only 2 assets in the world appreciate: businesses/stocks and real estate. The first for obvious reasons, and the second because of finite resources. A house can be remodeled; a car not so much. And cars deteriorate WAY quicker.

I am long a couple stocks and I have one which I will make money in if it just stays where it is right now so. I am long $ACB $KNDI $NIO and want $FGEN to stay at $50.

498 2019-04-13 16:22:51 So, climate change has replaced 100's of foreign trawlers for the disappearance of fish stocks. Duh.... who thought that up??
499 2019-04-13 16:22:16 Where the hell are these people getting the money to sink into garbage stocks in the first place?

The Fed obviously hasn't raised rates enough.

Oh Lord, TARP II is going to be a bailout of retail baggies, isn't it? They're too powerful now, they can't be stopped..
500 2019-04-13 16:21:47 True... but I look at pot stocks like I do my gambling...( I know bad analogy).. I set aside a certain percentage of my portfolio for pot stocks and swing trades and the rest is safe dividend stocks... If I crash and burn so be it...I'm willing to take the risk...
501 2019-04-13 16:21:37 Stock bottom formations are different from tops - you can find the research, but basically these indicators are good at getting the bottoms but stocks can continue to rise after new 52-week highs.

520 2019-04-13 16:07:15 @Nifty11491Mode Mam I see a sharp rise in the prices of some beaten down stocks I hold like PCJ, Vakrangee, Rain Ind. Why does this imply for the overall market?
521 2019-04-13 16:07:10 4) rebuild Beute tanks which will take capacity of your heavy workshops or factories; 5) capture or manufacture sufficient stocks of spares and ammunition; if captured you need to feed them back up your logistics chain a if manufactured you’re not manufacturing something else;
522 2019-04-13 16:07:05 Excellent idea!  Any how their add says A2Z can be purchased through them. In this case why can’t they sell airline and even its stocks also. Our stock brokers can be their agents.
523 2019-04-13 16:05:57 correct!
524 2019-04-13 16:05:32 This is great! It's all about scalability. Think about if you added a 0 to the end of your position size. 2900 instead of 290. You'll make $783 instead of $78.3. The entry/exit is what matters. You can always change your size later and make more $. The real win is your knowledge.
525 2019-04-13 16:04:44 The guy is good. I just posted it because it helps to explain some of the moves on Friday. My hypothesis that the quant world was positioned the wrong way in several stocks and had to deleverage. I mean, seeing $DIS up 10% on an expected announcement was quite unusual.
526 2019-04-13 16:02:27 Guess I'll go back to trading stocks and getting rich.....since it's every man for himself anyway. Just be like everyone else and buy my stairway to heaven. BTW "the lady" I believe to be the USA.

532 2019-04-13 15:56:34 Hollywood televangelists who preach from their pulpits daily on how regular Americans shld think, live, & vote. Yet when given what they want from the president, they turn into the biggest hypocrites ever. Hollywood needs boycotted, they live off brands & stocks.
533 2019-04-13 15:54:59 There would be couple of ways to approach the asset: directly via physical gold fund/etf or gold mining industry stocks (barricks for example). Stocks typically offer some operational leverage & risk. Which one might be better choice once the shit hits the fan?

535 2019-04-13 15:54:48 I am still not clear on what differentiates an "assault weapon" from a run of the mill semiauto rifle, except that they are apparently the black, scary looking ones. How about we just make a rule that all rifles must have nice, non threatening wooden stocks. Problem solved!

546 2019-04-13 15:50:15 typically no, but the market has reacted to the tremendous GDP #'s, unemployment #'s, and consumer confidence #'s thus driving up the stock market and thus the value of portfolios that invest in stocks.Rarely has a President drastically changed so many indicators at the same time
547 2019-04-13 15:49:59 Personal finance tip from my mentors and advisors over the last few years:

Step 1: Chose a fixed monthly expense (Ex. Mortgage, car payment, rent, etc.)

Step 2: Find an asset that cashflows 50%+ of that monthly expense 
(Ex. Real estate, stocks w/dividends, blog, youtube, etc.)

554 2019-04-13 15:46:39 Don’t know if this is true or not, but if it is ... so what?  Just remember who there were Muslims terrorists that killed 3k innocent people and because of this terrorist attack thousands lost their savings, jobs, buildings... stocks... it’s their fault
555 2019-04-13 15:45:57 What is hoarding? Buying real estate? Poor people maintain it. Stocks?  Poor people do the bookkeeping. Actively investing in a business? Poor, do most of the work!

There's no place you can put £ that won't benefit the poor, cuz they're  all over. Only way to waste money? Taxes.
556 2019-04-13 15:45:52 Damn seriously?!? That’s awesome. I’m at $130 from money I don’t even see. I like that it’s vanguard funds too. 
You’re right. Don’t think you can do partial shares with Robinhood. What was that one company where you could buy stocks with credit cards? Crazy!

576 2019-04-13 15:34:55 She is fab !
577 2019-04-13 15:34:32 Also though, if you can ride out a steady stock for decades that can cover inflation and gain long term, it essentially free money.. Or get lucky with some penny stocks, again free money! Everything comes at a risk

584 2019-04-13 15:32:28 I’m with both of you! Diversifying your portfolio can typically help eliminate total loss! Penny stocks/long term investments are a decent way to compensate income. Usually low risk/low reward.. The safe bet! If you can buy a shoe today for $200 and sell for $400 today.. y not
585 2019-04-13 15:31:52 @JohnnieVibes 100% not a scammer as people know what they are getting in for. It's a free market and they can make a choice. Same a stocks. You know you can win or lose. A scammer will tell you that they have inside information that's false

587 2019-04-13 15:31:16 Stocks and bonds! That's where the real money is! It can get you financially free where you won't have to work I'm building a team of people who are investing into themselves and I think you should give t a try! You can make money while you're sleeping literally lol

590 2019-04-13 15:29:30 It looks as though they are doing it the right way, some organizations feel that fish farms are part of a sustainable fishery and that is wrong, proven to cause more damage to existing wild stocks than non-selective fishing techniques

592 2019-04-13 15:28:31 For investors considering media stocks right now keep in mind in the very near future the TV/Movie Writers Guild is set to vote on mass exit of all agency contracts over the issue of agency packaging. A vote of yes will bring chaos to the industry.

594 2019-04-13 15:27:48 I’m streaming AND trending this though, in my opinion it’ll make YOUTUBE look bad and their stocks will probably go down

601 2019-04-13 15:20:44 Surely it would make sense to implement a similar system in Scotland? If you have local fishermen, fishing their own waters they will become guardians and curators rather than participants in an annual 'goldrush' where stocks get fished to death? @marinescotland @DefraGovUK
602 2019-04-13 15:18:47 Most of the major stocks look like they finished wave 4s which is scary if anything lol
603 2019-04-13 15:18:31 I’m still heavily invested in stocks, and bonds account for only 20% of my portfolio. It’s hard to tell what to do rn. S&P has been rocketing, they don’t seem deterred by recession indicators.

607 2019-04-13 15:15:03 The craziest part will be those nouveaux rich will start granting interviews and will be called the new kids on the block. All due to taking advantage of insider trading and strategy to dump worthless stocks on people.
608 2019-04-13 15:14:38 #Trump’s apparently adulteress relationship with reality (an effort to manufacture a new nihilism via fatigue), distracts as he stocks his administration with lobbyists and those who follow orders. The dovetailing of these motions is inciting irrationality among the desperate.

615 2019-04-13 15:10:01 You’re right Adam, they don’t owe us anything. And they are doing what’s best for the company. For 6 months the stocks been averaged flat/down with two big raises...at the end of the day that’s on me for holding LEAPS in a company that is focused on growth over share value.

662 2019-04-13 14:35:20 It doesn’t come out till next week, they’ll probably get more stock in. Heaps of stocks in Australia though haha I’m still contemplating as a secondary phone.
663 2019-04-13 14:35:19 Depends on companies, as many stocks are covered in these magazines, only 2-3 are worth studying every week
664 2019-04-13 14:32:29 Tech stocks are pretty exciting but it needs to be on a hot sector, I am always on the look out for them, more then ever before with AI & Sci-fi type technology heading our way.

667 2019-04-13 14:30:43 @Honeystocks not XLV in  particular, but many stocks in this sector looking ready to rollover or already doing it
668 2019-04-13 14:29:39 Stocks @fresh all-time high

As many as 13 stocks on the BSE500 hit their fresh all-time highs. The list includes stocks such as ICICI Lombard Life Insurance, Gillette India, Bajaj Finserv, PVR, SKF India, Pidilite, Honeywell Automation, Info Edge (India) and Infosys.
669 2019-04-13 14:29:15 Pain for 3 scrips
Just three stocks such as Century Plyboards (down 11.53 per cent), PNB Housing Finance (down 11.86 per cent) and Reliance Communications (down 22 per cent) on the BSE500 plunged in double digits.
670 2019-04-13 14:28:34 David, can i ask you....do you not see ANY way that the Dow could hit 35k-50k in the next few years?..some on here saying we really are at a big melt up stage...and lots of stocks breaking out to highs again??..thanks
671 2019-04-13 14:28:26 Stocks that rallied up to 30%

672 2019-04-13 14:28:16 Yasss  ouais les stocks font peur 
673 2019-04-13 14:26:24 So you are Trading Stocks and Not Investing.

678 2019-04-13 14:20:29 This why gamestop is going out of business in the next few years, stocks value super low, CEO s quitting. Former employees talking about it on YouTube...
679 2019-04-13 14:20:03 I’ve been long $JPM & $DIS since the birth of our 1st born son. I would have never imagined these 2 #stocks would have done so well. Thank you #StockMarket!
680 2019-04-13 14:20:00 Who hit this morning?? I was to busy looking at the stocks of the shoes that I forgot to actually enter and purchase  I just want the money.
681 2019-04-13 14:19:08 Yup I agree cannot wait for Tuesday.  Buy stocks in Kleenex be lots of lefty tears Tuesday
682 2019-04-13 14:19:00 1/ In the end opinions about who is it isn’t satoshi won’t matter. Right now the whole #bitcoin & #crypto space is a piss in the ocean in comparison to developed markets (stocks, bonds, derivatives) opinions mean the square root of fuck all in a market as young as this.

684 2019-04-13 14:18:25 Sounds douche-y, but I search for articles on “Building a Buffet style portfolio”
Some are click bait, but you do get some good ones.
Watch YouTube videos on it too. You want stocks with a “moat” at the moment. As you need to know the company will ride out a depression
685 2019-04-13 14:17:25 stocks ?
i don't have a savings account
686 2019-04-13 14:16:47 Non, c’est les fins de série. L’hiver est fini au Canada. On écoule les stocks avec les plumes des oies blanches. Celles qui sont les plus perméables!

688 2019-04-13 14:14:21 Hiya pals,

I want to do some long-term investing in stocks with my @freetrade account, but I’m pretty useless at knowing what to invest in.

Anyone got any tips for nice, stable stocks?
689 2019-04-13 14:13:58 The way a simple mention from these boys of a certain product managed to sell the stocks all over the world dear @YouTube and @youtubemusic the same way a simple sadness on their face will make us boycott all the brands that chose to pay advertisement on your platform!
690 2019-04-13 14:13:37 apple stocks rise by 30%.
691 2019-04-13 14:13:08 Most working class folks don't have stocks either&unless you're over 50- I don't see that you'd be likely at all to have a retirement account at all either- so we're talking about mostly the rich &almost nonexistent middle-class. Dow indexes always rise&individual stocks r risky.
692 2019-04-13 14:12:49 Me: Persona’s cover looks like a perception map for consumer insight
Nabeela: I hope YouTube’s stocks take a hit

695 2019-04-13 14:10:12 everything is rockin making new all time highs...I thought this interest rate inversion was a death signal for stocks, apparently debt, interest rates cant stop the momentum wonder what it will take, probably keep rallying until Trump gets us into a real war, that wont stop it
696 2019-04-13 14:08:51 Studying business is getting to me I really went straight for their stocks.... right where it should hurt

702 2019-04-13 14:06:19 are u hinting steel stocks?
703 2019-04-13 14:06:02 People hear "invest" and automatically think stocks or shit like that but an investment can be anything from a notebook to write things down to a course that'll make you more money in whatever you do. Learn to invest in yourself.
704 2019-04-13 14:03:12 WE ARE STREAMING BACK THOSE VIEWS AND I FUCKING DARE YOU TO DELETE OUR VIEWS AGAIN AND I SWEAR TO GOD YOU'LL FUCKING SEE 75% OF YOUR STOCKS IN OUR HANDS. DONT FUCKING TEST OUR POWER.
705 2019-04-13 14:02:54 We are talking about decades. Long term, stocks will outstrip inflation on average. 

I have a sneaking suspicion we'll have to agree to disagree about these things.  
706 2019-04-13 14:02:50 Im fcking pissed too but with what happened to idol i expected worse than 10m. Trending a tag or @-ing them wont put a dent on yt's stocks. Theyre still the biggest platform. But armys will get twice the brunt bec we'll get more views deleted+it will distract them
707 2019-04-13 14:01:58 My goal is Marriage 40+plus years. 3-5 kids. 6-10 grandkids. Generational wealth, properties, stocks&bonds, and a family business to be inherited when my times up.
708 2019-04-13 14:01:36 Inv are betting this saves stocks again but before we had some form of global synch growth going on. Not anymore. Debt levels are now extreme and choking consumers/corps/govn. All the CB capitulation for economies thst can not hold life support right now. Something changes soon
709 2019-04-13 14:00:24 Guys it ain’t too late. Prepare for Monday and go get those Wigton stocks. 

(Not a financial advisor, so don’t take this as financial advice)
710 2019-04-13 13:58:41 Stocks prices are derived by two things: earnings and expectations. Tesla earnings are shit and expectations are even worse. $50 stock
711 2019-04-13 13:58:22 @BernieSanders ... political opportunist, owns stocks in wall street, socialist? my ass, #sexist,
712 2019-04-13 13:57:42 How many different coins/currencies/stocks are you looking at in this time period?
713 2019-04-13 13:57:22 Most auto stocks seem to have bottomed out IMO. Liking Maruti and M&M of the entire pack
714 2019-04-13 13:57:12 Do you have real economic power?  Do you own a home, own a business, have a 720 plus credit score, own investment accounts (stocks, bonds, annuities) or have savings above $5000?  Traveling and wearing designer labels is nice but do you have wealth and financial stability?
715 2019-04-13 13:56:56 These guys just found a way to scale this up to the big level of listed stocks

Promises of we will make profits in future used to be important but I think its mostly noise

Anybody buying in2 this model is actual  purely betting on the stock, that somebody else will buy in2 this

721 2019-04-13 13:53:40 Statistically cheap stocks are usually cheap for specific reasons. To own, one should have a clear understanding of why the biz is cheap AND a differentiated view on either i) the quality/durability of profits, or ii) actions currently being undertaken to improve its management

735 2019-04-13 13:38:59 How many did you bought? They are out of stocks I guess.
736 2019-04-13 13:38:20 You can’t compare to two eras. Fed policies have inflated asset prices (stocks and homes, owned by boomers) while at the same time keeping rates at historic lows for 10+ years. Policies have a goal; disincentive saving. It’s working.

745 2019-04-13 13:29:43 Hindustan tin, Sakuma Exports were once available at throw away price, now also available at dirt price they r growing negative. Avoid recommendation made by these magazines. Stocks must be taken only after verifying from all angles.
746 2019-04-13 13:28:13 Oh really? You should have bought stocks on Inauguration Day.  You’d be loaded now.  You guys are just pissed you have to work now with all these jobs. 
747 2019-04-13 13:27:06 Agree with you mainly as Macro backdrop still looking awful. Monetary trends deteriorating still, implying global macro bottom won't be for 9 months or longer. Why do stocks tend to crash in September / October? Wondering if this year could be similar to 29 and 08?

Disgraceful on you & deposit my money  in my account as u have deducted #ShameAxis
751 2019-04-13 13:25:21 Since the dismissal of the gold backed U.S dollar the value of the bill has been dropping like a rock. Meanwhile the central bank has went rogue, by printing unlimited dollars to pump up failed assets and rescue zombie corporations that pay zero taxes and buy back their stocks.
752 2019-04-13 13:25:02 Buy stocks you will feel better.  Or get a job.

773 2019-04-13 13:07:23 So what happens with throttling when ther's a full court press to get out of stocks?
Will orders get dropped 'cause this has the semblance of something similar - buffer overflow on a router where packets get dropped when there' too many to process?

775 2019-04-13 13:03:14 I'd recommend CHK(energy)due to summer drawing closer and the company seems undervalued compared to peers. ACB (weed): potential to boom through new deals even though stocks appear diluted. GME(gamestop): as a company to bet against since streaming is taking over.
776 2019-04-13 13:03:10 Of course banks are part of the financial sector. So are stocks, bonds, insurance, etc.  All those elements are necessary in an economy but are also subject to abuse. The goal is to minimize abuse and maximize utility. They are inherently risky but potentially rewarding.
777 2019-04-13 13:02:43 That some people are not good investors despite using math is well known. Garbage In, garbage out. This does not make relying on the tooth fairy in picking stocks a good idea.
778 2019-04-13 13:02:05 Recommendation. Don’t have to have your life together if your saving. I put $100 away in stocks/bonds every pay check since I was 18. Guess whose got 300k and he’s not even 30. Save wisely (moderately) and steadily then you can be a hot mess still trying to figure it out.

792 2019-04-13 12:54:42 My guess is Pentagon put $21 Trillion into propping up profits from currency exchanges, commodities markets, and stocks, so it doesn't crash, because more money goes out, than goes in; artificially stimulated world markets. China does it also. When the money is gone...
793 2019-04-13 12:54:25 Good evening from Malaysia. Just finished screening stocks for Malaysia stock market. Now having a quality time with family  have a good weekend sir.
794 2019-04-13 12:54:19 Really no need for sexism. I respect anyone’s right to protection. And I agree with right to own all those weapons except assault rifles, high cap mags and bump stocks. It crosses a line because there’s no need and they’ve absolutely done more social harm than practical good.

811 2019-04-13 12:33:21 If your #retirement account doesn’t rebalance automatically bc you have an adviser or a target date #mutualfund, you should consider shifting a little from #stocks to #bonds and alternative assets after this recent #stockmarket rally. Particularly true if you’re near retirement.
812 2019-04-13 12:32:52 Minnesota Democrats should be embarrassed for being such stupid voters. They are the laughing stocks of the USA.
813 2019-04-13 12:31:57 Should’ve invested in these stocks earlier in my liiiiiiiiife 
814 2019-04-13 12:31:54 Let me think about a nice plot !! I've got some in stocks lol
815 2019-04-13 12:31:38 2/ this is a @federalreserve disaster by refusing to deal with the real economy in 09 and ever since. They don't know what to do and are doing everything they csn to keep stocks elevated. They beli ve what JY said, if stocks go down it all goes down. We used to talk about

Is it bedtime yet?

817 2019-04-13 12:29:47 Greenspan is wrong. In the past stocks rose on growth in the real economy of 6-10% GDPs. GDP is 2% avg since 09. The 3% GDPs of last 18 months were artificial - hurricane/wildfire rebuilds + trade war stocking. We won't see a 3% GDP on higher stocks. Q1 is 1% w/ stocks at ATH.
818 2019-04-13 12:29:42 C'est lui le directeur, il a quand même le droit de gérer les stocks !
819 2019-04-13 12:29:00 In a low interest rate, high liquidity environment, money is going into stocks which are rising faster than gold because of low inflation, how and when does this cycle change?

If Clinton won we'd have NOTHING!

836 2019-04-13 12:11:12 Brutal. Brent Crude is completely undervalued. Dump any stocks with an 'E' in the ticker.
837 2019-04-13 12:10:44 Opgevallen hoe de uranium stocks weer slaag kregen vrijdag? Volgens mij een sell the rumour, buy the news event coming!
838 2019-04-13 12:10:12 @investockoholic would also be sharing Futures Positions to be held for stocks. We provide a combination of futures positions i.e. 1 from Buy & Sell each. We recommend holding onto the combination which is necessary for downside risk protection in case of adverse market movement.
839 2019-04-13 12:09:49 I love it when Chris talks stocks! 

It would be great if you would spend more time on this. I know investing is kind of a hobby of yours and I'd love to learn from you. 

I know your '18 pick of the year was UA. (worst performing of entire S&P). 

Who are you riding for '19?
840 2019-04-13 12:09:19 Someone gains admission, comes online to post pictures of her matriculation and she's been ridiculed.

May we never be laughing stocks to idiot's online who we may obviously not get to meet in the real world.
841 2019-04-13 12:07:47 He's a scammer. I don't know the particular base-scam (real estate, penny stocks, laudnerettes) & don't need to, the real scam is getting people to pay him to explain how to be rich, like Tony Robbins.
842 2019-04-13 12:07:32 April is good this time for pot stocks. ACB looking to break high.
843 2019-04-13 12:07:06 So true! These momentum stocks are usually short-term trades for me. I don't marry momentum stocks. I usually buy stocks for the long-term who pay me monthly or quarterly... with AMZN being an exception....
844 2019-04-13 12:06:46 And Microsoft is the golden child example of what happens when growth stocks flame out as it didn't do anything for 10+ years earlier this century.
845 2019-04-13 12:05:33 I know that Apple  had to buy back a lot of their stocks and most companies gave one time bonuses to their employees!
846 2019-04-13 12:04:39 I don't know but value stocks out perform over longer periods because you are buying them cheaply. Just because a stock has out performed for several years doesn't mean it will going forward.
847 2019-04-13 12:04:35 Right!? Mike is on CNBC picking stocks & HGTV flipping houses 
848 2019-04-13 12:04:14 We've outlawed the ownership of fully automatic weapons (aka ACTUAL military style weapons), outlawed Bump Stocks. Many States (which is where these changes should occur) have limited magazine capacities & have requirements for gun use. All these changes & anything else you

851 2019-04-13 12:03:35 I hear that, I invest in a lot of dividend/secure paying stocks that you can pretty much invest in a forget about your cash, and it'll be fine. Such big Pharma, but yh I hear you. I'll have to have a look into apps that do that, never really trusted them lol
852 2019-04-13 12:03:11 I have something to clarify. I trade 99% futures. I am thinking about switching to stocks because of the momentum strength individually vs stock indexes and position sizing is smaller. which led me to say this..
853 2019-04-13 12:00:19 I saw your tweets about property investments and things amongst that, didn't see the ones bout stocks, my bad
854 2019-04-13 12:00:10 Abeg do u have a platform where one can short these stocks for a minimum of six month at a fee of course
855 2019-04-13 11:59:48 Haha sureeee Cus if no say I scared later I no keep track then goodbye stocks LOL
856 2019-04-13 11:59:19 Yea when those Norse guys were burning witches and putting people in the stocks for weeks caused they cussed, those were dark times. Damn those Norse pegans, oh wait!

860 2019-04-13 11:54:35 #GoodPoint. If one believes the #FeddleGummint is on the verge of bankruptcy with #CivilInsurrection ensuing, isn't the expectation of a DOW 10,000 with trading suspended indefinitely realistic? Why not get liquid (totally out of stocks with your skin) now? Invest in survival.
861 2019-04-13 11:53:59 Instead of Jewelries, gears and hoes try Real estate,stocks & bitcoins
862 2019-04-13 11:50:47  It’s a bit pricey, hope I can afford it or they have stocks when I’ll buy it as soon as I earned for that asdfghjkl

Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
864 2019-04-13 11:48:52 For me, no! This isn’t a leverage on stocks. It’s for another asset. I am a big believer of loans to buy cars, houses etc. specially when you have the Money and invest it. This ensures that your money will be more than your loan interest, hence the difference is your profit. (9%>
865 2019-04-13 11:48:05 So I just realised that $dis is up 12% on the disney+ annoucement! Can someone tell me how a #stocks can be valued 12% higher on an old news. I’m tired of this #stockmarket ! People don’t value companies for its actual earnings. We don’t even know if it will be profitable!
866 2019-04-13 11:47:30 STP tu peux m’expliquer ce que signifie « la récession attendue », moi qui croyait qu’elle est déjà bien installée, avec des stocks d’invendus impressionnants et dont l’externalité augmente le niveau des risques ?
867 2019-04-13 11:44:23 When it’s reached the stage where conflict is no longer mobile and static but static on static we have reached saturation point . The good market in the Far East for crab is going to take its toll on crab stocks pretty quickly and everyone is joining the party

872 2019-04-13 11:43:15 Luckily i sold all my stocks and built a bomb shelter at his urging when trump was elected.
That worked our well.
873 2019-04-13 11:42:38 Yes, but for stocks to rise you need flows buying them.  They don’t just magically rise, or maybe they do now 
874 2019-04-13 11:35:05 That extra management cost  the FMs charge for Credit Risk Funds, should be utilized for Fundmental Analysis/Bottom Up picking for Debt Securities too, just like Stocks. Rather than going by the Ratings. This is bound to happen as the Debt Markets get more vibrant.
875 2019-04-13 11:33:00 She was licked in the stocks and looking around hoping nobody would find her and let out a sigh "I guess I must have done something wrong again, oh well"

878 2019-04-13 11:29:47 If they raise rates = recession, stocks will fall, harder to service the debt interest 
if they keep rates down = inflation, stocks will rise, easier to service debt 
Better for them to keep rates low and score political points even though inflation will be a run away train.
879 2019-04-13 11:28:44 Bret... Try leaps.... I am trading like you as well.... But I use very long term calls and puts and when the price moves up, I make them a vertical spread. I trade about 15 stocks... Watch about 200. I have split my watch list to daily checks, wttkly checks etc.

909 2019-04-13 10:55:28 So shaan will explain to you a situation. I hv a stock portfolio of 100 rs. It has gone up  to rs 150. Thus to book profits I then decide to buy a house of 50 rs. I sell stocks worth rs 25  and take a loan of 25 rs. Is this loan as leverage on stocks  or not?

I have a lot of issues with LJH.. but as he has stocks in FNC, I don't think he would have stayed, causing also himself to lose money, if it wasn't the army...in the least, if he could he  would've probably declared hiatus.

933 2019-04-13 10:16:12 My guess would be much of this might be possible with some development but problem is the NRA and gun lobby in the states would block this from ever seeing the light of day.

936 2019-04-13 10:10:14 To a narcissist you were just a commodity, like stocks and shares. A possession to own. Until you tarnish and become wise you will be: used, polished, looked after. Once your usefullness fades you will be swapped for another, just like a new car.

939 2019-04-13 10:08:45 The challenge I guess as you said is the lack of belief amongst the investor community that there is a market for small cap African stocks. The community is very trade sale focused which places constraints on valuation. I don't see an easy way to change this.
940 2019-04-13 10:06:40 The ability to get healthcare and limited welfare services across 28 countries. Ability for nations to veto key changes. Common fisheries policy (being updated) to ensure British fishermen don’t nearly wipe out all the fish stocks in the North Sea, like they did in the 70’s

944 2019-04-13 10:03:43 Stocks are up also because the new tax law has given money to companies who are now buying back their own stock above real value.  A new bubble.  A new Republican-created problem and we’ll be left holding the bad.

954 2019-04-13 09:51:56 How much work have been completed?

They have only started on the KB to Gombak stretch worth about RM46B.
The tracks,systems and rolling stocks is 40% of the RM46B; according to MRL.

Thus..
C&S is   RM28B.
TCRS is RM18B

What is the progress of the C&S?
TCRS is of cos 0%
955 2019-04-13 09:49:54 I would gamble and get in Oshane Thomas....need to add to the bowling stocks, Stokes or Piggy, toss a coin...
956 2019-04-13 09:49:46 Prices have already gone up...I bought in Avocados stocks as soon as I heard of boarders with Mexico closing.!
957 2019-04-13 09:49:05 Thanks Rhom! End of ‘18 wasn’t the best for me. The recovery in the markets early ‘19 has assisted greatly. I’ve also enjoyed learning from the generous Twitter community too. Had a clear out at the turn of the year & then sat on my hands. I’m happier now holding these stocks! 
958 2019-04-13 09:48:45 I own buffetology and suspect yesterday’s move at GAW will move the fund up to mid table. The underperformance is explained in part by strength of technology and resource stocks over Q1. He is light on both sectors
959 2019-04-13 09:48:38 Many #fossil fuel companies will go #bankrupt as #climate suits and damages crumble their biz models. So #stockbrokers must be constrained to offering these stocks or bonds to only most risk capable investors. @environment @green4EMA @EnvironmentMA @UCSUSA @UNEnvironment
960 2019-04-13 09:46:16 Aw boohoo... people with investments can shift them to other dividend paying stocks. Bernie's plan provides for severance pay and reeducation of health insurance employees. As for the oligarchs who run them, they can KMA...
961 2019-04-13 09:45:14 pnf_6 : The box size should be decided by considering the instrument in question and deciding what price moves you wish to isolate. It could be different for index or FNO stocks.

968 2019-04-13 09:38:37 Stocks are ownership of a business. So a business that produces potatoes is like a box that contains all the equipment and relationships required to produce potato’s. By purchasing that box and selling it later you are transporting the whole box into the future.

1022 2019-04-13 08:35:20 This could be just a rebound due to companies repleting their stocks. But it is also possible that 1) external demand is strengthening 2) financial conditions have improved and uncertainty has fallen after the govt’s budget U-turn.

1044 2019-04-13 07:50:47 BETA= a stocks price and the whole markets movement are in a relationship. Beta measures that relationship. If stock J has a beta of 3.5, that means for every 1 point the whole market moves l, stock J moves 3.5 pts. Vice Versa.

1050 2019-04-13 07:38:19 Idea is to have SL for portfolio stocks as well. You don't sit there watch portfolio dropping 20%-40% etc.

For rest of us investment works best.

1170 2019-04-13 05:02:54 Agree. When we went from 2500 to 2900 blow off top in 2018 my Uber driver was talking about stocks and bitcoin. Now it’s not a single peep
1171 2019-04-13 05:02:23 Maybe this is what’s going to happen

Trade stocks like it was 1998

Trade bonds like it was 2007

Trade VIX like it was 2017

Welcome to the United Bubble States of America.
1172 2019-04-13 05:01:57 Learn how to trade stocks & you can make it in a week. #NoAd lol
1173 2019-04-13 05:01:30  me checking the stocks.
1174 2019-04-13 05:01:09 Hey, we are going to keep stocks high for our fans.
1175 2019-04-13 04:57:34 Everybody taking a victory lap for Jones after game one should be placed in the stocks. Fucking idiots.
1176 2019-04-13 04:57:17 Sana di maubos stocks Hahahahahahahah

See you!!
1177 2019-04-13 04:57:14 The key is to stick to the Successfull stocks rather than trying to understand complex stocks and sit tight.
1178 2019-04-13 04:55:05 And JLR data is nt gd.. I will better track other stocks with sales data on 1st of month then 4 times sirf data tracking..
1179 2019-04-13 04:54:58 You lost  get out of there man. Put that money in some weed stocks
1180 2019-04-13 04:54:14 Not so sure about FTSE100 as constituent stocks enjoy 60% dollar earnings, but investment in business and the U.K. in general should select another gear!
1181 2019-04-13 04:53:49 It’s called the same fraud that’s been going on for 11 yrs. stocks up while majority of ppl are dead broke. Makes sense. Fundamentals have been horrific. I don’t think anyone’s buying I just think they can hold stocks up digitally. Just like they can print money out of thin air
1182 2019-04-13 04:52:36 Invest in piss stocks they on the rise
1183 2019-04-13 04:52:31 There's a touch of general masochism in us all darling.  *stocks up on the usual...bourbon, whiskey, tequila* 
1184 2019-04-13 04:50:33 Yeah, but if I look at these 6 stocks in 5 years, who do you think will be ahead?
1185 2019-04-13 04:48:51 yall know that once BLACKPINK stopped performing the coachella stream views went down like if it was YG's stocks
1186 2019-04-13 04:46:14 Texas resident here. The only reason my taxes went down this year was because I didn’t sell any short term stocks (my mistake last year). However, what I did shell out seemed higher than two years ago.
1187 2019-04-13 04:45:21 Seeing things at NAB has me re-thinking the FAANG stocks as early innings. I know they are all enormous companies, but it is going to take tremendous scale to realize all of the possibilities of AI and machine learning. It is its own vast, untapped universe of ideas.
1188 2019-04-13 04:45:07 By 2 do you mean the financial information? We would have to find a data source that tracks the quarterly revenues and cost and may that over time to show a potential forecast of the BE for each stock. Stocks that BE and then make $ for the first time have a largest rerates.
1189 2019-04-13 04:43:54 Love you but don’t think that will play out. Crypto’s good and bad will rise and fall together in parallel for a long time to come. Not realistic to think things will just change with no real valuation metrics. These are not commodities, stocks, bonds or fiat
1190 2019-04-13 04:41:40 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
1191 2019-04-13 04:40:39 I've bought like $35 of the "penny stocks" that are supposed to do well this year, and ...we're just hanging out. lol
1192 2019-04-13 04:39:40 Please keep stocks and release this mobile on Amazon.
1193 2019-04-13 04:39:30 Hey, we are surely going to keep stocks high for our fans.

1196 2019-04-13 04:35:05 Any property, bank accounts, non profit accts. Stocks bonds basically everything they posses should be confiscated. Then thrown in prison for conspiracy, theft, fraud and given the Ricco act.
1197 2019-04-13 04:34:08 No doubt! A great day for Disney stocks.
When do you sell?
1198 2019-04-13 04:30:42 “It’s no surprise that private prison company stocks soared after Trump’s win.”
1199 2019-04-13 04:30:18 Can it be argued that the large construction houses like WBHO, Aveng, Murray & Roberts, Group Five, Basil Read, Raubex and Stefanutti Stocks are in a financial mess because of their cartel conduct? Is competition with black owned firms a factor?
1200 2019-04-13 04:29:59 Nah she only goes online to check her stocks and hit like on pictures of her great grandchildren.
1201 2019-04-13 04:26:38 LOL...that article is so skewed, it's hilarious.  Obama took over right when the market bottomed out. It had nowhere to go but up. Everyone (me included) lost a lot of value in our holdings. Fortunately, I was sitting on some cash in 2008, so I could buy up stocks really cheap.
1202 2019-04-13 04:23:41 In what regard??
I think that $XRP will dominate the regulated space and be a global means of value transfer for money, bonds, stocks, real estate etc. 
However, #Bitcoin will win out as the open, public, unregulated global blockchain and value transfer.
1203 2019-04-13 04:21:15 Well you don't *snort* it, its more like a sharp but gentle sniff. You only want it in your nostrils not the sinus or you will have Regrets. Thats the newbie mistake. It is rare here too, my local tobacco shop only stocks it because some octogenarians still use it.
1204 2019-04-13 04:20:49 Your stocks down, maybe you better worry about business
1205 2019-04-13 04:20:46 This is intraceuticals Mother’s Day gift pack. Hurry up! Limited stocks only!
1206 2019-04-13 04:20:21 Ummm...you do realize this article states what I've been saying.  If you invest your 401k in US stocks, then the Dow Jones (or other market indicators) is reflective of the gains you'll see in your 401k holdings.
1207 2019-04-13 04:19:07 Man!!! To be honest trading stocks is going soooo well, i really don't uber or lyft drive anymore
1208 2019-04-13 04:18:53 Hello Chingus! May mga gusto pa bang mag-avail ng ABV3 diyan? My supplier has a lot of stocks and has cheaper price! from 3150 I can give it to you by 2900 + lsf (25% off) please dm me it is under fast ETA. I will accept orders until April 17 so we can get slots already
1209 2019-04-13 04:18:00 The Dow is an indicator of major companies in the US stock market.  If you wisely invest your 401k to have a portion of your retirement savings in US stocks, like I have, then an increase in the Dow correlates to an increase in the value of my holdings in my 401k account.
1210 2019-04-13 04:17:23 That's why the first group are value stocks and the second group is not. You want to buy when Wall Street has fled.
1211 2019-04-13 04:16:33 Ang scam ni ate information dun sa smf sabi sarado na filbar so lumakbay ako sa ft tas pauwi andaming stocks ng pulp mag sa filbar?
1212 2019-04-13 04:14:35 Please make a guide video on your home page, or web app. Terminology is not clear. Borrowing the term "share" from stocks, imo, adds confusion. UX could use some more love to be more intuitive.  Happy to chat more if you would like more specific input
1213 2019-04-13 04:13:50 I don’t know. Supposedly it totally exonerates Trump but he’s hiding it. We all just have to take this pathological liar at his word. By the way, I know you fail miserably at trading stocks. I’m saying this as someone who caught NVIDIA early. You’re too stupid.
1214 2019-04-13 04:13:35 apple stocks rise by 35%.

Suck it up, even your time will come.

1218 2019-04-13 04:11:53 matagal pa ata sila magkaroon ng stocks eh. Ang layo ko sa Makati rin kaya PH GO na lang ako hahaha
1219 2019-04-13 04:10:56 Basically instead of wasting time on Twitter you all need to be investing in stocks. Buy low and sell high. That’s my secret trick.
1220 2019-04-13 04:10:47 Yeccch! Millennials Ate My Blue Chip Stocks !!
1221 2019-04-13 04:10:46 A million McMuffins should come with some McDonald’s stocks. This an investment I’m willing to go in on with you bro
1222 2019-04-13 04:10:04 You kind of had that backwards. Bernie was rightfully the candidate or did you forget? Even with being fed the debate questions, she fumbled. And she was too busy building a glass ceiling to bother to visit Wisconsin.

1227 2019-04-13 04:06:52 Google Adds DuckDuckGo As a company stocks….
1228 2019-04-13 04:05:39 I have always used $VIX as a sort of inverse indicator of market direction...  but the last couple days make no sense to me. The VIX stays down, but the 50 or so stocks I watch daily are all in the red as well, and rather flat. 
Is there a historical basis for VIX-dissociation?
1229 2019-04-13 04:05:22 Hey, we are going to keep our stocks high for our fans.
1230 2019-04-13 04:05:13 WRONG ... The very, very small start Trump made (very, very small) was banning bump stocks  but the very, very small start is better than the 4 previous presidents efforts --(which was NOTHING)

1245 2019-04-13 03:38:21 $nab.c with overall sector sh*t plus $CGC added to index but no follow-through on other stocks in the sector - tells you clearly the liquidity is gone and no one's buying. pump and dumps don't work when overall sector is bearish - especially when the company has literally nothing
1246 2019-04-13 03:38:18 Really? Thank God  i hope next comeback people will buy at Tower Records, i hope they have good stocks

1247 2019-04-13 03:37:08 $nab.c easily logic here. there is a group paid 500k to pump this - you assess the overall momentum and ride the horse. stocks are all horses we ride  for the gains - even though you know it's a pump and dump, just ride the imminent wave - but asesss if there IS wave.
1248 2019-04-13 03:33:03 US Dollar Sidelined as Surging Stocks See AUDJPY, EURJPY Breakout: Many significant concerns are being resolved or kicked down the road, giving investors enough of reason to increase their appetite for risk.

1250 2019-04-13 03:28:37 I have money in stocks. I just also have a savings account.

1252 2019-04-13 03:27:41 The biggest setback to electric vehicles in Australia is that we have a huge amount of lithium but all the lithium stocks are being manipulated down in price so that the Chinese can take them over.  It’s very clear.
1253 2019-04-13 03:24:55 Stop tweeting about stocks I'm not invested in.

1259 2019-04-13 03:20:29 The last BSE lecture shook me up. Still feeling...And looking at all stocks with anew.
1260 2019-04-13 03:17:59 Nassim Taleb. Nice choice. :-)

I don't think you're Chicken Little and I selfishly hope that stocks do drop through the floor because I can make a shit load of money (for myself and for my clients) that way.

1263 2019-04-13 03:15:46 When I was a little boy my grandfather gave me a plastic orange juice jug and every day I made money trading stocks I would put a coin in the jug.  Once full, he told me to use the jug coins to buy myself an ice cream treat and enjoy a nice dinner.

1273 2019-04-13 03:09:41 Another source I have never heard of.  You are the one that insisted on using known sources. So, practice what you preach. The reason those stocks tumbles was because thousand of Netflix customers cancelled their Netflix subscriptions practically overnight when they found out

1275 2019-04-13 03:08:22 I don't see a conflict. I am just making people aware that at much cheaper prices, consultants were given options as payment in exchange for something. Perfectly legal and happens all the time. You should always know where cheap paper is in stocks you trade IMO.

1282 2019-04-13 02:53:27 At least you know they still down, % only a handful of stocks regain from the correction, since the pump was direct to few companies,
1283 2019-04-13 02:51:33 2/2 Instead of it being parceled out into 3 different programs.  I don't miss the VCP.  I make about $300 more a month, than I was under the old compensation package.  The free stocks were nice (I have 3,) but I like the idea of money now...not a couple years down the road.
1284 2019-04-13 02:48:21 I'm in the 'really cool' camp. Some of the parallel scenes I've seen have made me appreciate Star Wars in a new light. And strictly speaking, what isn't stolen in Star Wars? It's basically repurposed western stocks and Arthurian lore and characters reskinned as a space story. ;)
1285 2019-04-13 02:45:06 I recently started investing into stocks and can I say I never thought I’d be doing this shit at the age of 20.

1290 2019-04-13 02:38:18 Talking with my parents about investing in stocks:

Stepdad: i invested in this cannabis stock a few months ago 

Mom: how do you do that, i want to invest!

Me: you wanna buy cannabis? I know a guy
1291 2019-04-13 02:37:34 Researching the hell out of stocks is the reason I don’t drink or go out much anymore hah Beating on my craft I guess
1292 2019-04-13 02:34:02 Where can I find the momentum stocks, Matt? My teams need more momentum. 
1293 2019-04-13 02:32:42 Then I'm gonna buy this ship stocks.
1294 2019-04-13 02:29:59 Cause you never used to care about pot stocks ?
1295 2019-04-13 02:29:14 Getting into stocks is the most unexpected thing to happen to me this year so far
1296 2019-04-13 02:29:08 I agree. President Trump has multiple strings of income (stocks, bonds, equities and more) that will require lots of people to go through it properly, and maybe double checking it too.
1297 2019-04-13 02:23:46 You are obviously on the payroll. NAB please get this person for laundering 55  Billion dollars of Sharifs' loot through investment in Cannabis stocks!
1298 2019-04-13 02:22:52 And who was it that took your bump stocks? Oh yeah, the @GOP
1299 2019-04-13 02:21:57 Hi Jim...Thanks for highlighting that you want to see revenue growth instead of endless buybacks from bank stocks.
1300 2019-04-13 02:20:49 How do you figure she was robbed? She was the criminal force who rigged the primaries against Bernie, and knew Obama spied on the Trump campaign! Don’t believe the liberal talking points of dishonesty and divide. Our economy is strong and our enemies weakened! Trump 2020!

1305 2019-04-13 02:15:56 There's a bunch of science that indicates the diverse teams make better decisions, and work more creatively. Outside of office work they are also better at picking stocks and better at deliberating on juries. Harvard Business Review is a good place to start if you need cites.
1306 2019-04-13 02:15:40 From now on out, all my close friends getting stocks for their birthdays. PERIODT!
1307 2019-04-13 02:13:43 VoQ radio reported: #Ethiopia government forces including ENDF regional OPDO leaders burned down 11 houses of poor farmers with belongings inside (stocks of food, beds, cash, and other personal property worth $300,000) have been destroyed, per a victim  source from Guji. #Oromia

1309 2019-04-13 02:12:26 Lower low is bearish for EM innovation stocks says Gartman.
1310 2019-04-13 02:11:50 Luke Walton deserved a better opportunity, but to be expected after Magic just was like, “uh yeah this GM life ain’t cut out for me... I’m good ” Who would have thought the @Knicks and the @Lakers would be the laughing stocks of the @NBA ?!?! For real.
1311 2019-04-13 02:04:39 An example here, at the time of 90's when most people used to invest in regular Stocks and debts, in return, they get nominal return, but investing in long-term stocks of like Infosys or Tata will produce huge return.
Investment of 10,000 of that time may become 500 Crores...
1312 2019-04-13 02:04:07 Your money should be in stocks. You’re too young for a savings account.
1313 2019-04-13 02:00:07 Don’t talk stocks!!
1314 2019-04-13 01:59:15 bro i wish it was also that easy for my country to hav a retail store with kpop shit stocks :(
1315 2019-04-13 01:58:46 @EconguyRosie Mr. Rosenberg, Guggenheim just predicted a mild recession and a severe Bear Market for stocks (40 to 50% loss).  My "gut" has told me for some time that this is coming.   Do you think this will happen soon, this year?  Thank you, John F. Manning, Brooklyn, NY.

1318 2019-04-13 01:56:35 I never said the April 14th due date was when I would see it.  I said it was due then and Trump will state his implementation plan by May 10th.  I hold those positions today.  Now seeing how the stocks had a poor week can this mean the 232 is a NO?  Is Katusa right?  I say no.
1319 2019-04-13 01:56:13 Listen. I wanna date a nigga with stocks and bonds. I’ve been investing for 5 years now and you cant match my dividend I don’t want you 
1320 2019-04-13 01:54:59 We did this in the 80s in the Philippines. There was a call for civil disobedience mainly to boycott companies owned by Marcos cronies. Stocks of these companies slumped shortly.

1322 2019-04-13 01:54:03 2019 is beyond understanding. In 00 or 08 there was some basis to make for continuation. Both became event driven recessions on a tech/housing bust. 2019 is global now & no country has the tools to address it. Epic measures to keep life support going is failing yet stocks soar

1324 2019-04-13 01:52:20 There's no viable comparison to 2002-2003. Gold and gold stocks were already making 52-week highs before then. Gold vs. S&P was trending higher for a long time at that point. Fed was slashing rates, real rates were declining, etc.
1325 2019-04-13 01:51:30 About"The slaughter of baby seals":
One of the main reasons that our cod stocks have 'tanked', is became they are being eaten by Seals.
When Bridget Bardeau had her Big 'Anti-seal', campaign, the increase of seals wiped out the cod.
MANY Newfoundland fishermen lost their jobs.
1326 2019-04-13 01:49:00 This is true. Fast food stocks are overlooked. Dominoes is another.
1327 2019-04-13 01:48:27 Real estate... stocks.. bonds... savings... residual income... multiple incomes!! Entrepreneurship... Imma always be on this hype.. YouTube n twitch is what I chose to do not what I have to do don’t get it FU!!
1328 2019-04-13 01:47:35 I can't wait to dump my money into a company that may never be profitable... you gotta be a real fool. #investing #stocks #IPO #Uber
1329 2019-04-13 01:46:25 I mean same tbh. It can either be I hit them at 30 and combo them to death, or take a straight up early stock like med shoryu at 50. As jank as luigi cyclone was in 4, I can't say it didn't feel a bit good to take stocks at 0 
1330 2019-04-13 01:46:08 That ETF is actually 150% long cyclicals and 50% short defensive stocks so it's not 15% outperformance in the traditional sense. The actual difference is probably less than half that number.
1331 2019-04-13 01:44:40 COLONIAL CORPORATION stocks rallying

1334 2019-04-13 01:40:07 @JBoorman for trend following on stocks, what is your policy on holding through earnings?
1335 2019-04-13 01:39:04 Yes, you can say that about any small market--precious metals mining, penny stocks, etc. Small size doesn't mean money will reliably come in, particularly if most of the assets in the market are worthless. Our fundamental views on cryptos like $BTC are different.
1336 2019-04-13 01:38:46 Quinnipiac University takes it over Canisius University with two 4 stocks. Next match vs RPI (A) in the Final Four
1337 2019-04-13 01:37:20 You’re right! I wasn’t even thinking of stocks 
1338 2019-04-13 01:35:46 Sitting up drinking talking bout stocks with my lil brother wouldn’t be anywhere else in the world
1339 2019-04-13 01:33:42 2019 resolution was to stop trying to time the market and commit to investing in 1 company with realistic 1 year growth opportunity, each month, with goal of ending the year with a diverse little portfolio of stocks I like long term. Disney was my March pick.
1340 2019-04-13 01:33:21 I'm going into the Stocks business RS.
1341 2019-04-13 01:32:54 I haven’t started to sell put pero paubos na stocks due to advance reservations, thank you so so much you guys! 
1342 2019-04-13 01:32:29 Trump decided we don’t “need” bump stocks. So he imposed a ban and confiscation against all Americans. Despicable! Can someone remind me again what that other scumbag Obama confiscated from us?

1346 2019-04-13 01:25:33 I need to invest in the stocks that @BarackObama & @HillaryClinton did
1347 2019-04-13 01:25:04 You're better off betting on penny stocks, or even horse racing.  Bigger upside. Review in any sport in my opinion is a time waster.  Unless it's to check if a ball stayed fair, or a puck or football crossed a goal line, it's garbage to me.
1348 2019-04-13 01:23:37 Hi!!! I bought it at Astro Market Place PH on facebook (you can search for Airah Untalan's post). I'm not sure if there are stocks left but you might want to check it out :)

1352 2019-04-13 01:20:32 Speculation- “investment in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss”
1353 2019-04-13 01:19:58 Top stocks right now
1354 2019-04-13 01:19:23 You should drop the Obama care stocks.
1355 2019-04-13 01:14:24 So who do you think will run and win? Biden Bernie? Lol. Kamala beto? How about Michelle O Kamala? Maybe we can have Shultz and Bloomberg!! Ha...trump is most definitely going to win. Especially since GS just stated no resession until after 2020 with how stocks look.
1356 2019-04-13 01:14:04 Never admitted they "earned little".

Stocks can rise even if the company isn't as profitablenas perceived due to corporate malfeasance or other external factors.
1357 2019-04-13 01:13:52 That was my point niggas don’t really like or care for the shit they are buying they buying it for other people. My tweet was about rather you have the money or not. It was about buying shit that gains value overtime. Like land, stocks or real estate
1358 2019-04-13 01:13:05 It has been in the Top 3 shorted stocks for the past 4-5 months whilst evaluating bidders for SDV...I thought bidders would cause alarm amongst shorters...why not?
1359 2019-04-13 01:11:56 I’m thinking about buying Disney stocks since this new streaming is coming out 
1360 2019-04-13 01:06:53 Sell the house, sell the cars, sell the stocks, liquidate the assets, sell the yeezys

And put it ALL

On Tampa winning this series
1361 2019-04-13 01:05:20 LOL, at least I made enough money from my weed stocks to buy another gun 
1362 2019-04-13 01:01:59 Oh so you want the truth then? Bear with the suit actually invested all of his osap money in DOW and weed stocks. That’s why he’s so successful and has enough brainpower/IQ to maintain his stocks and master the intricate, complex game of Dota at the same time.
1363 2019-04-13 01:01:22 The same thing.... all that matters is to take time and do something very productive....
I’d probably get myself a huge percentage  of stocks in a company who’s public.
1364 2019-04-13 01:00:34 Uyoooo main stocks ke skrg bossqurrrrrrzz
1365 2019-04-13 01:00:31 Twitter is a good for sharing ideas, research, putting ideas out on stocks.  It can also anchor you to ideas and marry you to them.  $INS $HYRE $STNE $CWBHF etc etc all are good ideas at the right price.  I like researching them and sharing but I am ok with being wrong on them.

1368 2019-04-13 00:55:00 I only hold a handful of stuff (4-5 positions max ex-cash), so for me mistakes hurt more.  Cutting losses quickly is pretty important.  If you're holding 20 positions then its a different story.  Important to know what works best for you.

1370 2019-04-13 00:52:37 Important to assess your own mental makeup with investing and be mentally flexible.  Psychology of investing is more important than anything else imo.  For me, if a position goes against me a certain percentage, I'm out.  There's 7,000+ stocks.  Move on to the next one.

1371 2019-04-13 00:52:08 Atleast in stocks there is some underlying asset..an authority which takes care if some mess up happens..
You know better than bitcoin has no underlying asset & so many people have been victim of theft yet unresolved issues
1372 2019-04-13 00:48:31 Maybe on dividend paying stocks you could do this, but again the ramifications are not surface level, so any legislation would have to be well thought out and lobby friendly. I'm sure we have different philosophies, which is fine, but I'm more concerned about spending, not taxes.

1381 2019-04-13 00:34:05 Wholly incorrect.  Automatic weapons can suffer from recoil management if not propely designed or used.  Bump stocks are not precision tools.  By their very nature they can not be.  Same with "bump firing".
1382 2019-04-13 00:32:27 Poof! AR's in NZ will be underground just like the bump stocks are now here. Not that anyone will do that..

1407 2019-04-13 00:01:04 Yacktman has done a great job of talking about valuing stocks like bonds. If there is no volatility to cash flows, then a stock is just a bond with a positive growth rate instead of the 0% growth you get with bonds.

1422 2019-04-12 23:48:25 Let's be real.  Twitter was going bankrupt and stocks was crashing until Trump joined Twitter. For that reason alone, Twitter will continue to allow Trump to incite hate and white supremacist propaganda.

1433 2019-04-12 23:56:25 Thank you, this is the info I was looking for!!!

1435 2019-04-12 23:53:25 Honestly if u don’t know how to buy stocks i just assume you’re a guy who never gave it a chance because you’re too cool and hate on it because u feel like it makes u cool to dislike something popular........

1439 2019-04-12 23:48:25 Let's be real.  Twitter was going bankrupt and stocks was crashing until Trump joined Twitter. For that reason alone, Twitter will continue to allow Trump to incite hate and white supremacist propaganda.

1447 2019-04-12 23:36:31 Remember those Democrat Mayors who thought the rioters needed to be allowed to loot.  You almost sound like them.  What we really need is to put these crooks in stocks or chains in the public square for a wee bit.
1448 2019-04-12 23:35:06 30 years ago the S&P 500 index “cost” 1% of median household income. Today it “costs” 5%. Would any of you say that the cost of investing in stocks has eaten up gains elsewhere?

1456 2019-04-12 23:28:29 When the money they use to buyback stocks is taxed but money invested in the company is not the financial incentive is to keep it on the company. How do I know this? It happened during the 50s, 60s, and 70s.
1457 2019-04-12 23:28:05 Depends on how liquid the options the are, if I’m trading high volume stocks like Apple or Bank of America,the volume is high so the spreads are much tighter and it’s not worth it,but for more obscure stocks with options on them like VMware for example,then the spreads are bigger

1494 2019-04-12 22:48:13 Not true because all retirement accounts of any type including pension plans are invested in stocks so most Americans have a vested interest directly or indirectly in the stock market.

1503 2019-04-12 22:42:42 Trump has done more for this country than Obama ever did.  The only reason some people think things are bad is Democrats and news press.  look at jobs, stocks and how companies are expanding.  All Democrats want to do is give money away, they don’t respect our laws.

1523 2019-04-12 22:29:31 Great stocks will go through pullback periods (sometimes unreasonable), they will also fly high for no apparent- especially in a volatile market. Timing a perfect entry proves to be difficult. With time & propoer due diligence comes the reward. Not losing sleep over $NRTH

1558 2019-04-12 21:55:42 Did you add everything?! That's what it sounds like. You got investments and stocks?
1559 2019-04-12 21:54:31 @Chrom_SSBU doesn't have to get very close to his opponent, so @Boy_The_Roy couldn't get many good hits on Chrom. Roy got spiked all three stocks, and Chrom took the game.
1560 2019-04-12 21:53:42 @money2themasses Some Cash ISA providers are "Portfolio" providers where you can subscribe to multiple cash ISAs provided they are from the same provider i.e. Nationwide. Are you aware if there are any stocks and shares ISA providers that offer similar?
1561 2019-04-12 21:52:53 I disagree Daniel,  why would you allow people pumping the stocks to trap moms and dads in the first place?  Short term or long term it is fraudulent activities. 
They often moderate posts that provide true facts.

1563 2019-04-12 21:51:04 Republican senate chair Burr said adequate basis for that warrant.  Far, far more reliable than an idiot rep. who sues cows! Seriously, think it contains intelligence from allies.  But, if release, Nunes has to agree to spend a week in stocks for lying.  I trust Burr.

1572 2019-04-12 21:43:12 I use to view you as an officer and a gentleman, a hero on the side of the angels, but all the qualities are being squandered and your stocks of goodness wasted when you care more to the wall than human misery, and partake in questioning fellow citizen loyalty. Avoid foxnews.
1573 2019-04-12 21:41:24 Have you thought about different paper stocks?
1574 2019-04-12 21:40:08 Not the same perhaps but what else are stocks valued in when buying and selling them?
1575 2019-04-12 21:40:02 I heard that stocks would come under pressure during the buyback blackout period. I heard that bank earnings would be horrible. I’ve been promised that growth is slowing. I’ve been told this is a bear-market rally. How do I mute and forget all that bullshit?
1576 2019-04-12 21:39:46 I hate Smash Ultimate's online. I have my preferred ruled to 3 stocks 7 mins, but I get into matches with 2 stocks 3 mins and I'll be winning at 0% and they're at 120% and they just start camping till the time runs out and it goes to sudden death and i loose it's annoying.
1577 2019-04-12 21:38:57 At issue is the fact that regular market auto depreciation is not this fast. The market did not change the value of the car. Tesla did. Tesla pushed the market price way way down far faster than is typical. Cars and stocks are not at all analogous. Finance 101 here.
1578 2019-04-12 21:37:34 I like boycotts. I think you should speak with your wallets/pocketbooks. I also like liquidating stocks or at a minimum organizing share voting blocks to send a message. I have issues with those who say, "if you boycott 'them', that will hurt 'us'"...

1582 2019-04-12 21:34:11 It’s pretty awful. For me it correlates with the the entry of the nasdaq. Stocks are a rich person’s gamble and they are all addicted. And now we are beholden to the greed of growth. Growth = higher stock prices = more wealth.

1670 2019-04-12 20:45:05 Actually I am very surprised that you act like you did. You see a fast moving stock which goes up 100% with a float of 0.6% of all outstanding shares. If dilution hits it can easily fall 20 or 30%. Others stocks can too but here you have the catalyst in your face.

1675 2019-04-12 20:41:55 So in our top 8 with UL’s smash team for the WiFi league we’re in, we have to do a best of 3 crew battles.

Set 1, a team of Ganon, Roy, and Dedede: I 9 stock them 

Set 2, counter picks of Lucas, Kirby, and Roy: I take 8 stocks and combo cleans up

WE IN TOP 4 NOW  LETS GO
1676 2019-04-12 20:41:53 Also, isn't this just a form of helicopter money? If we knew the ECB were to buy stocks, then we would all just have to front-run them.
1677 2019-04-12 20:41:41 The idea to enter small on high octane stocks is a flawed approach. But your experience might be different. For me float is a risk, period. And I have my safety net for a reason. And it is additive and a small position size doesn't compensate a low float.
1678 2019-04-12 20:41:04 kill em with kindness. idk why people have such a hard time believe people make money trading stocks but from passion alone, i see you're not just scamming shit poster. you have valuable content. thanks

1684 2019-04-12 20:37:56 $vix touched the LBB ..so we bought some qqq puts and cut lot of stocks ..that doesnt mean we arent long ..but we will sell more if we go up on monday ..
1685 2019-04-12 20:36:50 I don’t think a lot will buy here more BTC.. institutional money is not here yet.. institutional money btw is also NOT invested in penny stocks AND BTC is looked at as a penny stock from a market cap point of view because BTC IS is looked at as an asset class..
1686 2019-04-12 20:36:22  Diversification or tiny positions in stocks to 'manage' risk never worked for me. Risk is managed via logical stops and price targets. My attention is a limited and valuable resource. I pick my trades and then commit my full attention and spare 3% for you guys. #wisdom

1693 2019-04-12 20:31:13 The so called 'smart money' can act dumb at times by dumping stocks when they should have been buying them. 

That's where retail investors can have an edge over those funds as they aren't accountable for their immediate gratification focused big money  clients.

1742 2019-04-12 20:02:03 and stock buybacks also permitted money to be "borrowed" from overseas to repurchase stocks and borrowed money avoided the tax completely. It is just one of a myriad of loopholes large enough for Mac trucks. The point is that advantages go only to the large scale players.

These opportunities will be at the expense of those who are not positioned correctly.

1795 2019-04-12 19:23:04 CB’s have forced massive allocations from retirees and pensions into the stock market. 

Creating a self fulfilling loop where if anything threatens the stock market, it’s that much more important for the Fed to save it.

1801 2019-04-12 19:20:00 I'd hold onto $msft until end of year. Getting in and out with $2 $3 up is so boring. Not enough meat. Stocks are like flowers gotta hold longer for maturity.
1802 2019-04-12 19:18:21 In that case, Why didn’t the Fed respond to a massive tax cut 
that created massive liquidity?  

A: The Fed is only “responsive” to falling stocks.

The rest is just theater for the uneducated.

1808 2019-04-12 19:14:43 nothing is guaranteed with the stock market. but only buying 4-5 stocks you wont get a meaningful return imo. at that quantity if you only buy 5 shares and it goes up $10 you only made $50 lol

Having fun with these penny stocks though. 0.06 to 0.065 on one of them and I'm up 10% 
1817 2019-04-12 19:07:46 How am I so unlucky as to have one of my stocks go up like 10% but another goes down the same amount, so everyone on that good stock is livin they rich lives while I'm whole stagnant
1818 2019-04-12 19:07:42 I want to invest in a few Stocks 
1819 2019-04-12 19:07:37 Is it right to consider healthcare, education, and housing as costs? To some extent they’re investments, no? Stocks were quite cheaper 30 years ago as well. In 1989 the “cost” of the S&P500 was 1% of median household income. Today it is 5%. Is that also a sign of stagnation?
1820 2019-04-12 19:07:30 Meritocracy at work! This gal was born in penury, worked her way up against all the odds, a self-educated champion of the dispossessed!

1865 2019-04-12 18:45:29 I’m wondering what effect a need to sell stock to pay property taxes would have on financial analysts who have various buy/sell restrictions throughout the year. Would certain stocks never be recommended by some companies just to make life easier? Might not matter.

1871 2019-04-12 18:42:42 Your economic policies are going to cause one of the worse depressions..... companies are taking the taxes you gave them to buy back their own stocks.   Rising stock prices are as fake as you are as a leader. You have been a good puppet for the Oil Families.

1896 2019-04-12 18:32:15 Almost certainly not. Most (all?) roboadvisors split your investment across ~half a dozen ETFs, which in turn own the largest stocks by market cap (S&P 500, etc).

1936 2019-04-12 18:12:54 Yeah, I don't necessarily abhor that approach - tho I caution that "growing broke" is a very real risk that I've seen land in Ch 11 countless times. Growth def drives short term investment & even growth stocks have crushed "value" for a decade now.  (1/

1957 2019-04-12 18:04:22 I watch from the sidelines. Vol was so light by the time volume met my criteria and pop on my scanners they ran too far.

I think alot of the traders where trading those stocks under $1 that were leading gappers this morning , hence the light volume
1958 2019-04-12 18:04:18 Amazon has lots of revenue streams. I just don't get why it's ok for a CEO to make obscene salaries, stocks & benefit pkgs compared to their employees; but refuse to fairly share any of the millions that workforce made possible.

1970 2019-04-12 17:59:08 Can you make stocks in your game
1971 2019-04-12 17:58:27 Yup, "people with property and stocks" will spend more. Screw everyone else. Misguided at best, criminal at worst.
1972 2019-04-12 17:57:22 I don't understand why people are struggling with this idea. Imagine it's not a famous athlete but your racist grandmother. Do you dust off the stocks for public shaming or seek to educate them? Attack is rarely productive in this context.
1973 2019-04-12 17:56:32 How about those bump stocks though?

1975 2019-04-12 17:55:36 Just when you think logic has returned, June bonds dump, testing 147'00 support.  Is it because stocks are rallying, or Europeans are buying?  The FED said they aren't raising rates for a YEAR.  Inflation is in check.  So, who's playing around in the U.S. bond market?  Is it YOU?
1976 2019-04-12 17:54:58 This was meant as a joke. However, if you’re trading stocks, you would’ve profited by longing every China trade talk headline/rumor.

2005 2019-04-12 17:34:12 Retail is guys like you and me. In the long run, the only way retail makes money in stocks is when institutions continue buying the names that we are long on. Price breakout on strong volume is a clue that institutions are behind the move (like the move in $DIS today).

2053 2019-04-12 17:06:34 The S&P 500 crossed the 2,900 mark for the first time since early October on Friday, boosted by a jump in #WaltDisney (NYSE:DIS) shares and as bank stocks surged after strong results from #JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)
2054 2019-04-12 17:06:07 I was an @NRA member, but when they didn’t say anything about bump stocks or red flag laws, I left and joined GOA. No use joining an organization if they won’t actually fight for your rights when the time comes. @GunOwners will actually put your money to use.
2055 2019-04-12 17:05:42 What stocks are y’all invested in
2056 2019-04-12 17:05:07 As stocks extend their spectacular first quarter run into Q2, the Christmas Eve rout appears to be long forgotten. Clearly, risk-on is back, at least for a while.
2057 2019-04-12 17:05:06 Would you mind also (shortly?) covering the stock market? SPY or even some of the regular stocks? Would love to hear your opinion on those as i have the feeling some big moves will come soon!

2060 2019-04-12 17:03:36 Thx for the update Jim.  Regarding stocks (SPX) I'm confused...I thought SPX was overbought and due for selloff, but it just keeps charging higher. So just keep buying with new money or wait for the pullback?

Many talk about the eventual plateau in the growth path of stocks that are scorching the charts! 

My simple point - many of these will last for 20 years or more! 

ENOUGH money to last a generation!

2092 2019-04-12 16:52:42 I assume that $800,000 invested conservatively in various instruments including stocks could provide at least $20-$30K/year. That plus some under-table income from odd-jobs is all I would need to live. I've thought this through.
2093 2019-04-12 16:52:14 People like too much to rush over new things. Jumia stocks start this morning at 14.5$. Now you can only buy it at 22.81.

2115 2019-04-12 16:42:38 It's easy to create charts of stocks breaking out, that are already up huge percentages. It's another to see subtle signals that can help you to get in earlier, before the breakout.

2117 2019-04-12 16:41:51 Finally Managed Care stocks are underperforming just like their services are.
2118 2019-04-12 16:41:21 True - I was bearish bonds into that move.  But stocks are pretty much overpriced 99% of the time so while bond market might be off, stock market is always off.  You had a decent price for 5 min in December.  Now at guaranteed loss price levels.
2119 2019-04-12 16:40:42 Quite right. Personally I’d bring back the stocks for people like her.

2135 2019-04-12 16:29:41 neiderhoffer wrote a whole book about this by the way. Buybacks are a side effect of why stocks rise in general. Entrepreneurs demand payment for their worth. Buybacks fit in that category. Take them away and they’d figure out something else.
2136 2019-04-12 16:29:38 Oh so we're back to  comparing stocks and flows ? No they did not "lend" it. But they don't need to for the loan to be serviceable. Also, we can play this game with any other firm. Not necessarily a bank. GM sells you a car for x. Its profit is p = x -a where a is production cost

2194 2019-04-12 16:11:36 Yes that’s a winning formula .  It’s finding those stocks that’s the skill 
2195 2019-04-12 16:11:28 Certainly not.  The tax cuts went to asset inflation, causing stocks to be over valued.  MFA would take money from useless insurance company paper shuffling and claim avoidance, and spend it on the public health, strengthening the work force and employing workers.

2231 2019-04-12 16:00:13 Generally, it's paper stock. Color needs a polished paper that lets the ink remain "on the surface" and those paper stocks are heavier. Notice books with color printed on less polished stock and the ink absorbs and the color quality is less pleasing - I think.

2239 2019-04-12 15:57:07 Because often these paid trading services pump stocks so they can sell their own bagholdings to clients.

2240 2019-04-12 15:56:45 Nobody is swimming in a pool of gold coins like Scrooge McDuck. That money is in the economy.

2251 2019-04-12 15:55:41 So now we have a gap. Stocks wanted to discount slower growth what is normal, so we have slower growth still but expectations like double earnings during a quarter pr two. Everything went as it should till December. Everything from that moment is upside down.
2252 2019-04-12 15:54:41 Stocks Rising 
2253 2019-04-12 15:54:17 Both their stocks are up today after solid earnings!  HB!!
2254 2019-04-12 15:54:09 Nigerian Banking stocks are ripe for a nice buy. Fidelity, UBA and access I recommend.
2255 2019-04-12 15:53:57 $SPY Often traders get excited about buying stocks AFTER they've already gone up considerably higher.  It's natural but it's also high risk.
2256 2019-04-12 15:53:52 Hmmm, looking at the statement again, we can say the future expectations were inferred from current facts (Earnings,Cashflow,growth etc). We can then re-modify that quote to "stocks are bought on expectations estimated from current facts" 

I guess that's more like it?

2311 2019-04-12 15:32:53 The flippers are trying to keep it down.  I feel we end up above .20 today.  They are running out of shares to dump.

2312 2019-04-12 15:32:19 The big question is there real revenue to back up that evaluation or is it just hope, excitement and duck tape holding it together.

Look what is happening to the Cannabis stocks in Canada. They are now so over valuated based upon their inability to meet real revenue projections

2318 2019-04-12 15:29:32 I don’t disagree with you guys, but you guys aren’t the incremental buyers, and we have different incentives, I’m paid to pick stocks that will beat other stocks over some much shorter time periods!
2319 2019-04-12 15:29:03 If $GH attacks fresh highs soon it is clearly the best trade of my 11 year career. Riding up the full 145% move, selling most on the 100$ century mark rejection and readding on the 50d MA bounce is spooky timing. 51% skill and 49% luck  #stocks
2320 2019-04-12 15:29:02 I just checked my stocks this morning to see that Disney+ has increased my marginal profit higher than I've ever seen it. I am a very happy man
2321 2019-04-12 15:28:45 Also, they hit $300 before Canadian legalization, when pot stocks were nothing but hype. Now that the news and reality has hit it’s very unlikely that you’re going to see crazy rallies like $TLRY experienced in September.
2322 2019-04-12 15:28:26 And that video says lyft stocks went down. 
2323 2019-04-12 15:28:22 Good article. My take is the 3-fund portfolios should work well for accumulation. For those in distribution and to prepare for rough markets, I'd prefer more levers to potentially pull. Even in Oct. '08 a few stocks went up, which I was able to sell for profitable distributions
2324 2019-04-12 15:28:15 Actually FB is not bigger than Twitter & has actually lost many users and various supporters because of some serious issues especially when it comes to fake news, fake accounts, being a platform for person(s) & organizations to spew hatred and fake news etc. Stocks have dropped.
2325 2019-04-12 15:28:00 This's exit rally wid Bonds in Risk off.

Keep away till price to book reaches 0.10-0.30... may be till Q1 2020.

For trading, PSU, Metals and Reality stocks r ok.
2326 2019-04-12 15:27:36 No major fall just a general grind down of my positions in the us, models are off in this environment . Only big fall is #huya on secondary, -10 wtd. Rest is -6 to +4 but red mostly. Can't even hit stops there stocks are just not following through.
2327 2019-04-12 15:27:07 Non dsl, le french monster a acheté tout le stock en 2017, l'ingrédient secret l'aide à mieux jouer. Il a la mâchoire en vrac quand il en boit et tire la langue. Les gens de Facebook le détestent pour avoir épuisé mes stocks, Twitter n'était pas encore au courant Kappa

I don't understand how come an almost bankrupt airline is still trading at Rs 260 when there are better stocks available at a much cheaper price.
2334 2019-04-12 15:24:39 Who cares? Stocks do not reflect companies but central banks policy.
2335 2019-04-12 15:23:53 Options are for mostly sophisticated investors who want to speculate on the movement of particular stocks and hedge against the risks of their current position. DO NOT trade options if you are new to investing.

2342 2019-04-12 15:21:08 You admitted to have no experience with bump stocks and I answered all of your questions as honestly as I couldn’t. When you don’t believe me, there’s not much else I can do, hence “agree to disagree”.

2344 2019-04-12 15:21:04 Does anyone use that Football Index app to buy/sell players like stocks? Haven’t had a proper look into it, but like the idea of it.

2346 2019-04-12 15:19:30 So based on the Mar 15 - Apr 15 pullback, is the theory that these (pot stocks) will pull up some over the summer months or continue to lag?

2355 2019-04-12 15:14:38 Don’t agree with one particular point: DI and management should buy stocks. The company has been raising/taking from shareholders while most management team has been selling. They need to show vested interest and put money where mouth is , instead of asking for shareholder money

China's CSI opened and closed lower to end the week, down 0.22% Friday due to a pullback in consumer stocks.

2386 2019-04-12 15:00:34 I'm sure it is, but tech-like stocks don't seem to trade at reasonable valuations. I think the market is pricing it on its future potential much like Amazon.

2432 2019-04-12 14:44:46 Republicans have no shame. IMHO this letter to CEOs is unethical and smacks of pay to play. We need to see their tax returns. I bet their stocks are heavily weighted in the drug industry.

2438 2019-04-12 14:43:18 I would not be against Cardiff Blues signing David Bulbring at all, would add good depth to our second row stocks.

2440 2019-04-12 14:42:33 The graph is trying to show how much some stocks would have to rally by to get back to where they were trading when oil last traded at $65. It is only one point in time but trying to use one of many approaches to exhibit the 2019 dislocation b/w oil price and oil stocks

2497 2019-04-12 14:23:17 Bump stocks attach to the stock of a semi-automatic rifle that allow the shooter to simulate a rate close to a fully-automatic weapon.

2498 2019-04-12 14:22:44 I'm seriously considering the idea equities will never fall again.

2506 2019-04-12 14:18:10 SnP still looks pretty good to me. Slow, but pushing every higher. 
The yield curve inverted for a short while, signalling poss recession, but it usually takes a long time and before the last three recessions stocks rallied a lot between inversion and the recession/mkt peak.
2507 2019-04-12 14:17:24 China is already below its long-term S/U ratio average.  It HAS to import cotton even if just for rotation of stocks.  I don't think USDA is terrible on China stocks...India stocks, well, that's another matter altogether.
2508 2019-04-12 14:17:22 with which liquidity? They need to lower rates..... boost the bond prices to insane bubble (as if they are not now) and than.... with the sale of them.... they will buy stocks.... 

So the bonds will bump and dump... and rates will go higher naturally
2509 2019-04-12 14:17:08 $WISA New play... reversal on the daily, super low float, and should run hard IMO. $2.15 is the breakout... ideal under said price. $3 ultimate target, but could see $4 in coming days

2558 2019-04-12 13:56:53 Well the reason the shoulders still have the tunic design is because if they were removed, there’s nothing underneath. So only the stocks have and chest were modeled. Maybe they had a reason, but it’s weird to take the time to model it if they weren’t gonna use it.

2579 2019-04-12 13:50:03 On these catalyst stocks, always use a stop loss. $TCON crashed since trial cancelled but $VTL skyrocketed. Better safe than sorry. Tcon has a trial result result coming, so I’d hold and accumulate since the price is now near rock bottom.
2580 2019-04-12 13:49:37 With our history with gun control and gun violence, it can logically be found that there are many methods of gun control that can lower gun violence.

2587 2019-04-12 13:46:51 Highlights stocks value versus asset value At oil at +60. Now we have Warren Buffett into Suncor & APC. Oil stocks generally are selling at biggest discount to market in many decades on many valuation measures such as EV/EBITDA, book value, This will get resolved.
2588 2019-04-12 13:46:37 Yes, this is industrial scale 'harvesting' of 'fish stocks', known to all ecologically aware people as the strip-mining of the oceans & driving fish populations to extinction. Best solution is to avoid all fish, switching to a plant-based diet, using organically grown local food.
2589 2019-04-12 13:46:36 My father, a family practice doctor, gave me Disney Stock as a wedding gift twenty years ago. Today, I'm really glad. @WCInvestor I think you should write a column about wedding registry stocks.

2594 2019-04-12 13:44:52 I kinda wish I could buy half-shares of stocks. Some of these stocks are like $300+ per share. Yeah, I know there's mutual funds, but what if I really believe in one specific company?

2597 2019-04-12 13:44:16 Honestly just being digital is not enough, that happened already decades ago with stocks. Decentralization and trustlessness is key for the future.
2598 2019-04-12 13:42:52 Semi stocks are doing well lately such as $AVGO，$NVDA, $AMD.  It may be wise to take off some profits as the market is back to all time high and some pull back is likely.  Plus earning report can cause large damage to your portfolio if you don’t size the position accordingly.

2605 2019-04-12 13:40:14 True for almost all businesses but not yours. You handsomely took clients money via fees and underperformed heavily destroying their wealth measured in US stocks as a "return". You managed to create a rare win-lose situation.

2618 2019-04-12 13:37:47 Stocks are so important to invest in if you’re going to continually spend your money at that place. For example I have stock in Walmart because I buy so much shit there, a certain percent goes right back to me.
2619 2019-04-12 13:37:46 What if it tells you to "dump" stocks?
2620 2019-04-12 13:37:25 Didn't you win our last set + moneymatch with two stocks when I SDed both times? 
2621 2019-04-12 13:36:48 Everything is possible even new ATH. However, I can still distinguish a bubble in the equity market from the actual economy. Stocks cannot be worth more than the entire economy. It is an illusion and a hall of mirrors.
2622 2019-04-12 13:36:28 Stocks are ripping higher following $JPM earnings and some upbeat Chinese data. S&P 500 has jumped above 2900, leaving it less than 1% from its closing record. $SPX
2623 2019-04-12 13:36:18 Not sure if you remember my earlier tweet :

Liquidity is Stock is Like Erection In Cock. Always invest in Stocks where you see Liquidity, Liquidity means Volumes Traded. Volumes will be high when Larger Market Controls the Holding and Not Just One Single Guy.
2624 2019-04-12 13:36:11 US Stocks trade higher due in part to strong earnings from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.

2628 2019-04-12 13:34:29 It definitely has the potential. The pullback is filling the gap from the substantial momentum spike. When crypto/stocks/anything spike, people will take profits.

It's almost like investors knew he was full of shit or something.
2669 2019-04-12 13:15:39 I don't disagree but I also don't think it's as "sector wide" as some of these plebs assume. Big reason why I'll only be looking at the smaller, unassociated stocks not stuck to the mother's teet of the ETF scene lol
2670 2019-04-12 13:15:24 I don't agree with you. It is coiling and this is the entry! But you are correct that I rarely consider stocks with price under the 10d MA as a valid entry. This one is the exception due to the clear technical support/resistance lines.

2678 2019-04-12 13:13:12 When Investing in a Stock, Don't Invest basis Price Movement or Looking at Price.

Stocks taken Basis Price is Trading.
Stocks taken Basis Business, Promoters, Industry, Performance, Future forecast is INVESTMENT.

In Investment, you buy business and not the Price.
2679 2019-04-12 13:12:13 @GolicAndWingo 1500 stocks in 1997 would currently be 18,000 after the stock split 3 times in the 90s 1st split 2-1 2nd split 3-1 3rd split 2-1 Amazon is trading at $1844 this morning $1844 x 18000 shares = $33,192,000 it would be hard to look at Grandpa the same way after that
2680 2019-04-12 13:11:47 Those stocks were not even close to pricing in $65 oil in Nov 2018. How about putting up same chart to Nov 2016 when oil was $55 average for that year. 200 plus %.
2681 2019-04-12 13:11:43 Stocks are up, which is nice if you own stock.
But how about if you don't own stock?
How about if you're one of those 40% of households who are one $400 emergency away from financial crisis?

2683 2019-04-12 13:11:27 This is why Janet Yellen pondered the use of buying stocks on the open market as a new tool..just like they do with Bonds huh?

Copper prices went up as much as 2% to $2.95 per pound on Friday, on the back of an increase in copper imports from China due to a decline in stocks
2689 2019-04-12 13:09:00 I don't mind a little risk tbh that's why I added Boeing, I'd love if it became one of my traded stocks since the prices is fluctuating a lot lately, that's how you make fast cash from stocks and yea it's risky but making 2k in a week or 2 for just waiting is worth the risk

With dry bulk  I like $NM because it has a mixed fleet so it's less likely to be hammered by low trade volumes in a particular sector. Also $EGLE

2694 2019-04-12 13:04:37 If I lose from it the Tesla stocks should regain that money, just want to check if a hunch I have is correct, won't lose toooo much if either falls since they're both close to their 3 month low 
I'm only buying 25 Boeing and 75 Tesla
2695 2019-04-12 13:03:32 No argument from me. CB are running the same book w/o a better result. China data gets worse while stocks rose on expectations data would improve. Inv care about saving stocks not economies and this lasts until it doesn't.

2698 2019-04-12 13:01:36 @MohnishPabrai's Ten Commandments of Investment Management

1. Don't skim off the top (don't charge fixed fees)
2. Don't have an investment team
3. Accept that you will be wrong 1/3rd of the time
4. Look for stocks with a HIDDEN P/E of 1 (ok if its based on future earnings)
2699 2019-04-12 13:01:24 Not holding stocks from yesterday? Market didn't make it easy. Time to rethink your plan?

2719 2019-04-12 12:49:47 Is this downtrend reacting to good bank earnings? Is money being taken out off crypto and again moved back to stock market? Feels like it, high volumes in market even though all stocks are priced premium.
2720 2019-04-12 12:49:46 lol could say that a bout a lot of pot stocks that met highs in early 2018 only go lower and lower ever month ever since.

2723 2019-04-12 12:47:40 @davidfaber in response to Joe’s question this morning about other media stocks getting sympathy bumps.

2747 2019-04-12 12:35:37 In other markets Mars is strong energy which produces large moves both ways. For stocks it can be strongest up in uptrend, but biggest down in downtrend. 

So it isn't that Mars is necessarily bad for BTC, it was that BTC was in negative environment & Mars was doing its thing.

2750 2019-04-12 12:34:27 @BobPisani It is ridiculous to keep saying stocks are "expensive" at 17x next year's earnings, but not at 16x, as if the market follows earnings that precisely.

2761 2019-04-12 12:28:17 How would you play this if you were looking for new entries? Wait for a while to buy US stocks if the price drops? Or buy Canadian, Russian, African, Australian stocks that might have been neglected in favour of US stocks in the run up to the decision?
2762 2019-04-12 12:27:55 Remind me what Studler's 'secret' .280 report said?  

As @TFB_Nathaniel_F observes, the US had already done intermediate calibres much better than us with the .276 Pedersen in the 1930s. Indeed, the US Army might have adopted it, if it hadn't had such large stocks of .30-06.

2767 2019-04-12 12:26:13 Market gained yesterday though, but gains were from the big boy stocks. My opinion, in this day and age people want two things, a sizable  return and security of investment. T bills and bonds give those more than equities.

2843 2019-04-12 11:40:27 I’ve fished the earn for salmon for 33 years and the decline has been steady going back before then. Seems to start around the time large scale salmon farms took off. First step - get these all moved inland where the wild stocks have no access to the lice infestation they have.
2844 2019-04-12 11:40:26 Seems to me that if one is using variable withdrawals (RMDs or other method) that the asset allocation affects the volatility of withdrawals -- so choice is more stocks and higher expected but more volatile withdrawals or lower average but more stable.

2887 2019-04-12 11:19:06 is about a buck when its 52 week high was $2.64 or so.  For me the U stocks are holding back so there is a message there.  Big Money has their way of knowing things early and look what we see.  So, this makes Sunday and Monday and even today a very interesting short period.

3041 2019-04-12 08:54:29 I totally agree with you guys. This is one of the reasons I dislike Twitter at times & don’t bother posting coz I’m sick of seeing certain posters who appear smug & sanctimonious like their sh*t doesn’t stink. Well it does & so do your shit stocks too so go concentrate on them.

3043 2019-04-12 08:52:20 Is it the land being compensated or the developments done on these farms mainly infrastructures and live stocks koz as far as I know we didn't take back only the Land but we went as far as to take even lives

3049 2019-04-12 08:49:24 I feel heartily sorry for the quandary that business now finds itself in. Prepared for no Deal and now left in limbo with accumulated stocks, plans etc. What a fiasco.
3050 2019-04-12 08:44:47 Yep I totally agree. Everyone is aware of the risks of AIM - it doesn't need to be rammed down everyones throats every 2 mins. If you can't handle the risk/volatility of stocks then AIM simply isn't for you, and if you can handle it, you're probably sensible enough to be aware.

3081 2019-04-12 08:13:02 Agree, Greenblatt is really a storyteller which is fine if that's what you bought the book for. Also, I am not a fan of Earnings Yield which is 1/2 of his factoring approach. I did passively study his approach for a few years in UK stocks and at best gave average performance.

3200 2019-04-12 06:08:54 I guess market has become so trendless that option buying has become non-profitable. Stocks are up one day and down the next and in between option values dies. By the time, stock reaches your target point, either SL has been hit or option value has died.What say?

3286 2019-04-12 04:41:05 can you please share that formula , will test them on a number of stocks , i also tested one formula it worked but then it started hitting SL. it was based on fibo numbers , calculation based on previous days high low close
3287 2019-04-12 04:41:04 UEX has a history of making big moves, expect it will rip through .185 200 day MA on volume before too long. Also opportunity to pick up bonus CO-EX shares,  Cobalt price picking up again and +++ outlook. Lots to like, trading like the Rodney Dangerfield of Athabasca U stocks!

3296 2019-04-12 04:31:25 It’s like the MSM for stocks
3297 2019-04-12 04:30:51 I understand your point. The amount of content they have helping learn to trade is abundant. 1 of my struggles was finding quality stocks to trade. The MIC chatroom enabled me to find profitable stocks I’d never find on my own. One monthly fee, day 1 already up more than the fee

3303 2019-04-12 04:26:10 BP & BPMP stocks are coming up.
good entry point
3304 2019-04-12 04:25:58 It's a question of time frames as usual - Trading or investing???

Today, this week, this month, this year, next? - different answers

Stocks dip, bonds rally - we could see that

Close above 2.55% and we may see 2.82% again...

But lowflation equals value in FI, just about entry
3305 2019-04-12 04:23:10 Same can be said for stocks like coal India others as well, PNb housing but stocks go to new heights every 5 years. Real estate has a 20 year cycle so it you see from 2002 or 2004 level, it's just eye opening
3306 2019-04-12 04:21:44 liar? "I trade it...." Sure you do! I can't cure your disorder. You're a hell-bent stalker who is in denial. Thousands of stocks and your answer is more denial like only a woman could be capable of like you. I've seen it all
3307 2019-04-12 04:20:16 I am shocked at the accuracy of the formula, The stock i tested on was ONGC, WIPRO and they both opened at the same point the formula given me the price. Not even a cent here and there.

And best part is as per formula the both stocks playing exactly open close till now,
3308 2019-04-12 04:19:56 And i couldn't care less about the next ygngg blackpink is now the leading artist of yg and that's it. YG themselves admitted that they expect blackpink to improve their company's performance. Blackpink's comeback announcement alone raised yg's stocks.
3309 2019-04-12 04:18:30 There is a formula devised by a very legendary #Trader i have been following and reading his tips about the guess work of next days open and same days close through 2 simple formulas.

Today tested it on two stocks and result are 100% accurate of the open. Now waiting for dayend.

3314 2019-04-12 04:10:03 Thanks for you knowledge sharing. I have a small concern here. This vwap technic will work all trending instruments. But it will hit ur stops during sideways moves. Can u pls share any tip to find the trending stocks any instruments. Thanks in advance.
3315 2019-04-12 04:09:29 When I get well enough to design again - stocks or no stocks for the next series
3316 2019-04-12 04:09:26 Hehehe sa Agrarian Law na iyan ni Cory .

Stock Distribution Option, instead of giving back land, farmers are given stocks supposedly earning from the company. 
It's close to worthless.

Hacienda Luisita benefited from this option.
3317 2019-04-12 04:09:04 Also Even in stocks, outstanding and or stipulated shares are still part of the Market cap but we don’t even have to get into that as escrow isn’t legally binding anyway (refer to Forbes)
3318 2019-04-12 04:09:03 Not market, exchange. Some kind of exchange if not necessarily stocks.

3338 2019-04-12 03:44:23 The thing about $tsla is
If it really breaks 250/260 support 
It goes to 150 or so to. consolidate for a number of weeks
Then to 35 to 50

Most importantly 
If/when it really breaks 
It won't come back ever

When overvalued stocks break they don't come back

3370 2019-04-12 03:10:31 I’ve been thinking about doing the same. It’s no secret why Warren Buffett’s favorite time to buy stocks is at the depths of a recession. Unfortunately, we don’t know when that will happen.
3371 2019-04-12 03:09:29 Neel , you state that QE and FED monetary policy has created jobs and supported the economy, is it not true that the abundance of easy money has in fact INFLATED ASSETS to ridiculous levels that will ultimately deflate - like tech stocks, housing, etc, destroying jobs and the eco

3405 2019-04-12 02:44:32 And he is also missing the fact that the federal reserve can expand the money supply. There was literally “more money” which mainly went to stocks from banks due to our fractional reserve banking system. That will lead to a bubble.

3414 2019-04-12 02:33:42 It’s ridiculous. I found a little gas station here in town that stocks more craft beer than they do. However, they will now order what I ask for if they can get it. Some progress is better than none I suppose.

3421 2019-04-12 02:30:59 Ok Bharath. Its important to watch out stocks after such massive selling to check if it was real or trap. Therefore, next 1-3 days sessions are important. Keep an eye to spot high probability trades.

elite smash btw, thanks nintendo
3431 2019-04-12 02:27:35 bottom line, IMHO, if you close down the outflows and you have all these inflows ( bonds and stocks ), and specifically UST holdings by Asian CB ( Russia too ) are being swapped for CNY bond holdings over tie, then USDCNY has one way to go. 6.00 before 7.00 #FX

3459 2019-04-12 02:06:56 They mostly certainly do exacerbate wealth and income inequality. Here's how:

The rich own assets like stocks and property, which benefit from the inflation created by central banks and fiat currencies.

The poor and middle class have few assets, yet face higher living costs.

3492 2019-04-12 01:42:29  we talking stocks?
3493 2019-04-12 01:40:31 Wall St very short term. I was a sell side analyst for 11 years. Mostly fun, but that short term focus drove me crazy. I agree with Cathy ... multi-year focus on growth stocks gives best return, less emotional BS, more focus on actual technology.
3494 2019-04-12 01:40:03 My favorite thing to do watching Superstore is look at what's in the store to see who is paying for promotional consideration and who isn't. Cloud 9 stocks card Who RSVP, not Hallmark.
3495 2019-04-12 01:38:34 Dried beans and stocks for me. I can cook dry chickpeas in 45 min, instead of having to soak over night and cook for over an hour.
3496 2019-04-12 01:37:40 thats a fair point. where I get most my stocks is ledge trapping in the inkling mu and if they choose to go the circle camp route I feel ken covers those options well. plus up air medium kills them mad early. Ill have to try ryu in that mu
3497 2019-04-12 01:36:38 As to Congressional imprisonment, I'm torn between 2 days of being put in "The Stocks," perhaps at a Chuck E Cheese or 5 days detained residence at an inner city Motel 6. I'm good with either one.

3500 2019-04-12 01:36:19 The province of BC needs to pay their fair share of #climatechange, they have mining operations obliterating the environment & incredibly high rates of deforestation, which would help stem climate change.

3501 2019-04-12 01:35:03 A question that is often asked is, "Okay, I bought the stock and it's rising. Now what do I do"? For most people, unless a target like +20% or selling into strength is used, breaks of moving avgs is likely the best choice to exit a winner. #stocks

3507 2019-04-12 01:29:20 “The banks are the group that sets the tone for earnings season, and that’s a lucky thing because this time their stocks are coming in ice cold, which means that they should be able to rally on even the slightest positive provocation,” the “Mad Money” host said.

3516 2019-04-12 01:18:56 I'm trying to teach myself that there are just a lot of adults who are too dumb to recognize distinctions between stocks and flows, levels and rates, etc.

They will forever be bewildered and there's really nothing I can do.
3517 2019-04-12 01:18:09 Yeah definitely hasn't ripped yet. I meant that it was rallying across the board today, and has refused to go down despite the Fed's efforts. That's what I think all this jawboning has really been about. Yes prop up stocks, but really to keep a lid on the dollar.
3518 2019-04-12 01:17:36 20-bagger    =   +1900%

A diversified portfolio of high-growth, small-cap stocks is a pretty smart 10-year investment approach.
3519 2019-04-12 01:16:30 A common misunderstanding is that shorts are short stocks because they want them to fail. I am long over 100 stocks. The stocks I am short I am short because I believe they will fail. If Tesla could deliver it's promises, I'd close my position tomorrow.

3534 2019-04-12 01:00:17 Despite the lethargy in the averages this week and the decay in a few names, the past couple of sessions have seen some glamours perk up $MDB $YETI $DOMO $PS $DOCU among others, a sign that the speculative sentiment remains #stocks
3535 2019-04-12 00:59:59 My boss trade stocks. We might just be best buddies
3536 2019-04-12 00:56:42 Posting it twice don’t make it a fact or even relevant. Nancy sure is rich pandering to offshore globalist, brokering deals then moving stocks to get wealthy before pushing legislation. Let’s not forget her deep rooted financial ties to the ChiComs, narcos, the Uranium One deal

Also GOP: We will limit a woman's right to make choices for her own body, & we expect that everyone will follow them & abortion will end
3541 2019-04-12 00:55:14 I have realized most of my very good cooking accomplishments are making giant batches of stocks and sauces and freezing them until needed. Super quick pesto salmon has been nice tonight.

3543 2019-04-12 00:54:44 Hope so. But back in 1999 fuel cell stocks went through the roof with predictions they would power all cars by 2009. Now they are virtually penny stocks. Hydrogen fill-ups turned out to be unfeasible.

3552 2019-04-12 00:47:55 increasing news coverage and discussion => greed => FOMO

perfect recipe for blow-off tops

guess the stock market top won't be in until she calls me saying she wants to put all her savings into FANG stocks? 
3553 2019-04-12 00:46:44 Not really. Supply and demand. Simple macro as I said. 

Gotta buy on the lows and sell on the highs. Sounds elementary and cliché, but is very true. 

Look at bargains that have potential. That's whether we are talking stocks, real estate, etc.
3554 2019-04-12 00:45:41 Hitting the road this weekend to sell some AEW penny stocks. Look for me at a wrestling show in your local area and if you're following me here on twitter I'll give you ONE HUNDRED shares of AEW for FREE~!
3555 2019-04-12 00:44:45 BA is the biggest holding in the dow so, for sure, a run in ba can drive up doe stocks like aapl even if not correlated.  But amzn not really.. but good luck my friend ! Have a nice trading day
3556 2019-04-12 00:43:59 @Trump2015US need to realize top 10% in income own 80% of stocks. So who benefitted from TaxScam giving corps significant tax break? Households with incomes less than $104K represent 70% of tax paying households, but only received 30% of tax break.  Wake up to Truth. #NeverTrump
3557 2019-04-12 00:43:30 Which stocks are you bullish on other than Tesla? I concur with your views on Tesla and would like to know your other favorite stocks

3559 2019-04-12 00:42:35 @marc_milam  Last year sep , i noticed growth stocks like carvana Etc etc were the first one to start correcting before overall mkt. Now i see twtr gurus are all chasing a handful of growth stocks like $ZS $CRM etc. Coincidence  or happy days are just around the corner 
3560 2019-04-12 00:42:03 Recuerdo Haber analizado los últimos  precios cuidados con las listas de costo de esos ítems !!! NINGUNO tenía un margen inferior al 60% Más allá de ser productos en presentaciones de las menos  vendidas. Muy Buena oportunidad de reducir Stocks. Cuanto quieren ganar estos HDP ??
3561 2019-04-12 00:41:17 Maybe it’s a good thing they don’t allow you to buy individual stocks with your 401k money because otherwise I’d probably do something crazy and buy all I can $uber with my retirement pennies
3562 2019-04-12 00:40:56 @RyannLogann never should have sold those stocks
3563 2019-04-12 00:38:41 3 to 1 call volume...ok sounds like all the gamblers betting on upside after the stocks have already bounced significantly off their lows.  Fade it.

3574 2019-04-12 00:28:53 What labor though? What factory this dude work at? What things has he physically produced? Having employees that make things for your company, owning stocks that passively make money--these things are not labor. Investments enhance his bank account, not lives.

3580 2019-04-12 00:25:19 Many stocks can stay in overbought territory for a long time. Everything depends on story and context. $ZKIN stayed oversold for like 5 months on a weekly chart with very low RSI to give you a flip side argument. Stockhastics and RSI are only ever one part of a much larger puzzle

3591 2019-04-12 00:15:53 As I understand, Buffett makes his money from investments. Investments make money from the value of company, something determined by speculation and value taken from the worker. However, it's not any labor of the investor that increases the value of his stocks 1/2
3592 2019-04-12 00:14:46 Technically speaking, there aren't any more Warner stocks, they're all $T now, but I don't think they're dropping. They haven't revealed their wares yet. 
But Netflix? Yeah, they're boned. Why settle for some off-brand from Russia when you can get the Disney library for $5 less?
3593 2019-04-12 00:14:26 $OIL to test back $60-62 zone in coming weeks and so the retrace on $BPT and all oil stocks, who are struggling to move up from current price.
3594 2019-04-12 00:11:45 Lakers snagged two stocks on the best player in the tiers above them, but still put up a decently refined free throw and
3595 2019-04-12 00:11:31 Well now the bump stocks are banned which I was fine with and all mass shooting are committed at close range. Your excuses for the ban keeps changing but you don’t seem to know anything about guns.
3596 2019-04-12 00:10:58 No link between $BA and $AMZN. At all...  IF market on fire. All stocks goes up.  But if $BA runs on news, won’t follow bc not correlated al all. I can tell you this.  Remember that
3597 2019-04-12 00:10:30 My stocks went up 3.24%
3598 2019-04-12 00:09:41 The way they can be manipulated? Again the Vegas shooter essentially made an automatic weapon with bump stocks with his AR, the same couldn’t be done with a hand gun, plus the range of a hand gun is significantly smaller
3599 2019-04-12 00:09:18 When a company gives stock options and the stock price surges, they are able to deduct it from corporate taxes. That's why Amazon paid 0 in Corporate taxes this year. Furthermore, amazon invests more than it buys back stocks so they can deduct even more costs.
3600 2019-04-12 00:08:16 I had zero intention of signing up for any other streaming services, but that price point is perfect. 

Netflix and Warner stocks are gonna drop hard tomorrow morning.
