42 2018-02-03 23:57:12 Thank you Ian afew glasses down now lol
43 2018-02-03 23:56:48 Yeah ok. Our pump I think has been abused in the past. Have put a new kit through but now leaking oil and sounds a bit rough so think time to upgrade.
44 2018-02-03 23:56:46 The water you cook the pasta in is also added , again by eye...oh...forgot crushed red hot chili peppers....that goes in with the oil when you fry...top with grated parm

53 2018-02-03 23:55:34 Of course no one does it on purpose. But history shows SHIT HAPPENS! Add in the fact the Salish Sea is already a dangerous archipelago and it's an extreme risk. The oil company declares bankruptcy and BC gets stuck with the bill, destroyed ecosystem, and destroyed industries.
54 2018-02-03 23:55:30 Hmmm Italians don't use recipes...It's all by eye and taste...basically you put olive oil, chopped parsley and lots of chopped garlic in a tiny pot, fry it up very slowly and gently, making sure not to burn the garlic, then add finely grated bread crumbs...
55 2018-02-03 23:55:29 Sometimes it feels like a sick joke that I pay for the oil that heats up every room in the house but my own! But then I get yelled at not to use my electric heater too much and increase the electric bill!
56 2018-02-03 23:55:26 No. I’ll tie it securely and rub oil on it.

62 2018-02-03 23:54:32 So disingenuous when they huff and puff about rates vs mainland. Hawaii, another island has higher rates. They haven't invested to get off oil.  Rsa was going to enable investment. Just another excuse to flout law. A receiver would help so much.

72 2018-02-03 23:51:35 The tax cut savings I may get will offset the higher gas & heating oil costs. I wonder what a millionaire will do with their tax cut money.

75 2018-02-03 23:50:59 Inforwars, a place that promoted Pizzagate and a number of other debunked conspiracies, and tries its hardest to get you to order snake oil health products to line their pockets. Great shit.
76 2018-02-03 23:50:59 why go straight to 'shut down' rhetoric? very few enviros say oil production must stop. 

just stop expanding.

market forces will do so in 5 or 10 years anyway. but AB could be proactive and start to diversify now.
77 2018-02-03 23:50:44 I am doing both, but we are in an emergency of defunding support systems that tens of millions depend on.  Do you know when Putin was "elected", he and a class of oligarchs (wealthy billionaires) raided the gov $ & public oil, etc taking it to indiv accts.  They'll do it here.
78 2018-02-03 23:50:41 Rule #3 — Oil and seasoning on every sandwich. I don’t care if it’s a cheesesteak. Customer doesn’t want it? Boom, out of on his fucking head. You won’t see him no more.

84 2018-02-03 23:49:48 Girl nooo but it's so good like that. It had pesto, cherry tomatoes, arugula, bell peppers, red onions, eggplant, walnuts, coconut oil & mushroom girlll tbh it was way too good
85 2018-02-03 23:49:42 Yesss. I love them! I buy the regular ones though and put them in the oven with balsamic glaze, grape seed oil, and TJ’s 21 seasoning salute. It’s sooo good!!
86 2018-02-03 23:49:39 We're a coastal maritime industry country not a foreign owned oil exporter. You can't do both.
87 2018-02-03 23:49:38 and i have oil left over so i could make some frenchy fries
might not be a good idea to cook with hot oil rn tho lol
88 2018-02-03 23:49:26 I haven’t looked into it but would wonder how much fish oil they fed the mice. Also was it rancid or fresh. Fish oil even fresh is meant to be consumed in small (trace) quantities. Olive oil benefits not surprising- I recommend it as main dietary oil to be consumed liberally.

106 2018-02-03 23:46:10 Its amazing that the rest of Canada cant fathom that ever since PET and the NEB our conservative govts in Alberta have sold the oil industry downstream to texas,and Harper just nailed the coffin shut.our only place to get full payment is from china.

If the Scottish Government actually controlled the North Sea oil taxation and revenues, do you think idiots like you would exist  
112 2018-02-03 23:45:26 Curious to know if that would work. If Canada stopped importing oil from Algeria, Saudi Arabia and all the other beautiful places I never want to return too, Could Alberta be prosperous just producing oil for Canada and the United States? No need for a pipeline to the coast.

135 2018-02-03 23:41:58 so your admitting us pesky Scots have been #Subsidizing #JokeMinster since our oil was discovered back in the 70's and that for decades various Red & Blue Tories have squandered it all away without even having the good sense to put some by like Norway or Shetland Isle #IndyRef2

149 2018-02-03 23:39:11 They said I had bell palsy, so my uncle came through gave me a massage with baby oil and arnica
150 2018-02-03 23:39:01 Tell that to a 3rd world country...they depend on coal/oil now..not in 10 years when your so-called green energy is sustainable.
151 2018-02-03 23:39:00 Yep. I salvaged a pair of suede boots that got an oil stain on them by spraying the entire pair of boots in nonstick cooking spray. When in doubt, even it out.

153 2018-02-03 23:38:34 The Nathan E Stewart spill off Bella Bella last year is a perfect example of the FAILUE that is clean up response. The booms broke on a hourly basis from winds and waves. The dispersants cause more harm to local wildlife than the oil. Let alone the long term effects to pub health
154 2018-02-03 23:38:31 We stop the oil cycle by closing the fuel tanks in our cars
155 2018-02-03 23:38:03 Hahaha no talking about beer....couple of my boys call all day drinking a oil spill.

159 2018-02-03 23:37:09 The fact Libya (the post war country treating immigrants inhumanly while the world sits back idly) is here is confusing. I get that reconstruction backed by oil money accounts for this but still...
160 2018-02-03 23:37:07 if u have sleeping problems i highly recommend huffing lavender oil before bed i slept like a god damn baby u guys
161 2018-02-03 23:37:03 Oil heat Joe?
162 2018-02-03 23:37:02 Will have the baby oil and tissues at the ready for #UsykGassiev 
163 2018-02-03 23:37:01 Was in there one night & the serious table-football gang had a can of '3 in 1' oil & was oiling the springs!
164 2018-02-03 23:36:52 The oil change that I got today will last me for a year
165 2018-02-03 23:36:24 Absolutely, primary interest today (along with Russia) is to settle more and more oil transactions in Yuan vs US dollar...
166 2018-02-03 23:36:13 we produce shale oil which needs higher oil prices to be profitable aka the whole point of peak oil. It means the peak in conventional forms of oil aka not shale
167 2018-02-03 23:36:01 Atleast this guy has a real reason to put oil on himself at the gym
168 2018-02-03 23:35:58 have you tried murphy's oil soap
169 2018-02-03 23:35:42 /That's/ what we forgot, more cooking oil!
170 2018-02-03 23:35:38 I don't think he was. 
People loved him.
Free healthcare, money for newly weds to buy houses, shares of oil, etc. He was a good guy demonized by the msm cos govs. had an agenda there
171 2018-02-03 23:35:36 Hahahahaha. Terry was drilling for oil. He was pulled out of position all night
172 2018-02-03 23:35:29 You got it out the mud, I got it out the oil
173 2018-02-03 23:35:23 I am not sure how ink is made. Or is it found, like oil?
174 2018-02-03 23:34:58 Alberta's not a unified voting bloc, like the Borg or something, just a province where the oil industry has had too much influence on our political narratives.
175 2018-02-03 23:34:54 You're missing out man. It's not about cleaning it, but caring for it. That beard oil does gods work.

182 2018-02-03 23:33:27 can anyone recommend a good beard oil?
183 2018-02-03 23:33:19 But is that to do with when we did our pgces? I do remember vak planning and lavender oil for a calming atmosphere and oh so much bloody brain gym...
184 2018-02-03 23:33:16 That’s an interesting method I always have coconut oil bc of my curls so I will definitely try it out!
185 2018-02-03 23:32:59 I just want my cbd oil
186 2018-02-03 23:32:57 Poor taste and quality. Fries are soggy and tasteless, the chicken taste like it's just been oil massaged.
187 2018-02-03 23:32:48 I made a simple oil mix of sweet almond oil, jbco, and fennel powder. And oiled his scalp before the retwist. I used the coconut oil eco styler gel. It’s enough to hold the retwist but not so hard that it breaks the hair.
188 2018-02-03 23:32:46 What nonsense. Everyone knows you're supposed to eat fish oil capsules to learn more better.

191 2018-02-03 23:32:24 awww your first tattoo is always so exciting! I would recommend using melted coconut oil as a moisturizer while it's healing since it's not thick and won't suffocate your tattoo! I don't know of anyone else who uses that method but it works great for me

193 2018-02-03 23:32:11 one big problem we use twice as much as we produce and we we import is much cheaper form of oil
194 2018-02-03 23:31:59 Want to kick cold and flu symptoms? Get yourself a head of garlic, roast that sucker in olive oil in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes in foil and eat the entire thing throughout the day. Trust me. #imvegan
195 2018-02-03 23:31:30 Yeah they were a bit harder in the East End in those days! No beard oil. Last time I was at the Barras the Clyde was frozen but the kids were still in crop-tops!
196 2018-02-03 23:31:22 So, even though I’ve worked in kitchens for 7 years, I still have no idea how to tell when oil is hot enough, without flicking water into it.

201 2018-02-03 23:30:44 It’s easy, but best of you blend all the herbs together separately then fold them into the potatoes with olive oil and garlic already added in. It’s a really fragrant flavorful recipe. It’s also a tad spicy because of the crushed red pepper

222 2018-02-03 23:28:00 problem is we use twice as much . Where does that reminder come from? The middle east which produces a much cheaper form of oil

230 2018-02-03 23:26:53 "responsibly-produced" Oil? Is that like clean coal? Oil sands is some of the most environmentally-damaging oil production there is. And building more oil infrastructure is extremely short-sighted.
231 2018-02-03 23:26:51 Sautéed halved brussel sprouts and sliced leeks in olive oil and butter, after the’re browned add some white wine and lemon zest, salt and pepper. Serve over pasta with a sprinkle of parsley and Parmesan. I also sautéed some chopped walnuts. Yumm

Jeremy, you fanny 
240 2018-02-03 23:25:36 They only hint at the real issue, which is the continued overwhelming reliance on oil/gas sector to make up virtually all of our economy.  Especially after the 1980 bust and the 2014 (and other) price drops.  Tulsa diversified some, but oil still reigns.
241 2018-02-03 23:25:31 Is this the oil yir talking aboot or your arguments
242 2018-02-03 23:25:25 Ocean based oil spills can NOT be cleaned. The target for a successful clean up by Kinder Morgan is 5%. That is their standard of success. The Salish Sea biodeiversity is the most diverse in NA. The environmental and economical impacts from a spill would destroy BC.
243 2018-02-03 23:25:06 From what I've read it's not the high temperature. Its the difference in temperature. So taking a room temperature glass item and plunging it into hot oil may be more of a sudden difference than the glass can withstand
244 2018-02-03 23:24:59 I bought some for my husband, to see if it would help alleviate any of his pain but it doesn’t have cannabis in it so it’s not effective. He goes for a checkup in March, wondering if it has helped his kidneys. I’ll be glad when we can legally buy cannabis oil in TN.
245 2018-02-03 23:24:58 I’ve got plenty of facts. Oil spills happen. Ask LA. Ask CA. Is the need great enough for the risk? Most of us say no.
246 2018-02-03 23:24:24 Biggest prob is Alberta waits & waits for oil 2 come back while rest of the world wants 2 use less & less. Oil is old tech, wrecking the earth. Encourage new tech/use AB’s huge workforce/assets to grow new economy. AB doesn’t need more oil, needs forward thinking business people.

But also with IMO regulations coming up sulphur in fuel oil will become a headache for refiners. So my guess is that LSB will have to sell at discount even with better mid dists
268 2018-02-03 23:21:51 By the way, how long did it take to get the smell of the burning oil out of everything?

273 2018-02-03 23:21:00 Something made out of Pyrex might. But most of those things were made to withstand boiling water. Don't think it's meant to withstand oil that's 200 degrees hotter

296 2018-02-03 23:17:38 argan and/or almond oil applied directly to the scalp (parting the hair at a few different spots on the head), & cantu brand coconut curling cream or coconut oil hair gel as a styling agent. wash once a week, also with cantu shampoo/conditioner.
297 2018-02-03 23:17:04 There is not a country in the world that if they had our oil reserves would leave it in the ground.
298 2018-02-03 23:16:39 It was discovered a few decades ago, but not publicized, that petroleum is not from fossils, but from a self-renewing geological process. The underground oil reservoirs renew themselves.  This is not a joke.
299 2018-02-03 23:16:38 Garak, Miles suggested I get a "dispensable ensign" to apply the oil this time
300 2018-02-03 23:16:07 I applied coconut oil on my hair and fell asleep lol

Not this post, the other ones
I post!
304 2018-02-03 23:15:41 I think the scientific community does need a Captain Obvious. There is constant utopian talk of a world without oil. Despite its problems I like oil. And it should be counted as a blessing not to be wasted. So much of it is wasted.
305 2018-02-03 23:15:32 Harding off a scramble in front.  Oilers with their first lead of the game. 6-5.
306 2018-02-03 23:15:21 Dear Oil & Gas Industry,
At least OK Wind Producers aren’t waging a full-scale attack on my home, water quality, and the environment. You are robbing our state blind, and leaving our homes crumbling.

314 2018-02-03 23:14:43 Gotta love that $20 oil change 
315 2018-02-03 23:14:33 I think it is. I haven’t run into a melted tube since. Although @repkord thinks it’s snake oil 
316 2018-02-03 23:14:25 14. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

320 2018-02-03 23:14:03 @abdaniellesmith I live in BC. I agree with you. Govt of BC is insane. Doing the wishes of 3 Green MLAs. Do we prefer Alberta oil or other? Is oil spill ok in other parts of the world? Crazy to think we are addicted to cars but hate the fuel. Keep fighting Alberta. We need you

323 2018-02-03 23:13:29 People don’t vote because they think they won’t get anything for it. Yeah, it’s not a way to win prizes. It’s going to the dentist, cleaning your gutters, changing your oil. Do it so bad shit doesn’t happen.
324 2018-02-03 23:13:15 I’m all for building pipelines, at the end of the day it’s better than driving the oil to Texas and back, but we can’t just destroy sacred lands or displace people to build it.
325 2018-02-03 23:12:53 Looks like she got the, "Bag of Oranges" for adding the wrong viscosity motor oil..

342 2018-02-03 23:10:09 There was not a drop of Alberta oil on the train in Lac Magantic -not that it matters to those grieving.  My point was simply that pipelines are safer, cleaner, more efficient.

344 2018-02-03 23:09:56 @AskHershey is the palm oil u use sustainably and responsibly sourced?
345 2018-02-03 23:09:32 I bet large scale inland fish hatcheries would consume less resources & do less damage to coastal habitat than fish farms. Take the oil outta our the pipelines and start pumping H2O! species genetically engineered to be giant would have less chance of escaping in, say Nevada

350 2018-02-03 23:08:40 1.) Grab a potato
2.) Clean the potato well
3.) Stab it a few times 
4.) Put it in a plastic grocery bag and put some oil or butter (whichever you prefer)
5.) Tie the bag and put a small hole on the top.
6.) Microwave it for about 5 minutes
7.) Add topping and enjoy ^-^

358 2018-02-03 23:07:28 Or they don't believe the hype of renewal energy will affect the Oil price and demand growth in the long future.
359 2018-02-03 23:07:24 Agreed but still a concern, makes the market very vulnerable to a long squeeze if any holes appear in the bull case for oil
360 2018-02-03 23:07:21 I try and avoid foods containing palm oil even where it's claimed to have been ethically sourced but it's increasingly challenging.
361 2018-02-03 23:06:31 Oil is already running out in lighter

362 2018-02-03 23:06:21 Animal Shampoo is used by professional animal groomers and vets all over the world. 

Dishwashing liquid is used to save animals from oil spills. 

Shampoo can literally save an animal's life, due to spills or parasites.

Nothing to do with pharma.

367 2018-02-03 23:05:28 This should be the right way to put it.
Not every finger gets stained when oil touches the hand.
368 2018-02-03 23:05:28 i hate the fact an oil change for my car is $150
369 2018-02-03 23:05:23 DO NOT PUT ANY SORT OF HEAT ON IT NOT EVEN THE DRYER HEAT CUS THE OIL WILL SET IF U DO
370 2018-02-03 23:05:09 I tried to make my own arizona iced tea but i guess vegetable oil isn't an ingredient 
371 2018-02-03 23:05:02 AT THA SAME DAMN TIME. TEA TREE OIL ON YA EDGES AND IN YA BUTT, MMKAY!?
372 2018-02-03 23:04:31 Those things really stung, I was walking in the #Target parking lot.  Streets in NW CR are you a little slick in places, but I think that was oil on the ground and not the ice.
373 2018-02-03 23:04:07 i need to buy new oil paints tbh..... need to practice more
374 2018-02-03 23:04:02 We sanction Russia's oik producers and etc. So the EU with the Poles and Ukraine crooks can profit from the oil. Russia and China along with Sauds buying up gold. They are getting ready. Russia has bunkers and we don't. Ukraine Nationalist/Nazi want overthrow current Govt

390 2018-02-03 23:02:18 @RealShaunLewin I am for Off Shore Oil Drilling. We as a country need all the oil we can get and with higher technology it's safer to drill off shore.. My 2 cents.
391 2018-02-03 23:01:56 Coconut oil in my hair <<  done using that
392 2018-02-03 23:01:50 Because the sun is weak at high latitudes. Subsistence is possible but modern lifestyles are not. Norway has vast deposits of oil which is why their society has been able to prosper in the modern age.
393 2018-02-03 23:01:49 Unlike traditional oil, the safest way by far to transport bitumen is by train as a solid. While no energy source is completely benign, to even suggest that fossil fuel use for solar and wind compare to non-renewables is grossly misleading.
394 2018-02-03 23:01:39 $1.50 : Not even enough to buy the oil to use on the squeaky #Crumbgate

Phase 2: 2tsp Epsom salt -natural laxative. Grapefruit juice, tea, electrolyte water.
Phase 3: begins tomorrow morn. Take shot of olive oil. Stimulates gallbladder to flush out.

397 2018-02-03 23:00:54 Sorry, but that’s laughable. Let’s look at the life cycle of oil propelled boats for comparison.
398 2018-02-03 23:00:54 I'm having trouble with a pipeline wholly owned by a Canadian company, shipping Canadian oil through the US, primarily the purpose of exporting it to the world beyond, being touted as "American infrastructure".

402 2018-02-03 23:00:14 You got some magic snake oil. Just use it. I swear it works. You said so.
403 2018-02-03 23:00:12 get to bed and snuggle! I am but it's just me and my duvet and the oil filled mobile radiator right now. But even then, I'm snuggling down.
404 2018-02-03 23:00:08 There's really nothing you can do with a dying stepper motor. You'd have to disassemble the entire housing to get at anything, and if the bearings are trashed, then oil isn't going to help much.
405 2018-02-03 23:00:04 Stop being such obvious oil shills and fix our bridges and dams. Our "infrastructure" problems weren't about goddamn pipelines.
406 2018-02-03 23:00:02 It never fails that I always pick the slowest line when I'm trying to get my oil changed 
407 2018-02-03 23:00:01 all he said was well i did this n i did that, never mentioned that his state built up because of the oil, had nothing to do with him..  sad thing  now his state not doing so well .. yes kay sick  did it... lol
408 2018-02-03 22:59:56 The fact is is that @GOO met with the Russians at the Mayflower Hotel - they are all guilty which is why they won’t oust #Trump - it was all about the oil!!!!!!!!
409 2018-02-03 22:59:54 Considering switching my account from @AskNationwide on account of the fact those "we're being all quirky here!" sisters adverts make me want to pour white hot oil into my eardrums and gouge out my eyeballs with a rusty fork. PLEASE STOP. 
410 2018-02-03 22:59:46 This boy I met on Tinder is literally changing my oil, took me to get my car washed, unloaded my trunk at goodwill, took me to Chipotle and now we’re going to the movies. Like I thought this breed of man was dead?
411 2018-02-03 22:59:32 Just check how much public and private money has or is planning to be invested in coal mining and how much will be or is planning to be invested in gas and oil exploration at the same time, you will see what Trump and his government is really doing.

414 2018-02-03 22:59:06 Is that the Oil Kings?
415 2018-02-03 22:58:28 Keep up the pressure. Hydrocarbon pollution of ground water lasts generations, far longer than any economic benefits of finding oil.
416 2018-02-03 22:58:26 more difficult than you would think to find cold-pressed, organic snake oil
417 2018-02-03 22:58:26 The way @realmadriden are going down, they might find crude oil soon
418 2018-02-03 22:58:21 Rien ne se perd et rien ne se crée, tout se transforme. (Lavoisier) you’ll need to be more precise to convince anyone batteries are worse than oil.
419 2018-02-03 22:58:08 Except they don’t hedge oil prices?? Writing was on wall for this one I think
420 2018-02-03 22:58:00 Gotta save the oil afterwards to reuse.

422 2018-02-03 22:57:53 Would they get subsidized if they made an ice sculpture of an off shore oil platform? Or is that forbidden?
423 2018-02-03 22:57:40 @HeyAprill you recently posted about the different oils and their uses. And how they all trump coconut oil. Where can I find that? I need one for hair, was it jojoba?
424 2018-02-03 22:57:34 Time to put that Pruett Racing Oil back into production! 
425 2018-02-03 22:57:20 It’s pretty crazy how expensive oil is for your car 
426 2018-02-03 22:57:20 it seemed impossible to begin with, my goal was to boycott the worst offenders such as Unilever Nestle Pepsi Cadbury etc but it did get easier over time. Holland & Barett do a cheap olive oil soap and astonish cleaning products (trigger sprays only) are all palmoilfree & 89p 
427 2018-02-03 22:57:14 It is probably more green to use Saudi sweet Oil than Alberta bitumen. Who gets the $ is compelling for self interest but not a moral argument. The human rights argument bears legitimacy before run away climate change is considered & fails if catastrophic climate change occurs.
428 2018-02-03 22:56:58 Got an oil change, car wash, and hair cut... I’m done adulting for the week
429 2018-02-03 22:56:56 Got happy cause I thought I found a bottle of wine in my pantry but it was a big ass bottle of cooking oil lol

435 2018-02-03 22:55:04 Nope. Natural gas is what’s driving down the price of oil.

And solar still needs natural gas (or something else, but usually gas in the US) for backup generation when the sun’s not shining.
436 2018-02-03 22:55:04 I always prove you wrong. You act like you know my life. Just cause your in the oil field you still ain’t shit

You better start your changes like BP and shell if you don't want to end up like Kodak.

441 2018-02-03 22:53:56 Bombast like Trudeau's always gives the other guy the edge. His position is eroding as he speaks. His big "chips" (oil and mfg. are gone)
442 2018-02-03 22:53:48 Bank bailouts. Hinckley point. Trident. Oil subsidy. Rail subsidy. Royal family. HS2. Carillion. Capita. Afghanistan. Iraq. Libya. Syria. There's a few trillion. Wanna keep going?
443 2018-02-03 22:53:40 You literally know nothing about Kinder Morgan. They have had 81 oil spills since 1961, and recovered less than 40 percent of that oil.
444 2018-02-03 22:53:32 Oil plays big in exports. As a percentage of GDP not so much.
445 2018-02-03 22:53:24 On Monday I'm giving in and trying to make essential oil blends! I'm so excited to go to the next level of witchy aesthetic~ 
446 2018-02-03 22:53:19 Truffle oil is life
447 2018-02-03 22:53:01 Having flu for a week has been the worst! Thank goodness for @AkinBeautyUK rosehip oil, @NetflixUK and the best curry from Massala in Stokey.
448 2018-02-03 22:52:53 Steak, shrimp, broccoli and a light pasta tossed in olive oil, garlic and Parmesan cheese. 
449 2018-02-03 22:52:51 Going get my oil changed so late

453 2018-02-03 22:52:25 kiehls midnight recover oil saved my life
454 2018-02-03 22:51:53 Cool how fun growing stuff can be huh. Basil pesto is easy, tasty and lasts. Just need olive oil, pine nuts and Parmesan
455 2018-02-03 22:51:44 Trump is OWNED by Big Oil
456 2018-02-03 22:51:36 Here’s the dish: there’s no truffle in truffle oil. Even Martha objects. #synthetic #unpleasant
457 2018-02-03 22:51:28 Show me a country without massive debts. Oil price up, production costs halved. Huge finds. Not much England can do that Scotland can’t but without ATMs, chip&pin, tyres & tarmac as a simple example, you’d not be able to buy a tv & our peat bogs are 30% size of Amazon-no whisky
458 2018-02-03 22:51:24 More snake oil
459 2018-02-03 22:51:15 James 5:14 
 Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in The Name of The LORD:
I Praise The LORD CHRIST 
I Praise The LORD
460 2018-02-03 22:51:14 Why would I when I get the hook up, premium oil and free new tires at once? Didn’t you try to do an oil change and Fuck your parents drive way up?
461 2018-02-03 22:50:48 Try tea tree oil but if it doesn't work then #idktho
462 2018-02-03 22:50:48 Shopping at Canadian Tire

463 2018-02-03 22:50:14 So excited on route! Party time 
464 2018-02-03 22:50:14 Has he read any of the back story of Carter Page, he was consorting with known Russian agents, handed over low level documents to them, speaking in Moscow for money against US sanction and tryin to negotiate some dodgy oil deals...he is precisely what FISA was set up for...
465 2018-02-03 22:50:13 May is just like Trump for 2 reasons, they both play to their base regardless of the impact to others and because they were both born in the USA they put America 1st. The USA wins if the pipeline is canceled, they will continue to get our oil at a discount. Coincidence???
466 2018-02-03 22:50:04 I put peppermint oil in my shampoo today and it was life changing.
467 2018-02-03 22:50:04 You don’t even change your own oil
468 2018-02-03 22:49:55 You caught a magic snake?.... AWESOME! I've been looking for one. I got this rash that i need some oil for. Our local one has moved on.
469 2018-02-03 22:49:51 South texas silica dust billows behind the car as I slide it around one more dirt road curve, sage fills the air, oil derrick generators breaking through the grasshopper’s song as a dry wind blows across brush covered land.........#home
470 2018-02-03 22:49:41 As a Russian BOT, I want Putin impeached! How dare he let Trump rebuild the American economy, military and export oil to Poland who we had under our control???

472 2018-02-03 22:49:34 Thank you   keep oil out
473 2018-02-03 22:49:31 I gotta get some beeswax first. And decide what kind of oil I wanna use 
474 2018-02-03 22:49:09 but i dont have any olive oil
475 2018-02-03 22:49:03 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
476 2018-02-03 22:49:01 They didn't have cameras before the Civil War, so ... oil paintings! By, DaVinci!
477 2018-02-03 22:48:56 With the help of billions of dollars of oil money
478 2018-02-03 22:48:50 Coconut oil just sorts everything out 
479 2018-02-03 22:48:42 Please protect our coast line and get our oil thru kinder Morgan to market. Thank you. Great job!
480 2018-02-03 22:48:18 I get that those are bar stools but all I see are Mercedes hood ornaments emitting fountains of oil.
481 2018-02-03 22:48:07 As a victim of Fibromyalgia I can sympathize with #lady gaga fibromyalgia and what she is going-through. I was diagnosed at 35 and now I’m 60. All I can say to her is stand strong, listen to you body and not the hype. There are a lot of snake oil doctors out there.
482 2018-02-03 22:48:05 @NaomiAKlein 
Nope !

Today, Russian LNG is being unloaded in Boston. If a new pipeline was built, this could have been Pennsylvania natural gas with half the GHG emissions.

If all the oil burned to generate electricity in New England was replaced with NG > half the emissions !
483 2018-02-03 22:48:02 oil on water will stay on my list as 'the most beautiful bastille song'
484 2018-02-03 22:48:00 It depends, usually a glass pipe/oil pen since we lost the bongs lol.
485 2018-02-03 22:47:44 Feels good to wash, oil and set your hair.. #hairtherapy
486 2018-02-03 22:47:18 Even my check went up 25 bucks and I get paid once a month. 25x12   300 bucks a year. My insurance went up 50 bucks a month and gas has gone up 50 cents a gallon since Christmas so big oil can make more profits.
487 2018-02-03 22:47:17 Someone can help you light your lamp but the oil must be your own.
488 2018-02-03 22:47:17 I never really believed in using oil to combat oily skin until I added this to my night time routine. Complete game changer
489 2018-02-03 22:47:13 Im also cooking with hot oil, this is not safe, kids dont try this at home or anywhere else.
490 2018-02-03 22:47:03 One good thing from it was it forced me to learn to make oil and candy and now make 150, 5 mg lozenges for $19. To buy them would be something like $600. Crazy rip off!!!
491 2018-02-03 22:46:41 Diet was going really well... until I accidentally poured a little too much oil into the pan. Needles to say four chicken fillets and two deep fried mars bars later I am comatosed.
492 2018-02-03 22:46:31 Alhamdulillah...
493 2018-02-03 22:46:16 Coconut oil! It makes them easier to slide in the trash can.
494 2018-02-03 22:46:10 Life update: I had the hiccups and my friend who was on the phone with me told me to use a peppermint essential oil on my thumb and hold it to the roof of my mouth. I tried it. IT WORKED. Thanks for stopping by.
495 2018-02-03 22:45:53 Who has experience with CBD oil?
496 2018-02-03 22:45:05 Anytime brother, get that oil hot!
497 2018-02-03 22:44:29 The point is... This Alberta oil is the dirtiest, lowest quality crude on the planet. AB. meet 2018.
498 2018-02-03 22:43:45 Ugh I gotta try Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner on the girls hair because this so called “Organics olive oil” shit not working out 
499 2018-02-03 22:43:44 @JustinTrudeau don’t build the #oil pipeline through the heart of Forrest fire country.. consider longer routes instead of driving it into the heart of the metropolitan area. #legacy
500 2018-02-03 22:43:33 Oil is not an ideal fuel. But at some point folks in northern latitudes are gonna have to import energy.
501 2018-02-03 22:43:24 Now you're cooking with oil!
502 2018-02-03 22:43:22 The flu is dangerous and selling snake oil doesn't help.
503 2018-02-03 22:43:07 Isn't BJP also does opposite of what it says. FDI , Oil prices , Aadhar , MNREGA , development etc .
504 2018-02-03 22:43:04 Short answer = "Nothing". They were involved in ensuring Fiona Wilson was detained to avoid reputation damage to #ALP & #Santos Govt approved #Santos sale of leaking wells & oil damaged aquifer which was ongoing at time Wilson was exposing them on facebook. #Qld #CSG #Fracking
505 2018-02-03 22:42:52 Also remember oil was sold at 200 (estimated)under Gej now is 90 (estimated) under PMB
506 2018-02-03 22:42:52 Splashed a drop of 350 degree fucking cooking oil in my eye because it's the Saturday before super bowl
507 2018-02-03 22:42:46 Erin’s dad changed my oil AND put gas in my car while we were out, the father I’ve always needed :’)
508 2018-02-03 22:42:45 What is one thing you could change about yourself? Other than the ogx argon oil conditioner what is your all time favorite hair product?
509 2018-02-03 22:42:44 pepperoni and sausage pizza with a second crust on top. Then olive oil and provolone put on top of that
510 2018-02-03 22:42:31 Glad to see you are using only excellent products. Olive oil imported by my good friend @fran260926 . Enjoy the game. Go Pats!
511 2018-02-03 22:42:20 Deforestation, displacement of local people, noxious, potentially cancerous - there is nothing good about palm oil.
512 2018-02-03 22:41:58 Coal , Gas, Oil promotion is stifling Progress , the Future is Clean Green Energy , Catch up the world will leave without  U. S.
513 2018-02-03 22:41:55 Actually, it was because the Union tried to make its economy prosper with only firearms. This caused a economic crash, and famine.
Same happening with Venezuela. Just replace the word firearms with oil.
514 2018-02-03 22:41:32 Chicken sausage with ginger and sage, arugula and avocado salad with pistachio oil and yuzu, mashed potatoes, last of the SA Shiraz.
515 2018-02-03 22:41:07 Frizzy hair? Coconut oil. No shaving cream? Coconut oil. Dry skin? Coconut oil. Bad grades? Coconut oil. Significant other acting up? Coconut oil. Stressful week? Coconut oil.
516 2018-02-03 22:40:57 What is the best site to buy CBD oil? I’m looking for effective but reasonably priced
517 2018-02-03 22:40:30 don't look up saudi arabia oil daddy PS4s
518 2018-02-03 22:40:12 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。
519 2018-02-03 22:40:11 The deli guy put olive oil in my Honey turkey & Muenster cheese sandwich and I can never eat one without it again
520 2018-02-03 22:40:11 Coney dog? Little Caesars? Motor oil? I suppose it could be cherries or apples. #puremichigan
521 2018-02-03 22:39:49 “Judicial Watch/Tom Fitton” you need to own the fact that you AREN’T OBJECTIVE and that your mission is to to spew hate, misleading and untruthful biased information against Hillary and @TheDemocrats through funds provided by the KOCH OIL INDUSTRY. Stop misleading people.
#OwnIt
522 2018-02-03 22:39:42 Palm Oil! It always comes down to Palm Oil.  I feel guilty for all the times I bought Girl Scout cookies, but I heard they got rid of it, do you know if that’s true?
523 2018-02-03 22:39:38 The provinces of BC and QC apposed oil pipelines due to spill risks although these same ones had the largest recent spills causing environmental damage. BC mining pond failure and Montreal dumping raw sewage due to inadequate infrastructure funding. Living in glass houses!
524 2018-02-03 22:39:33 I didn't know the normal castor oil works. Thanx
525 2018-02-03 22:39:27 Pro tip: if you drink coffee with coconut oil in it, your lips will look super glossy, luscious, and ready for the day...
526 2018-02-03 22:39:06 プリキュアまで1時間きった
527 2018-02-03 22:38:58 Tip: put some eucalyptus oil at the bottom of your shower for a really good time.
528 2018-02-03 22:38:43 When you’re talking to someone and they are being so dry and and all you’re wondering is if you can apply some coconut oil to their crust ass attitude
529 2018-02-03 22:38:21 This New Year, I love to #win a Family bundle of Wiley’s Finest Wild Alaskan Fish Oil via @etspeaksfrom
530 2018-02-03 22:38:00 Even the guy that the unionists rely on to produce their graphs admits GERs figures do not represent an Indy Scotland. We were paying more into the kitty before oil was landed. We will keep all the money we make&not pay towards a lot we do now. Few have our resources& capability!
531 2018-02-03 22:37:56 How about have the old oil rig companies pay for the additional state gas tax for all the road & highway repair until it's not needed anymore?  #California #Legislature? Where the #accountants on what entity would be paying more?
532 2018-02-03 22:37:21 Big mood. My mom said, oil painting is easy I can draw this. But to be fair I've never seen my mom draw.
533 2018-02-03 22:37:09 Good call with the lavender oil, v soothing, thanks Emma 
534 2018-02-03 22:36:59 Oil Slick Shine
535 2018-02-03 22:36:50 Followed by 5 minutes of watching (on a crap Skype feed) a Cavan family running around their house looking for pink toys. Why you ask? To win 1,000 litres of home heating oil. They should play reruns of this in Guantanamo.
536 2018-02-03 22:36:37 Put some tea tree oil on a hot wash cloth and lay it on your chest. It’ll open your nose right up.
537 2018-02-03 22:36:35 Here is a timely reminder that not only is palm oil very bad for the environment, it's also bad for your arteries. Just look at that. It's every bit as gross as lard and yet the food industry is embracing the stuff. Its everywhere.
538 2018-02-03 22:36:35 sometimes there's people around you that are having their own story, and you don't have to be part of it. You are allowed to remove yourself from their orbit.
539 2018-02-03 22:36:28 The height of sophistication at the time. The Vesta chow mein had the crispy things that miraculously appeared in the pan of hot oil.
540 2018-02-03 22:36:18 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
541 2018-02-03 22:36:00 Brb, investing in baby oil stock.
542 2018-02-03 22:35:34 Albeit anyone who travelled to Russia would come under surveillance it’s not problematic that as a globalist in the oil industry to meet with Gazprom and so many others because Russia is a major oil player and many business people travelled there
543 2018-02-03 22:35:32 #raydarcyshow Crisps last night on the #latelate . Oil for Sheila tonight(even though the house runs on gas)  And multi vitamins for the audience. Dear Jesus. Lucky lucky b******s
544 2018-02-03 22:35:17 Thank you Daphne. I did not mean smoking the weed. 
I believe that they are using Marijuana Oil for Epilepsy.
The side effects of the pills I use are dreadful.
But even the oil is illegal in the UK I hear.
545 2018-02-03 22:35:05 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this February? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.
546 2018-02-03 22:34:57 Lmao girl strippers here don’t make but 800 a night we gotta go to midland with the oil field men  they the ones with the money
547 2018-02-03 22:34:47 Y'all this Moroccan oil smells like a the guys from mx

549 2018-02-03 22:34:40 What’s a good smelling essential oil for a diffuser
550 2018-02-03 22:34:15 #raydarcy....ah now ray.....OIL..!!!.???
551 2018-02-03 22:34:12 Well not the "only" and "beneficiaries" [is what you meant to say] because certain political cliques and participants in certain other industries eg solar panels and wind turbines also would benefit from traditional oil and gas plus coal being capriciously shut down prematurely
552 2018-02-03 22:34:09 Shut down the existing flow of oil to BC refineries. It will come to this sooner than later. Might as well be sooner.
553 2018-02-03 22:33:54 $50 for a oil change 
554 2018-02-03 22:33:52 Stop trying to make us believe your lies and evolve! Quit using palm oil!!! YOU need to get “the facts”! #ShameOnYou #greed #profitoverconscience
555 2018-02-03 22:33:37 It's quite simple peeps. You don't eat meat (incld fish), oil, dairy or drink alcohol during the week days. At the weekends you can drink but stay veggie. Go to Church a lot. Read the Fathers. Simples...
556 2018-02-03 22:33:28 Israel blamed Iran for firing rocket's at Yemen. Yeh right!! What about the cue 1953. Operation Ajax, when Iran wanted to nationalise their oil. The west didn't like and intervened, so the CIA intervened
557 2018-02-03 22:33:06 Loool Kim Kardashian’s makeup artist was on this Alb show and the interviewer asked him what is one thing that you have accomplished, that your dad is most proud of? How could he reply with “slathering oil on Kim Kardashian’s ass” lmaoo
558 2018-02-03 22:32:03 5-15 Mins. Brows, Liner (if I feel like it), mascara, and usually a bold lip color just some sparkly lip gloss + oil. Also sometimes include a little black heart on my cheek if I’m feeling some Marina and the Diamonds vibes (which happens more often than you’d think haha.)
559 2018-02-03 22:31:54 Sometimes you gotta let your face breathe every so often. Putting oils and other soaps on your face isn’t natural, most oils can improve skin and some soaps do, but on the weekends, or every other day just use moisturizer or plain water instead of cleaning adding oil to it.
560 2018-02-03 22:31:45 Kate, oil demand is increasing every year. Obstructing Canada’s Gay friendly off shores emission to regimes with zero enviro standards also enriches dictators in regimes that throw  off buildings. How many  are you ok with being killed?
561 2018-02-03 22:31:26 Always. Jamaican castor oil
562 2018-02-03 22:31:10 Where is the spider hole he's been hiding in anyway?

567 2018-02-03 22:30:52 They are proclaiming to be such great Americans they have zero concern with Russia meddling. Take your dog and pony show and try selling your snake oil somewhere else. One thing is correct this Administration is transparent. We can see right through your lies
568 2018-02-03 22:30:47 Not good, the only thing that works (and believe me I’m an expert!) is dabbing Clove Oil on it OR sitting half a paracetamol on it and just let it soak in - don’t crunch it x
569 2018-02-03 22:30:42 Certain components of the essential oil of bergamot are antibiotic and disinfectant in nature. They inhibit the growth of germs, virus, and fungi. They also effectively prohibit infections, including those of the skin.
570 2018-02-03 22:30:38 The guy doing my oil change asked about my area code so I tell him I’m from temple and he goes “ohhhhhhhh you’re from trouble town!!!!” 
571 2018-02-03 22:30:35 Who keeps tightening the fuck out of my oil filters? I'm getting pretty tired of killing my hands trying to get these things out.

577 2018-02-03 22:29:35 I have 1 of those robots, she never has a headache, but you do need to add 6 quarts of oil weekly because her FUN SPOT gets a little squeaky
578 2018-02-03 22:28:46 put lavender essential oil in my diffuser and i slept for 5 hours and had dreams that i was a p.e. coach, best sleep of my life

584 2018-02-03 22:27:28 70 kr för en neck oil på idlewilde. Samma öl för 3-5 månader sen kostade 50 spänn. Nu går det bra och då kan man höja priserna. tråkigt!
585 2018-02-03 22:27:27 Last week when the photographer was oiling me up I was so horny. Like wow it feels good to have a man even rub oil on my arm shiiiit!

588 2018-02-03 22:27:11 So you would rather to held under the trumb of the Arabs.  Back to the days of gas rationing. MAGA & Make America Oil Independent
589 2018-02-03 22:27:06 I’ve had jury duty twice and can we talk about how weird it is that judges have an OIL PAINTING OF THEMSELVES behind them in the courtroom!?!  Is this normal?
590 2018-02-03 22:26:55 I bet Dems & msm “investigative journalists” are burning the midnight oil to have FISA application & warrant released to discredit the #Memo.....not!!! @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @CNN @nbc @ABC @CBS @MSNBC
591 2018-02-03 22:26:36 YES. Also i don’t want to hear anyone talk about ‘ethical leather’ which is oil mined from the earth at great human, animal and environmental cost. And then some of those people get mad at me for wearing wool??
592 2018-02-03 22:26:25 Argan oil is expensive af but it's liquid gold. It works for everything.
Skin, hair, nails, low account balance. 
Name it.
593 2018-02-03 22:26:10 A daily thing. Every crime by an illegal is preventable. Yes Americans comitt crimes, stuck with them. Illegals different, shouldn't be here
594 2018-02-03 22:26:05 Oil pulling feels so strange
595 2018-02-03 22:26:03 220m was his buy out and PSG is an oil rig, so thats why he went for so much. imo only maybe 150 at max. 
And in terms of ceiling, They arent youngsters. Theyve hit their potentials really and show it every day. Only Kane has some room left, hes 3 years younger than Hazard
596 2018-02-03 22:25:37 Baby oil rub ya down in baby oil
597 2018-02-03 22:25:36 And it hit the net.

602 2018-02-03 22:24:23 I need to sit in a vat of oil like C-3PO.
603 2018-02-03 22:24:22 I’m moving and making medicated coconut oil at the same time. Skizzilz
604 2018-02-03 22:24:07 How are you fighting climate change? Stopped driving? Flying? Heating your home? No? That would be too inconvenient eh. Easier to attack the oil industry instead of reducing your own reliance on it.
605 2018-02-03 22:24:07 I really hope these lemon, rosemary, peppermint and tea tree oil drop in my oil diffuser really help clear my nasal passages
606 2018-02-03 22:23:55 Quick response by the Oilers. Nice tip by Hatch. 2-1.
607 2018-02-03 22:23:55 Gotta laugh at this one. Some think Canada should invest money in fossil fuel energy biz so . . . profitable oil companies can be subsidized? Seriously? Bet they think they're conservatives, too. 
608 2018-02-03 22:23:52 MALIAR Turnbullshit has become our snake oil salesman. What a slime. 

#MalcolmTurnbull
609 2018-02-03 22:23:51 They won't. They are bought off.  Its so clear. they are so blatant. They got their tax cuts for Corp, banks and Oil so now they will come after more social programs for us like Social Security before they lose control of congress in Nov. #Taxdayboycott #Itsourmoney #FBR
610 2018-02-03 22:23:40 finally bought oil for my lashes again... pls let them grow fast

616 2018-02-03 22:23:17 Worrying about pipelines leaking oil instead of fixing roads and bridges. Unbelievable
617 2018-02-03 22:23:17 1 I have worked in steel and Oil & Gas industries where a ‘no blame’ culture is the norm. It takes years to establish, minutes to destroy
618 2018-02-03 22:22:59 Nicola she has lived for 2 years after her first lot of treatment well well . Cannibas  oil is the only way to go no sickness or loosing hair .
619 2018-02-03 22:22:46 At time mark 10:10, Nunes LEAKED information in the Steele dossier about Carter Paige being offered 19M worth of a Russian Oil company. What a idiot!
620 2018-02-03 22:22:27 My roommate came home while I was struggling with my oil change and we commiserated on doing stuff like this mostly to spite every person who says "you don't look like someone who could do X".
621 2018-02-03 22:22:18 Some of his brushes come with photoshop but I haven't explored them much beyond his HB pencil! Did you buy the oil brushes?

625 2018-02-03 22:22:07 Beds are burning de Midnight Oil es una de las mejores canciones de la vida! INXS me encanta! Los vi aquí poco antes de que Hutchence se fuera. Demasiado!
626 2018-02-03 22:21:56 Believe me, don't trust polls. Oh, 1 poll shows that less than half the country approves of my russia conspiracy, treason, espionage. I believe in polls now and the stock market isn't on me anymore. GFY, snake oil sleazebucket!
627 2018-02-03 22:21:52 I just bought a cool new shirt All tragedy is a farce! A farce...of farts! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Santa Claus is just Jesus in a colorful costume!
628 2018-02-03 22:21:50 You're right. Many people should be ashamed.  How about you start with yourself for abandoning P.R., not calling California a disaster area, not ensuring clean water in Flint, not acknowledging the oil spill, pulling safety protocols for miners. How about you be ashamed!?
629 2018-02-03 22:21:46 I couldn't agree more, a lot of people should be ashamed for voting for this snake oil salesman

632 2018-02-03 22:20:56 Can't take you seriously if you use coconut oil to moisturize your face tbh. 
You just have good skin/genes.
633 2018-02-03 22:20:51 Issue with Denis Healey was he lied , said inflation was 8% when it was more like 30%.  Issue in 1970's was rise in oil price.  Tories were in power then and got voted out because they had no answer.  Will admit though Labour were no better
634 2018-02-03 22:20:28 ooh :D have you tried Kyle Webster's oil brushes? :O They are so gud!
635 2018-02-03 22:20:26 Alaskans own 543,176 shares of ATHABASCA OIL CORP, worth $623,146. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
636 2018-02-03 22:20:23 Shell is a Dutch company is this a coincidence? Shell have used Irish military/Garda to do their dirty work on oil pipelines on west coast for years
637 2018-02-03 22:20:18 The ₦1.1 billion jihadist Buhari budgeted to clean the National Security Agency ’s office means that everyday ₦3.1 million Naira is spent cleaning the office!  Even oil spill don't cost that much to clean. #Nigeria Biafra want exit
638 2018-02-03 22:20:12 Toyota called me to remind me that my car is due for its freeservice check up/ oil change 
639 2018-02-03 22:19:56 Yep We'll give them all the oil they want
640 2018-02-03 22:19:55 My oil's changed, my taxes are dealt with, and just as I was getting ready to breathe a sigh of relief, my laptop battery is messed up and tech support isn't open on weekends. 
Oh well, at least my laptop works when it's plugged in so at least I have that for me...
641 2018-02-03 22:19:43 Olive oil hasn't been used in the production of catgut for over a century. (E8 Fromage)

644 2018-02-03 22:19:04 It's totally worth the price! Also, if you dislike paper with textur (many people do) then...this is the smoothest one I've ever seen, honestly. I'm still all :ooooooooo whenever I use it.
(my classmates even used it for OIL)
645 2018-02-03 22:18:41 Conspiracy theory of the day: Oil companies don't want you to know that water can more efficiently fuel your car.
646 2018-02-03 22:18:27 Lavender oil & sea salt  = Heaven 
647 2018-02-03 22:17:51 high key overwhelmed and about to start saying no to people... wish I could work on FFF full time because burning the midnight oil is getting exhausting.
648 2018-02-03 22:17:33 Coconut oil is MORE flamable. Thought I'd try using it in a wok. Caught on fire. Ran carrying out to the porch. 
Neighbors just stared. I just smiled. 
I was SO lucky the door was open.
649 2018-02-03 22:17:27 I knew i was getting screwed over last time i got an oil change. They put premium($76) in my car &didn’t tell me until i had to pay &said my car needs it. So i went to a different place this time & they said the car needs synthetic oil and asked BEFORE HAND if it was okay($24)
650 2018-02-03 22:17:19 Who got some cbd oil for me
651 2018-02-03 22:17:08 Men at work, midnight oil por los australianos, no me gustaba mucho Inxs pero bueno, hay mucha música vieja buena... lo sé porque leo e investigo, porque yo soy un carajito 
652 2018-02-03 22:17:07 The Earth is a living organism in it's own way. Anyone ever think of oil as the life blood of the land to keep the ground safe & strong for those things above? When it's taken away there are earthquakes. Hmm. Maybe we need to think differently. I'm thinking yes.   
653 2018-02-03 22:17:00 got my oil changed today, topped off my transmission fluid, if/when i get my power steering fixed i think my truck will be pretty much perfect
654 2018-02-03 22:16:55 I guess expectations that oil prices will move higher
655 2018-02-03 22:16:53 Just put some Shan Tikkah masala garlic, ginger, avacadoe oil and marinated the chicken lol. I can cook.
656 2018-02-03 22:16:47 Might find them in the form of cod liver oil! That works too. Good luck!
657 2018-02-03 22:16:34 Bike 'oil' for the chain, it doesn't stay on as long as standard oil, but doesnt attract as much muck.
658 2018-02-03 22:16:31 Lucas oil racing on tv
659 2018-02-03 22:16:19 I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil
660 2018-02-03 22:16:17 Norway gets about 95% of its energy from hydro and drills in the seas for oil to sell abroad. It seriously isn't as forward thinking as most believe.
661 2018-02-03 22:16:14 I was accused of being a snake oil salesman at the start of out GBL work. Only concern I had was about getting snake oil on the Nintendo DS as it would have invalidated the warranty.

664 2018-02-03 22:15:50 Mehhhh, I hate being dirty.  I once had my oil changed by a woman, so...  RT @Hurt_Angle: That and taking out the trash. And finally any type of yard work/ handyman /automotive shit. Rest of that shit she Rosie The Riveter
665 2018-02-03 22:15:35 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
666 2018-02-03 22:15:28 Matt is teaching me how to change the oil in his truck and I’m having a blast lol
667 2018-02-03 22:15:19 Also, when it comes to using oil for recipes try sticking to extra virgin olive oil. Definitely keeps you satiated. There are a bunch of online calorie counters and macro counters for you to use if you need help with specifics, but I would suggest getting info about your BMIfirst
668 2018-02-03 22:15:12 LOL! With oil that leaks all over the street and causes a stain on the asphalt! Hate that!!!
669 2018-02-03 22:15:10 YES! we do. And we can't wait for Congress to give it back to us cuz most of them are bought off by the corporations!  We are in a mess but we CAN do it if we UNITE. Take our money away from the Corporations, Big Banks and Big Oil #Taxdayboycott #Itsourmoney #FBR
670 2018-02-03 22:14:53 Was he eyeballing places to drill for oil?
671 2018-02-03 22:14:43 Just soft yellow corn tortillas, fried up in some olive oil
672 2018-02-03 22:14:37 You can brush the loaf with olive oil or spritz it with water (for a crunchier crust) but the high heat should be enough to brown it. You should give it another go- to hell with the bread maker. 
673 2018-02-03 22:14:22 “PMO doesn’t want oil to reach tidewater”, “sock puppet”, those aren’t opinions, just parts of an infantile rant. How do u explain the fact that, with a long nose, Harper claimed to b pro-oil but got nothing to tidewater? Let’s have it. And nice try on the bigotry thing. #cdnpoli

675 2018-02-03 22:13:48 Sadly, agitators for “restructuring”, in Nigeria, whatever that means, have their eyes primarily on oil. Our most valuable natural resource is our talented & youthful population. As our Govt continues to create the enabling environment, watch out for rapid growth & development!
676 2018-02-03 22:13:45 Thanks, man! Imma get my hands on some fish oil pills then
677 2018-02-03 22:13:32 I love a good roasted beet drizzled with olive oil. A dadh of salt and pepper and fresh rosemary. Yum!
678 2018-02-03 22:13:24 Ha! Cool! Not sure if I should buy more oil tubes or what.. Are you enjoying oils? I remember they took an age to dry?
679 2018-02-03 22:13:23 @debbieflint I'm 70 which is better for me the cleansing oil or cleansing balm, my skin is slightly dry.

But sure, your way is better...
683 2018-02-03 22:12:39 I rubbed lavender oil on my hot water bottle. Best decision I’ve made today. 
684 2018-02-03 22:12:32 Hot oil splashed in my eye while cooking  today is great
685 2018-02-03 22:12:22 He was having another female for the oil change, n some men are like that scared to say what is on his mind
686 2018-02-03 22:12:22 Take some fish oil pills, your body probably has too much omega 6 and might be the reason you feel hung over. You need omega 3
687 2018-02-03 22:12:19 Just asked for oil control Head and Shoulders shampoo at Sprouts and they poured pigs blood on me!!!
688 2018-02-03 22:12:02 I have a vitamin c serum question. For those of you that do use those, who are your faves? Is it oil based or water based?

695 2018-02-03 22:10:12 While I was going to school in SantaBarbara 1969 and later, We had the most horrible oil spill. So much lose of sea and bird life. Hurt tourism and took years to clean up. Insane. We need to wake up, if we want our grandchildren to have a clean and healthy environment.

702 2018-02-03 22:09:02 It worked out this time, everything they tell you about oil fires is real.

706 2018-02-03 22:08:27 Getting an oil change praying it don’t take all day
707 2018-02-03 22:08:27 Page was an oil exec, and santions relief means Russian oil can start flowing again. Putin & kleptokrats r desperate to get oil flowing again. Before latest Obama sanctions, Exxon inked half TRILLION $$ deal to develop Rus arctic oil. It's all about oil.
708 2018-02-03 22:08:17 I can feel your healing oil, running down my brow. I wouldn’t trade another lifetime for how I feel right now. You’re the miracle worker, Jesus!

710 2018-02-03 22:08:12 Seems like a good starting point. High safety standards, set limits, investments in enviornmental enhancements to support fishing, coastal, and wildlife interest should be required of any company partnering with our state to drill. Thanks for standing up to big oil $$$
711 2018-02-03 22:07:41 Peppermint oil does not mix well with cheese puffs... doesn’t taste right. 
712 2018-02-03 22:07:33 I ask them to get fish oil through food. 2 servings per week.   
713 2018-02-03 22:07:22 Lebanon's Ad-Diyar paper claims Putin has okayed the sales of 500 MiG-31 and MiG-35 jet fighters to Iran in return for a daily transfer of 10 million barrels of oil. It says thousands of Iranian pilots will go to Russia to spend a 3-year training course for MiG-35
714 2018-02-03 22:07:17 I find it works best if I prioritise my needs, and then make the best choice available out of what’s left. So, for eg, if I’m buying crackers I’ll look for the higher fibre/lower sodium ones, and then, if there’s more than one sort that’s ok, consider palm oil, packaging etc.
715 2018-02-03 22:07:07 They were standing on oil drums then jumped down I think ! Ma mama were all crazy now 
716 2018-02-03 22:07:05   eh mana
717 2018-02-03 22:06:53 Pollution from big companies, fracking, deep sea drilling, oil spills, human hideousness,greed and corporations using the ocean like a giant dump, now more so that #Trumps have sold off all American water/land to all deep sea drilling fracking and mining?
718 2018-02-03 22:06:52 I have heard coconut oil and bicarb can be a good substitute with some essential oil added. I'm still using up old stock!

722 2018-02-03 22:06:29 Just get dome practice in for when the bread queues hit. We will have our independence and take our oil with us. England has FA resources so good luck with the welfare bill.
723 2018-02-03 22:06:16 Has AB thought about refusing to export oil?  That'd really show 'em!
724 2018-02-03 22:05:53 No1 should notice it’s been Russians & the GOP since 2014 (likely b4)when Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, Giuliani, Peters, F. Graham publicly saluted Putin 4 his “moral” “decisive” leadership over their own President. The year oil spiked. Bad 4 Alaskan, Texas, Russian oil economies
725 2018-02-03 22:05:30 Good Year takes an hour though for oil changes definitely will keep this in mind next time and go shopping or something

728 2018-02-03 22:05:20 I do 1/3 c oil, 1/3 c applesauce and a VeganEgg. I hate cakey ones so was unsure of the applesauce & avoid milk on principal bc it usually gives me cakey ones ... but the avo sounds amazing. I'm too disastery to keep avos on hand as often as I make brownies, tho.

732 2018-02-03 22:04:19 I think you guys all entered into a Abuse Ecosystem, women too force others under the bus being opportunistic or avoiding isolation. Some care now but sacrificed others in the past. 
I guess something questionable similar to a whole snake oil community exists & not only sexual
733 2018-02-03 22:04:18 Listen to yourself.  A dude met with a Russian oil guy.  A international businessman has business relationships.  I shoot Russian ammo.  It's cheaper.  Is that grounds to investigate me?

753 2018-02-03 22:00:41 This happens to me every time! I have acne prone skin also. I wipe the area with coconut oil when we are done waxing, Then wash my face. It doesn’t work 100% of the time but majority it helps prevent breakouts.
754 2018-02-03 22:00:39 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this February? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.

759 2018-02-03 22:00:05 Horses. What's wrong with using horses? Think of all of the jobs it would create. And it would be totally green. No oil. No gas. No coal. Only emission is horse darts. Poop would serve obviously as compost fertilizer. Families would stay closer together...
760 2018-02-03 22:00:04 #45 – his brilliant idea of MAGA:
Oil, gas, uranium and coal companies can make requests or stake claims to land cut from two Utah national monuments by President Trump. The  rape of America’s national monuments and parks begins. Go see them while you  can.
761 2018-02-03 21:59:50 @pink Im not kidding my flu was better and shorter just by taking a tbs of coconut oil and a drop of Thieves essential oil everyday for 5 days... U go girl and make us all proud tomorrow as always!

763 2018-02-03 21:59:04 One medium California Avocado has about 20 grams of mostly healthy fat (similar composition as olive oil) and about 228 calories.. Lots of delicious recipies.
764 2018-02-03 21:58:58 Rosario, I can assure you there will still be T-Mobile vehicles utilizing oil and gas in 2021!!
If not they will use electric plug ins. Where do you think that power comes from?  Research it, I think you’ll be disappointed!!
765 2018-02-03 21:58:56 When you slapped some avocado oil on your skin and realise how dehydrated u were. Wtf

#GodsPlan stop complaining
769 2018-02-03 21:58:06 Money is the most powerful cure-all in the world. 
Coconut oil, a close second.
770 2018-02-03 21:57:56 @ChosenFoods your avocado oil bottle would not open for me. Pretty frustrating

773 2018-02-03 21:57:27 I usually use pretzels and fry it so I’m just wondering if I do everything the same minus all the oil if it’ll still be good? Chicken can be so dry
774 2018-02-03 21:57:19 I’m on youtube having my mind blown. Do you use the fresh herb or the essential oil? I’m ready to have my diffuser lit.
775 2018-02-03 21:57:06 Eyyah. Ok. I will ask him about you.
776 2018-02-03 21:57:02 Worst oil? Pretty sure many in Louisiana might disagree with you and if we kept politics out of it we wouldn't even be having this discussion.
777 2018-02-03 21:56:52 What he's saying is we should teach the oil riggers to be astronauts instead of vice versa.
778 2018-02-03 21:56:42 Very nice new Honda lawn mower that has never on purpose mowed grass. I bought it from a store that originally sold it to the new owner that person put the oil that comes with new mowers into the gas tank. Call Jack (859-391-7900)runs as it is brand new!!
779 2018-02-03 21:56:30 I use an avocado along with the soymilk and oil in mine, cutting the oil in half. The avocado trick is amazing, it even gives you that crispy top

793 2018-02-03 21:53:49 Try RSO, also known as Rick Simpson Oil, a concentrated marijuana oil which has cured people from stage 4 cancer. The greedy people at Big Pharma don’t want anyone to know about it. They want to make a huge amount of money from chemo that often makes people worse.
794 2018-02-03 21:53:47 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
795 2018-02-03 21:53:27 Oil is renewable, it just takes a little longer.

798 2018-02-03 21:53:15 I did but Nunes hasn’t seen the Intel because he doesn’t have clearance and was recused. So every ic both foreign and domestic are making this up? Didn’t Russia just give NK oil?
799 2018-02-03 21:53:14 So far no military personnel, Christian, Catholic, Italian, Greek, First Nation, Oil & Gas worker, any opposed to the carbon tax should ever vote for him. What’s left, Muslim, LGBTQ, people who like his hair. He should be gone in 2019

803 2018-02-03 21:52:17 Russian coercion . Not enforcing sanctions. Putin has something on him... & I think much of this shit concerns gas & oil w/ Russia & USA .. hence the blackout of climate change & high taxing of sustainable energy..gas,oil is all Russia has to export
804 2018-02-03 21:52:11 Might need to fill them with oil in a few weeks tho ............
805 2018-02-03 21:52:00 I just saw that if you poured too much foam into your beer that you can use the oil from your face to break down the foam. Why and also who bothered to figure that out.
806 2018-02-03 21:51:57 Exactly 
807 2018-02-03 21:51:55 Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

The Kremlin targeted educated youth and swing state voters during its cyber attacks in the 2016 campaign.

Trump maintains ties to rich businessmen from Azerbaijan
808 2018-02-03 21:51:52 Yeah, mine isn't getting any major repairs anymore. Oil, gas, and maybe brakes and tires.

819 2018-02-03 21:50:17 @ladyupsidedown one thing I really like about Heartland is the stereotype 'bad' characters turn out to be alright in the end. Like the oil guy and the prince. Anyway Amy has just about got over her kick in the head from a horse so let's see what happens next.
820 2018-02-03 21:50:08 Was looking all over my beard oil today and then I realized I gave it to @boogietmusic last night 
821 2018-02-03 21:50:05 “I do love chasing my main man in Hell around. Or locking him in the oven.”

Slides her arms around his waist. 

“How about a nice massage with lots of oil?”
822 2018-02-03 21:49:49 Change the oil before you leave if you haven’t done it recently and he can take it for a spin around the block once a month and it should be fine.
823 2018-02-03 21:49:40 The universe doesn't want me getting an oil change. So frustrating.
824 2018-02-03 21:49:31 He will not be happy until our air is black with coal dust our waters are polluted and every ocean view includes and oil drilling platform.
825 2018-02-03 21:49:21 delicious palm oil though
826 2018-02-03 21:49:00 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
827 2018-02-03 21:48:46 The hangover of this muti-decade boondoggle will be when the oil companies finally collapse and leave you with a massive toxic mess to clean up.  Do some research on the # of wells abandoned or marginal.  Someone needs to clean that up.
828 2018-02-03 21:48:42 note to self :  noodles soaked in soy sauce with a crap tonne of seasoning and seasame oil with a fried egg on top is an A++++ meal to have for dinner
829 2018-02-03 21:48:21 The whole reason I brought a book was to read said book while getting an oil change....what do I do....leave in the front seat. Heeeeeey Twitter, wassup? 
830 2018-02-03 21:48:18 TURKANA OIL ...

Uhuru wants: 45% go to Kenyatta family, 50% go to USA, and 5% to local government.

Raila wants: 35% to local government, 65% to National government.
831 2018-02-03 21:48:14 We thought e knew @JustinTrudeau but didn't know he was big oil and gas supporter, did not know that when he said "communities should decide" that he really meant communities should decide only if they agreed with his  agenda
832 2018-02-03 21:47:57 Come over after so we can change the oil in our cars and do our taxes
833 2018-02-03 21:47:40 Tom is in the pocket of big oil big timber and doesn't give a shit about us. Sell our resources for cheap.  He's not hill country, he's flatlander slime.

839 2018-02-03 21:46:34 so I go to get my oil changed and they come out with an estimated $700 in repairs needed and I’m like  bitch, I CAME FOR AN OIL CHANGE HOW THE HELLS THAT GONNA COST ME $700?!
840 2018-02-03 21:46:09 That's the main reason I didn't order it. I find frog fiddly AF to eat so I went for fish fillet in chili oil and mapo tofu instead.
841 2018-02-03 21:46:05 Palm oil
842 2018-02-03 21:46:00 I’ve heard that stress causes hair loss. Obviously, this snake oil salesman FAKE POTUS will be bald totally by the end of this year.
843 2018-02-03 21:45:58 Palm oil is never ok.
844 2018-02-03 21:45:51 Agree. Putin goals rhyme with Koch goals: Absolute control and $$. Methods also. As to RU economy failing: billions in assets have been stolen and taken out of country in addition to oil/gas price decline.
845 2018-02-03 21:45:43 Put baby oil or olive oil in his/her hair right away. Kills them by smothering.
846 2018-02-03 21:45:37 I wonder if that car has engine that's low to the ground, with an extra think oil pan to cut the wind from underneath it that gives it 30-40 more horsepower. I bet it's got a fuel line that will hold an extra gallon of gas.
847 2018-02-03 21:45:32 These fools think they will still own the oil once EU let them join .

They are totally deluded. EU negotiates memberships is to benefit them alone & Everything EU does is for benefit of France and Germany only, as they control EU being the richest member states in Eurozone.

851 2018-02-03 21:44:46 My federal tax goes to wars in the middle east and tax breaks for big oil.
It also may go to a freaking wall, that will be like all walls historically (if not heavy manned and even more expensive ) unless.
852 2018-02-03 21:44:44 Of course you'll take it. You don't have to wonder where you'll get the money for your next tank of oil.
853 2018-02-03 21:44:31 It means that they're pumping oil in those locations and venting the gas that sits above the oil. As they are unable to trap the gas into storage for export/domestic use, the only option is to burn it. In most situations, you'd want to sell that gas, but infrastructure costs much
854 2018-02-03 21:44:29 I just want to give you the longest hot oil massage 
855 2018-02-03 21:44:21 @SpeakerRyan is a snake oil salesman and a traitor to the United States.  Let that sink in.
856 2018-02-03 21:44:21 I´d put some of these ingredients in a pan with coconut oil, butter and meat.

858 2018-02-03 21:44:12 Well let see now some of our major car company's are working on that very subject and asking people to witch from gas powered cars to electric cars and many have all ready done so now when the oil runs out on day and it will those who have those cars will be walking.

861 2018-02-03 21:43:50 And they still won't understand Chris.... not enough oil in their mechanisms to understand simple logic.

865 2018-02-03 21:43:17 The appeal to buy a indian scout as a first bike is great until you get service done, @indianmotocycle my first oil change was over 400.00, they didn't even work for the full time they charged me for. Is the normal for the authorized dealerships to be this shady?

874 2018-02-03 21:42:16 I need an oil change! :P
875 2018-02-03 21:42:15 Rosehip oil is great as it has vitamin C and a small amount of a natural derivative of retinol.  I usually combine it with a good moisturizer as it's not very hydrating on its own.
876 2018-02-03 21:42:04 Niku pumulako zoona lol. Mwachinjako oil vija so
877 2018-02-03 21:42:03 Real Madrid should start building Refineries, they'll soon discover Crude Oil. They keep going down.
878 2018-02-03 21:41:54 hope he's ok.  get him some cbd oil, if its a reoccurring thing
879 2018-02-03 21:41:35 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
880 2018-02-03 21:41:32 The logic of building more pipeline to fight climate change consistently eludes me. I guess my PhD or common sense aren't on par with the snake oil reasoning of slick politicians.
881 2018-02-03 21:41:15 I agree, to a point. Over here, the mindset even amongst most proponents of transitioning to green energy is "don't make enemies out of people we're trying to help". And that means expanding existing oil trade to help fund the green initiatives and lessen the blow to our economy.
882 2018-02-03 21:41:10 This super cheap packet of flour, palm oil, and still the brand name Chikin Ramen. In bigger cities, your cooked noodles,
883 2018-02-03 21:40:53 FYI: The more we expand our oil sands with the highest respect for the environment and with green technology, our cutting edge technology will be adapted by other oil producers which is a win win for everyone. Oil keeps our country functioning.
884 2018-02-03 21:40:50 I can verify it. Two years in. I started with a brush. Then Beard wax. Then beard oil. Then beard shampoo..... I have passed out way too many $ to shave now.

886 2018-02-03 21:40:28 I would love for us to get out of the Middle East, stop buying Saudi oil, stop taking sides in sectarian battles. That all didn’t happen overnight & it won’t be stopped overnight.

896 2018-02-03 21:39:21 I like to put tea tree oil and ice it for redness and swelling. :)
897 2018-02-03 21:39:17 I've used their sunscreen (I love their spray sunscreen) but didn't realize they'd launched these essential oil products until this week. #shiftcon
898 2018-02-03 21:39:12 The way Real Madrid are going down they will soon discover crude oil
899 2018-02-03 21:38:52 Someone change the oil in my car 
900 2018-02-03 21:38:24 The one true RINO is this snake oil conman @realDonaldTrump, bastardizing the @GOP for his own benefit. I feel for lifelong fiscal Republicans who’ve seen their party hijacked & marauded by the likes of Citizens United, Koch, Mercers, etc. Sad.
901 2018-02-03 21:38:19 Dude!!  if they removed half the oil in those snacks they could start a whole new oil company.
902 2018-02-03 21:37:50 In OIL Miette is 6th!!
903 2018-02-03 21:37:50 Garlic and oil and grated Parmesan is the best
904 2018-02-03 21:37:45 I grew up in AB and I know your wounds are self inflicted.  While Norway built a trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund, you financed the tar sands with 1% royalty rates.  Essentially free oil.
905 2018-02-03 21:37:11 Sauté uses oil.
906 2018-02-03 21:37:07 I think I run out of coconut oil every month 
907 2018-02-03 21:36:59 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
908 2018-02-03 21:36:54 Hair! I have to say, it felt a bit dry when I was rinsing it out, but it was so nice once i dried it with the hair dryer and brushed it. (I did use some oil on my hair after, just because the ends need some extra loving)
909 2018-02-03 21:36:40 Erik won’t cook me bacon bc he’s scared of the oil splashing on him
910 2018-02-03 21:36:39 #BBNaija that's how someone said Miracle danced like crayfish inside hot oil
911 2018-02-03 21:36:33 I’ll be speaking shit out into existence and noooo nothing happens but when I laugh at a guy who caught his stove on fire cus he was scared of the oil it ends up happening to me literally two seconds later
912 2018-02-03 21:36:14 I’ve been wasting too much time recently I’m going to eliminate the middle man and just start drinking CBD oil
913 2018-02-03 21:36:09 Everyone saw your tweet about the teacher with the big 1.50 a week pay raise, do you realize gas and oil prices went up? Food costs more? What kind of sorcery do you do that would make anyone grateful for 1.50 a week extra?
914 2018-02-03 21:36:02 We could agree to disagree, but that would be intellectually dishonest. Citing Laffer is, in modern America with our low tax rates, selling snake oil.
915 2018-02-03 21:35:56 The best I can find is that Stalin made some very pig headed decisions, and lead to a country dependent on oil revenues. The same problem with Venezuela. A successful socialist state diversifies.

But that dosn't explain how china survived Mao.
916 2018-02-03 21:35:25 Soup, tea, movies and a coconut oil hair treatment to make me feel better on this shit day  this cold can fuck offffff 
917 2018-02-03 21:35:19 See ima just plead the 5th  its black history month the cocconut oil supply low
918 2018-02-03 21:34:49 I love getting that oil change my car be driving good af after 
919 2018-02-03 21:34:42 No oil, coated my chicken with mayo then rolled in panko bread crumbs and spices.
920 2018-02-03 21:34:16 If you can, get a jar of coconut oil! I have to wash my hands constantly as a chef + im in ceramics right now so they are like 4 times extra dry & that stuff is a life saver! I use it for my lips & hands & it works wonders! You can grab a jar at walmart for cheap too btw
921 2018-02-03 21:34:04 Instead of buying said chair I bought discounted olive oil at Cost Plus. This is adulthood.

923 2018-02-03 21:33:45 The Advanced Conservative Thinkers™ are easily manipulated by "true conservatism" and have so few allies left they must attach to anyone they think is intellectual. All that is left are hucksters and liars. "Hi fellow trucon! Muh Russia! Buy my book and snake oil pls"
924 2018-02-03 21:33:36 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

928 2018-02-03 21:33:18 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
929 2018-02-03 21:33:12 And somehow all the anti oilsands people don’t mind consuming oil tankered to Canada from South America & the Middle East or piped from the US. Educate yourselves people.
930 2018-02-03 21:33:02 My prediction .. average oil price at $65/bbl this year
931 2018-02-03 21:32:38 How am I meant to know a number? You just assume that all vegans use coconut oil, buy things with palm oil in them and eat quinoa when not all of them do. Meat eaters eat and use those things too.
932 2018-02-03 21:32:36 Puke oil plunges a bollard.
933 2018-02-03 21:32:29 They go into the middle east dig bare oil and yet petrol currently stands at 1.25 a litre that's what Zionism is,scamming you and letting  your family fight for the riches
934 2018-02-03 21:32:18 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
935 2018-02-03 21:32:11 yeahhh. i was wearing gloves and everything. the color remover and acetone helped fade it a little but i still look like i just got done changing someone’s oil haha.
936 2018-02-03 21:32:06 For extra points, ask Amber Rudd about the appointment of Nick Hurd as Policing Minister...

Just don't bring Child Abuse on behalf of the intelligence services, Le Cercle, or Al Yamamah oil for arms into the equation.

937 2018-02-03 21:32:03 I didn’t contradict him. He wants to open up new markets and get a world price for our fuels. California is a new market and once at tidewater the oil no longer has to be discounted like in Alberta. Certainly Asia is a ice market but California is closer 1/
938 2018-02-03 21:31:54 LMFAOOOOO AYO - I got her when I re up on the almond oil. Lil Tay could teach me sum she a G already
939 2018-02-03 21:31:53 @ErikSTownsend Great Oil Talk last, it is so insightful in terms how the oil market works from supply side( both crude and refinery products) perspective. The mainstream experts are so ignorant of the difference between heavy and light crude as well as the process of refinery.
940 2018-02-03 21:31:22 I also read from a Russian statement BTW Putin and his oligarchs that the 1st shipment of Russian oil was at the dock! That's coming from Putin in a statement when he was talking with his oligarchs! Why?? From Russia?
941 2018-02-03 21:31:09 iirc that's due to oil companies or something
942 2018-02-03 21:30:43 What about roads?  What about crumbling bridges?  How about something more useful than two pipelines that leak oil?
943 2018-02-03 21:30:39 Designated waste land: Trumplandia.  What is left after all the oil spills from pipelines and drilling, coal ash dumping etc.
944 2018-02-03 21:30:24 I’m really bad at painting with oil paint and it makes me sad
945 2018-02-03 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
946 2018-02-03 21:30:13 Also, when it takes decades and millions of dollars in court costs to get a friggin' pipeline built in this country, oil producers will pull out, move south and leave Canada with vast reserves of oil that we can't sell. Why do Canadians tolerate this madness?
947 2018-02-03 21:30:07 Oil & oil filters in both vehicles changed, truck washed... Enjoying my outdoor time today.
948 2018-02-03 21:30:05 There is always oil in the bearings.
949 2018-02-03 21:30:04 While you're underneath the truck can you change the oil?
950 2018-02-03 21:30:03 my car just hit it’s GLO up! new wash, new oil, full tank 
951 2018-02-03 21:29:54 Real question not banter. Does it feel hollow when you win trophies because its oil money and not self generated or does it not matter ?
952 2018-02-03 21:29:37 Fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me. Won't get fooled again... I now know better than to ever trust any Trudeau... A man is nothing without integrity and honesty. Justin has neither. Just a liar with good hair, bought by Big Oil.

956 2018-02-03 21:28:47 Everything from GST to WMDs, Work Choices to Wheat for Oil..etc etc etc..just a woefully dishonest and corrupt slimebag from tip to tail..as are the MSM scum who continually laud the mongrel dog..
957 2018-02-03 21:28:38 I have 5 glass houses and four polytunnels, I am too busy to be throwing stones. Your quinoa is fertilised by oil that wars have been fought over. Mono culture of any description kills animals, fact
958 2018-02-03 21:28:31 Pretty hard when you hate oil and gas.   Did she  endorse Harper to win so there'd be no carbon tax  ?
959 2018-02-03 21:28:14 I wonder if Nunes is excited about his name being mentioned in future history books as a Kremlin tool who tried to defend the Snake Oil Gang.
960 2018-02-03 21:28:08 But anyway, tautoko alllllllll of this. I eat a lot of rice noodles and coleslaw, which both comes in plastic. But I know which noodles don't have palm oil in them and we can recycle crushable plastics so I try to.
961 2018-02-03 21:28:07 idk if my hair growing from this oil I put on my scalp 3 days ago, but Jesus it’s itching like crazy
962 2018-02-03 21:28:07 Being a broke college student has taught me how to:
•change the oil, spark plugs, and fuses on my car.
•cut my own hair
•make some neat DIY gifts 
& 
•manage my money around ice cream
963 2018-02-03 21:28:03 Today I shopped for a shotgun and changed the oil in my car because I am an extremely manly man.

969 2018-02-03 21:26:19 I don't use coconut oil or buy things with palm oil in them. I use no oil at all, I fry things in water. You're forgetting all the harm agriculture has on the planet and land. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
970 2018-02-03 21:26:10 how much do the oil companies get? you really have messed up here
971 2018-02-03 21:25:55 coconut oil solves all my problems

974 2018-02-03 21:25:49 Oh then I'm glad Colt. I don't cook so often but if I do, it has to be perfect. *She twirled spaghetti around her fork as well, using the spoon to catch one scampi in the garlic oil. After eating it she nodded Approvingly, proud of what she had prepared*
Well, it's ok I'd say
975 2018-02-03 21:25:46 On the contrary getting the oil psus out of debt was a good move, no ?

985 2018-02-03 21:24:15 He knows dear, he just does not care! @harpe22 Is there oil in Afrin?
986 2018-02-03 21:24:15 Government and Religion mix like Oil and Water
987 2018-02-03 21:24:14 You are on to something: "buy advertising " idea. For ex., after the BP oil spill, BP spent most their money on advertising instead of the former way of paying attorneys etc
988 2018-02-03 21:23:47 I’m so vexxed, first he steals my coconut oil and now my last pore strip !!!??????? Dpmo
989 2018-02-03 21:23:47 Have we finished refining our own crude? The obsession for oil yet again. A government that is shouting about diversification. Why not build one in a state begging for it and get Nigeriens to export the crude into Nigerian like we've been doing to other countries.
990 2018-02-03 21:23:42 It belongs to an old wood stove that also uses oil!!
991 2018-02-03 21:23:34 Jus picture after countless of screenings and interviews with due process u start a nursery school teacher wit 250k, a primary 1 teacher wit 400k do u think pple will love to wrk in d banks n oil companies. U will see professionals taking up teaching jobs
992 2018-02-03 21:23:25 Goodyear Tires, Ford car seats, paint with soy oil in it, to name a few
993 2018-02-03 21:23:20 The amount of oil in a cell phone is less than a 100th of the oil in your gas burner's tank. Stop being concerned about my communication devices, and start looking to replace your vehicles.
994 2018-02-03 21:23:19 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
995 2018-02-03 21:22:58 I think the is the @Telegraph as usually pouring oil on a fire and making mountains out of imaginary mole hills. Germans probably don't give a flying newspaper the time of day.
996 2018-02-03 21:22:44 Groundnut oil blanks.
997 2018-02-03 21:22:43 The authorities speak of US$150 Bn to be spent by oil companies in the next 50 years, assuming all blocks have commercial discoveries.
998 2018-02-03 21:22:41 My boyfriend has an accent so when he gets heated about something it thickens. We’re on the phone and he’s telling me about work, “I swaay on mi fookin loyfe oil quit.” Is all I got from the conversation

1010 2018-02-03 21:20:36 Make cake without eggs or oil just water, applesauce and pop lmao
1011 2018-02-03 21:20:18 They could be on an oil rig.
1012 2018-02-03 21:20:09 Lolzzzzz. Shebi we are asking for restructuring? Restructuring we will get. We cant eat our cake and still have it. We feel bcos we hv oil we can shakara other regions. By the time the federal govt will introduce onshore offshore then we will know we have nothing.

1020 2018-02-03 21:18:42 north sea oil isnt making much money - its a lazy tired argument
1021 2018-02-03 21:18:14 If you can report to a board on performance of hundreds of retail stores or an airline or an oil refinery, I’m sure it is possible to monitor the really key meaurements of a medium sized business like a football team. Maybe no one does.
1022 2018-02-03 21:18:09 Need an oil change 
1023 2018-02-03 21:18:01 More income to UK treasury than grant back to Scotland. Scotland seas are the oil source used for 40 years to prop up English negative balance of payments. 2008 crash showed up the false premise of the city earning anything.

1025 2018-02-03 21:17:30 europe was built by the bloods of patriots and after 1000 years muslim had oil and the riches and they send their people to europe so they can buy all western products.. Allah has oil.
1026 2018-02-03 21:17:18 Mick McCarthy said on BBC newcastle today that he felt for Chris Coleman because trying to get Sunderland to win is "like trying to stop an oil tanker."
1027 2018-02-03 21:17:14 Is that BP oil spill been plugged up yet?
1028 2018-02-03 21:17:09 I don't need you to turn off the lights at home. I need you to demand your representatives stop subsidizing coal and oil production.
1029 2018-02-03 21:17:06 That's #februdairy muted, To all those pontificating Vegans 
 When you stop using Coconut oil (Slave monkeys), 
Palm Oil (Have a google) and
 Almond milk (Destruction of honey bees and draining of aquifers in California) 
I will then give a hoot about your opinion
1030 2018-02-03 21:16:54 It’s muh fuckin ,uhhhh February ...... and We frolicking in the sand in Malibu . The coconut oil is poppin
1031 2018-02-03 21:16:43 I am going to start throwing shit away. I'm tired of these mystery round oil stains
1032 2018-02-03 21:16:32 Oil. What’s makes Dubai is the oil money  , can we say that to Nigeria 
1033 2018-02-03 21:16:25 Like middle east identified with oil exports; India must be identified with value added processed food exports!
1034 2018-02-03 21:16:11 Only cos you think nat supporters are wrong,once you realise half the voters must know something you dont then you might start to question
Ask yersell ,if in EU England had to share the UK`s oil and gas revenue,do you think England would accept 8% and let the EU take 92% ?
1035 2018-02-03 21:15:57 Ozokerite, Stearalkonium Bentonite, Propylene Carbonate, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Ethyl Vanillin, Bixa Orellana Seed Extract, Bht, Tin Oxide, [May Contain/Peut Contenir (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides
1036 2018-02-03 21:15:56 Nope I watch and all they talk about is record numbers in the stock market. Employment is up jobs are starting to pay more we get a tax break. I never seen any of this during the Obama years.  Oil is back gas is back.  You people just don’t get it at all!!
1037 2018-02-03 21:15:56 Like the middle east identified with oil exports, the comparative advantage of India is in its becoming value added exporter of processed foods.
1038 2018-02-03 21:15:55 Honestly, it's killer. Generous helping of good olive oil in the tomato sauce too.
1039 2018-02-03 21:15:44 Struggling to stay awake during your afternoon meetings? Try adding some maca powder and coconut oil to your AM coffee or smoothie.
1040 2018-02-03 21:15:39 It is fun dating a married man untill u discover one day that he saved ur number as engine oil
1041 2018-02-03 21:15:17 From sea food is a nice sentiment but polluted oceans create problems & difficult to eat enough seafood to counter excess omega 6 . The only guaranteed pure Omega 3 is “molecularly distillation “ of fish oil
1042 2018-02-03 21:15:16 @CulkinWorld That's just what it looks like to me, It looks like a motor oil stain as far as I can see.. I tried Oxi Clean HD Liquid detergent.. For best cleaning results, pour detergent onto stain and rub vigorously and that's exactly what I did and the stain didn't come out
1043 2018-02-03 21:15:14 Do you prefer oil paint, acrylic paint or airbrush?
1044 2018-02-03 21:14:39 Getting it the right consistency is up to practice. Just cook it a bunch and eventually you'll find what works!
I find medium-low heat diced up with olive oil and veggies seems to work.
1045 2018-02-03 21:14:28 Hello Elizabeth!  Hope you enjoy a long, long ride with us
1046 2018-02-03 21:14:28 The one problem of using tea tree oil is that you then smell like tea tree oil.
1047 2018-02-03 21:14:16 10/ I'm not ragging on them for having dreams and trying to push tech. But when you start to take money from people and don't meet promises there's little diff between that and a Snake Oil salesman.
1048 2018-02-03 21:14:06 The worst part about oil changes is justbsitting around doing nothing 
1049 2018-02-03 21:13:43 Hoy se hizo la entrega del Moroccan  oil , Gracias Esperamos a la ganadora del French FROISSE  excelente fin de semana !!!!!!!!

1058 2018-02-03 21:12:40 The olive oil guy at the Silverlake Farmers market told me that LA is like a horse that can’t be broken. He also told me to try one of his olive oils on fresh fruit.I have a whole new life outlook now.
1059 2018-02-03 21:12:11 I’ve gone overboard on the facemasks and face oil tonight. I’m taking relaxation and wellness to a whole (wrong) new level..... don’t tell @davelackie

1061 2018-02-03 21:11:56 @CulkinWorld Will you please do me a favor and check your messages that I sent to you on Reddit? I would be so happy if you would respond to those messages... I went to the laundromat and washed a comforter and tried to get the stains out with Oxi Clean detergent. Motor Oil stain
1062 2018-02-03 21:11:49 @BioWillieFuel I understand Willie’s concern about reducing the use of foreign oil. What I don’t understand is why he puts it in his foreign Mercedes that’s kind of hypocritical.
1063 2018-02-03 21:11:29 Love the smell of bio oil
1064 2018-02-03 21:11:25 Car shop’s try to tell me everything wrong with my car that cost a billion $’s like bro just change my oil and let me suffer in peace.. 
1065 2018-02-03 21:11:19 At Least try and appreciate the perfect synchrony of oil and water.just like ikogosi hot and cold water spring that doesn't mix

1082 2018-02-03 21:08:41 When it comes to the Kinder Morgan pipeline, Trudeau and Notley had better think again. We BC people are gatekeepers of the Pacific shores & a seven-fold increase in oil tanker traffic is far too high a risk to take. No matter what their age, everyone here is engaged and enraged.
1083 2018-02-03 21:08:39 Thank you all fr your sincere prayers,mum has just bn discharged, wishing her a quick recuperation

1091 2018-02-03 21:07:32 The entire argument of Alberta oil vs SA oil is a straw dog invented by CAPP.  The reality is the more investment in old, dirty energy, the longer it will take for the age of dirty fuel to end.  & the more damage to our kids futures.
1092 2018-02-03 21:07:29 I’m gonna learn how to change the oil on my car some way, some how because childdddddd.. my patience.

1094 2018-02-03 21:07:14 Your late cuz you take your time to make sure everything you do is perfect  there is no shame in that.  But I'm late cuz I'm stupid and I was born a week late. I came out purple I could have died if my mom didn't drink castor oil. 
1095 2018-02-03 21:06:51 47? really? wow. And all the support fron Turkey to Isis? buying oil etc.  you are not good informed.
1096 2018-02-03 21:06:29 Extend the railway through Skye to a tunnel near Dunvegan and thence to the closest point in Uist. 
Followed by a railway connecting Stornoway to Barra 

Also extend north line to Orkney. 

Simples! 

Norway manages to do these kind of things, but of course they have oil....
1097 2018-02-03 21:06:20 You are either clueless or invested in oil, which is it? Energy sources are being converted to solar and wind with dropping prices. Metals mined for battery production are not Burnt away. Batteries can be recycled when degraded. Battery production can be clean, not oil.
1098 2018-02-03 21:06:08 In all honesty, I just put some of the essential oil on, and it's driving the ladies crazy

1104 2018-02-03 21:04:51 Speaking as a fine art painter, I admire former US President George W. Bush for taking up oil painting and making portraits of his friends around the world, instead bickering about and sabotaging the president I voted for.
1105 2018-02-03 21:04:39 on the surface seems like its abt farmers in Zimbabwe... the switcharoo is insane... bet its really abt oil drilling
1106 2018-02-03 21:04:34 When he joins the best clubs in those countries...for sure...He’d never come to Liverpool unless we get oil money too
1107 2018-02-03 21:04:29 Unless you're rich you DO get a refund lol. And the Ctax is so much more than a social license. It's a way for our province to stop being a bitch to big oil and gas companies. I mean, look at the benefits!
1108 2018-02-03 21:04:27 Gonna do the maros oil change today it's about that time!
1109 2018-02-03 21:04:21 But, But, But Big Oil won't let us. They run the country. What can we do? I say make a blue wave and make positive changes for everyone to live in peace

1115 2018-02-03 21:03:28 Crazy what you can do with oil money, isn’t it?
1116 2018-02-03 21:03:28 In this case the 'secret sauce' is corn oil and glucose combined with B vitamins

Russia's economy was being decimated by those low oil prices. Well, I guess you can't expect these folks to read.

1126 2018-02-03 21:00:49 @jengerson a little piece of biased journalism there Jen.Nothing at all about the devastation BRITISH COLUMBIANS will pay for in event of oil spills of which there are 1000s mostly unreported per year w/wide. Nor of how KM has a history of shafting BC on hydro bills...
1127 2018-02-03 21:00:45 Just enough to cover the cost of the increase in gas prices. Good think big oil got those billions in tax breaks... hate to see what the increases would've been without them...

1140 2018-02-03 20:58:30 Comments I heard at #DefundETP protest from passerby’s:

“Get a job!”
“Instead of distupting they should have a conversation.”
“Didn’t the bus you take use oil?”
“We can’t see the flying snowmobile!”

*Mostly* par for the course.
1141 2018-02-03 20:58:28 I don’t ever wax my eyebrows, but I do trim and pluck them and coconut oil and Eucerine lotion usually helps with any redness or irritation that occurs. I have also heard that aloe vera gel works well to reduce irritation too.
1142 2018-02-03 20:58:24 What it does do is bring into question validity of claims of collusion. It goes to core of what prompted/drove this narrative.
1143 2018-02-03 20:58:24 Pizza parties with little kids who were trafficked. Think about the movie “Taken” and where the daughter was taken to. Some big time oil dude on a boat going down the Seine.
1144 2018-02-03 20:58:20 Economy been growing for the past 5 years;
Military Modernization programs authorized by Obama (leave the military out of your foolishness);
Undercutting Russian oil? Russia needed oil prices up from $30/barrel because it was killing their economy, it's $65 "critical thinker.
1145 2018-02-03 20:58:02 What are you using? I rub a bit of warmed coconut oil in and then some baby shampoo and rinse with loads of warm water... 
1146 2018-02-03 20:57:56 I got a platinum oil change @jiffylube and they even vacuumed my floor and gave me a $20 discount

1149 2018-02-03 20:57:27 Hoping to boost fossil fuel prices, the oil industry has lobbied to change vehicle efficiency ratings from "miles per gallon" (mpg) to the much cooler "dinosaur bodies per hour" (db/h)
1150 2018-02-03 20:57:20 You can also sprinkle with olive oil and balsamic and have them just like that! As an app
1151 2018-02-03 20:57:18 If I just drove 40min out to Tracy just for these fools to tell me I’m not getting my oil change for free I’m gonna be really pissed off.
1152 2018-02-03 20:56:58 Do you know anything about the pending deal between Russia & Iran: Oil for (500) Russian jet fighters! The news has just come out in Libanaise newspapers.

1155 2018-02-03 20:56:39 I've lived in both BC and Alberta. I agree that the oil industry needs to be environmentally responsible. There are better ways to address a problem than to insult and name call. In fact, you've lost your argument once you resort to those tactics.

1157 2018-02-03 20:56:18 Chart rigs and US oil production. You will see a growing disconnect.

Of course you may not be interested in counter evidence to your thesis.

1159 2018-02-03 20:56:09 Climate crisis? What crisis? Many benefits of more CO2 like better plant growth and many benefits of warming too such as longer growing seasons, higher crop yields, lower heating bills and less death by freezing. Canada net beneficiary of warming AND oil exports with huge taxes!!
1160 2018-02-03 20:55:33 I personally don’t pluck or do anything to my brows but I’ve heard baby oil is good to use before plucking
1161 2018-02-03 20:55:29 I’m using the “spring cleaning” essential oil diffuser mix to try and fake the scent of a clean house. I can’t decide what I hate more, my laziness or trendiness.
1162 2018-02-03 20:55:11 And they can be made with the same oil!

1163 2018-02-03 20:54:48 Or two....

1165 2018-02-03 20:54:33 I hate waiting for oil changes. Only good thing that comes out of it is I can catch up on shows
1166 2018-02-03 20:54:17 Time to apply Oil to (using North Indian Lingo).. Hasua.. Gadasa.. Talwar.. and if One has Double Barrels, making sure those are well greased and cleaned. Time for Hindu Army.
1167 2018-02-03 20:54:10 You are basically low IQ moron too because you dont know that doing oil trade and business with Israel doenst make you slave but fighting for their cause makes you.

1169 2018-02-03 20:54:00 How much is she going to lose when all the social services are removed?

Health care? Schools? Deductibles? The EPA? CFPB?

What price on the DIGNITY of the people of the United States of America not to be sold out for $1.50 a week to the coal and oil barons?

@IronStache
1170 2018-02-03 20:53:58 Hitting the pregame cocktails early?  That's a solar panel, you know, like those your corrupt overlord slapped a huge tariff on in order to kill green energy options so you all can make the big $$$ off your Russia oil deal that was contingent on no sanctions.
1171 2018-02-03 20:53:54 That McSorley clearance was a memorable moment, as was his dad's walk onto the ice at game's end. 
Marty won the Cup as a RW that year & as a RD the next year, no mean feat.
1172 2018-02-03 20:53:36 Norway isn’t entirely angelic. They have their hands in developing the oil industry in Russia.
1173 2018-02-03 20:53:29 Who can do my oil change for me ?

1182 2018-02-03 20:51:42 Like oil companies purchase "scientists" to say climate change isn't real? Hey look! You're capable of understanding, Ryan! Now apply that 
1183 2018-02-03 20:51:33 *watches you go, my hands clenched into fists as my wolf roars at me, snarls at Paul when he makes a remark about the food smelling good, slams my fist into a nearby oil drum, caving it in as my knuckles split open, the pain perversely better than my shattered heart*
1184 2018-02-03 20:51:20 I don’t get anything y’all are saying. But you can pass the bread and olive oil.
1185 2018-02-03 20:51:19 Please my feet need it could you use warm Cocanut Oil Miss Ryu lol

1188 2018-02-03 20:50:48 Not yet actually, but "here come the snake oil salesmen" was the first thing I said when I heard about PEF.
1189 2018-02-03 20:50:40 Pro oil propaganda is not the truth. I bet that photo isnt even you. If anyone is paid to post crap its those pages.
1190 2018-02-03 20:50:34 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
1191 2018-02-03 20:50:33 honestly  I thought the whole 'pour coconut oil over it to fix it' applied to your face as well. Eeek
1192 2018-02-03 20:50:32 Since I ain't the president, I wouldn't answer that. 
North being alive largely depends on northerners & their acceptance for industrialization.
Oil exploration is intense in both Northeast & Northwest, signifying quest for ........??
1193 2018-02-03 20:50:28 I had Reaganomics over here but I even remember the oil crisis in the early 1970s under Ford. The oil embargo was what got us meddling in the Middle East. A lot of shit like our surveillance started back then. Yes,  !
1194 2018-02-03 20:50:14 A quart of oil. #$1.50Won’tBuy
1195 2018-02-03 20:50:09 @ChrisGPackham  I thought palm oil was like sunflower oil., totally naive how many products contain it.... we must change our shopping habits to save our world and its people.
1196 2018-02-03 20:50:07 Oil has gone up quite a bit, and OPEC gave them a good deal
1197 2018-02-03 20:49:53 like ok. i get it. the pipeline has a lot of money tied up in it. a lot of money that would go direct from oil companies to government pockets, but nonetheless. the pipeline is a matter of the national economy. except ONE FUCKING SPILL in the vancouver harbour...
1198 2018-02-03 20:49:50 Oil change... Sad. 
1199 2018-02-03 20:49:48 There’s a Chinese ointment and I think the English translation is “white flower oil” but that stuff usually works for me
1200 2018-02-03 20:49:24 Just saw a nigga walking down the block with no shirt on and mad baby oil on
1201 2018-02-03 20:49:22 Not just in oil in every business and no football isn't different. City is the best project in world football
1202 2018-02-03 20:49:14 Scheduled an oil change for my Tundra on Monday. 
1203 2018-02-03 20:49:01 My ST  trading plan is real simple:
 
US dollar bounce continues next week
Long DXY = short all other currencies including gold and silver
Short oil
Buy NG on pullback below 280
Bonds bounce along with DXY
Buy panics lows in US stocks Monday/Tuesday

1206 2018-02-03 20:48:29 When my fiancée was vegan she always break up Kale, season in a little oil and sea salt .. bake it into chips. Shit was addicting, simple and delicious texture
1207 2018-02-03 20:48:24 John west tuna in brine, sunflower oil, and spring water 
1208 2018-02-03 20:47:46 Lol why is "warm" specified? Is warm oil worse for you than cold or room temp? And there are different kinds of pizza, some aren't that bad. This is pizza racism.
1209 2018-02-03 20:47:36 In the oil business maybe, football is a little different
1210 2018-02-03 20:47:30 One of these witches nearly had me with this coconut oil mess. My oily T-Zone broke out in laughter
1211 2018-02-03 20:47:30 I have strong feelings about snake oil selling predators who endanger and rip off MY food allergy/sensitivity community. 
1212 2018-02-03 20:47:23 I would really like to own one of those essential oil humidifiers.
1213 2018-02-03 20:47:23 can't believe some of your fans twisting about a 1-1 draw at Burnley on twitter.FFS 10 years ago you got spanked 8-0 off boro before the oil money came forth.The cunts need a reality check,How you don't slap them.........
1214 2018-02-03 20:47:16 underrated toolbox items, stolen from @cbcalvin:
• bar of soap, wax candle: you're probably sleeping on both of these as semi-dry lubricants
• toothbrush (just save an old one)
• 3-in-1 oil, another pretty ok lubricant (WD-40 is not a lubricant, it's maintenance debt)

1216 2018-02-03 20:47:03 I’ve come to the conclusion breathing is so last year, blocked sinuses is what it’s all about now; Vicks vapour rub and Olbas Oil are my new best friends, Pinot and Prosecco are dumped #Sinusitis
1217 2018-02-03 20:46:39 Ah no. You have to remove most of the oil (and sadly the smell) and then run through an industrial press. Miele though 
1218 2018-02-03 20:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1219 2018-02-03 20:46:11 Ive had it with pro oil trolls! I am done and i will be trolling them back!
1220 2018-02-03 20:45:48 *struggles to keep up my harsh demeanor* Ate already. *calls out* Paul, look at Bella’s truck when you finish that oil change. *ignores his snarky “Whatever you say, Boss”, my demeanor softens just a little* Charlie has chemo today...I’ll give you a ride back to the Hospital.
1221 2018-02-03 20:45:45 Thanks! I never heard of using tea tree oil, I’ve used color oops tho it does smell! It works fairly well tho
1222 2018-02-03 20:45:45 He has seen & tasted the oil in turkana.
1223 2018-02-03 20:45:25 Try adding some salt to it and a lil bit of veg oil.
1224 2018-02-03 20:45:23 Partisan hacks are everywhere, but generally making/ keeping $ requires living in reality on  Earth and not Earth II.
1225 2018-02-03 20:45:20 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1226 2018-02-03 20:45:05 Are you a lawyer? No? Then what the fuck do you know of obstruction statutes.

You are a snake oil salesman from Queens who has slimed his way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 

Enjoy while you can. Mueller is smarter, better organized and a man of integrity.

1227 2018-02-03 20:45:03 How the witchcraft fuck do they extract the oil from cod livers

1231 2018-02-03 20:44:34 They did! I got a little overzealous with the orange oil for the sticker residue and took off some of the silver from the vines after the pic was taken, but I’m still so thrilled to have a PB copy of ACOWAR! And Nyxia is so pretty!! 
1232 2018-02-03 20:44:29 I've said it before and I'll say it again. I think The Oil scene in DUNKIRK is one of the best sequences of filmmaking *ever*
1233 2018-02-03 20:44:28 He's been worthy of a 25th amendment since way before the white house. But with Republicans in control they wont do anything cuz they want a dumb/disoriented #POTUS to use to further their Iraq War 2.0 agenda on N.K and Iran. Ensures $ for their oil and mil equipment donors
1234 2018-02-03 20:44:27 Ah, you see the beauty of my new non stick pan is that I don't have to use butter or oil. The appliance of science.
1235 2018-02-03 20:44:27 I completely agree.We shd be refining our own oil,keeping environmentally sustainable jobs+investment in Canada.If we accept protestors illogical views it means we don't help Asia reduce its coal emisssions+we keep importing from Saudi Arabia etc.
1236 2018-02-03 20:44:14 Yes, please follow back. Strength in numbers...
1237 2018-02-03 20:44:07 It took 20 years of suing Big Oil to remove lead from gas, their scientist said lead was safe. Don’t Trust Big Money

1239 2018-02-03 20:43:30 We're running out of oil, we're running out of resources, we're running out of control - not long left to make that change - and everyday more and more people wake up -

1251 2018-02-03 20:42:04 Sure, but you vote in blair/bush and all these elite politicians that go & commit murder. Oil has been one valuable commodity for the west. It will get it no matter how much blood it, or its propped up lackeys will spill. 
Funny thing, people with no prospects tend to immigrate.
1252 2018-02-03 20:41:47 I’m about to nap here at Walmart the 2hrs for my oil to be changed

1255 2018-02-03 20:40:59 Yep! Or even peppermint essential oil can work too. Temples and wrists. 

The morning sickness drug is a (slow release so they charge a bajillion dollars for OTC stuff) combo of I think vitamin b6 and unisom so you can try to buy those separate? Google might know!
1256 2018-02-03 20:40:43 im gonna join in on this real quick and just say........tea tree oil is also GREAT for stripping hair color, ive done it before and its helped!

1292 2018-02-03 20:33:57 Thank you for bringing up Kaduna refinery, which is closed because nobody knows how to supply it with crude oil in an economically feasible way. In the past 50 % of Kaduna refinery's incoming capacity was heavy crude which came from Iran and Venezula (crude swaps). What a joke!!
1293 2018-02-03 20:33:54 1) Worth, imo this is bigger than what is being reported. We are at economic war with China. Trump is putting tremendous pressure on China through a weak dollar policy. The NK situation and the China and Russia oil trading deal in Yuan back by gold...

1296 2018-02-03 20:33:40 Do you know how much they charge for a oil change and tire rotation? Cause my dealership charges $56 and they fill your fluids too i think
1297 2018-02-03 20:33:37 Sounds plausible. It's how Hoover operated.
1298 2018-02-03 20:33:20 Remember old Jed Klampitt?  

The guy’s ONLY MOTIVATION was to shoot for some food. Therefore that bubblin’ crude, oil that is! Black gold. Texas T. None of that is real. 

So why didn’t ol’ Jed just go home and forget about it? #BeLikeJed #FISA #FBI #DOJ #MOTIVATION
1299 2018-02-03 20:33:02 U.S. is a net exporter of natural gas, the country is still a net importer of energy sources, most notably oil. As for “clean coal”, the EPA has rolled back regulations on the burning of coal, but nothing has been done to revive the dying coal industry clean coal isn’t a thing
1300 2018-02-03 20:32:49 Seriously though... unsalted nuts, fatty proteins, cheeses in moderation, certain rices in moderation (a rice maker may be a good investment) and use of whole fatty oils in cooking and dressing, sesame, peanut oil, homemade fried rice, scrambled eggs, roast fatty pork.
1301 2018-02-03 20:32:35 The Trump voter is the desperate woman who agrees to marry a traveling snake oil salesman to the detriment of herself and everyone dependent upon her.   He withdraws and spends her savings, mortgages her home, yet she believes in him, excuses him, dreams of riches.

1303 2018-02-03 20:32:28 what about things like Celeriac? (Fricking love Celeriac. Roasted, with mustard and oil.. or like matchsticks in a salad with apples)
1304 2018-02-03 20:32:26 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
1305 2018-02-03 20:32:26 1.) Niger exports scheduled to grow from 20 k bpd to >80 k.
2.) Short pipelines 
3.) >1 billion barrels of reserves
4.) Nigeria will get portion of the refined oil
5.) Of course it will reduce smuggling
6.) The first real potential for a refined oil distribution hub in the north

1308 2018-02-03 20:32:03 You're a hypocrite Joe.  Using  petroleum powered Internet, petroleum based computer or hand held device, to protest petroleum exploration.  It seems Joe as if you'd rather Iran lead the World in Oil Supply, because you believe they are more enviro friendly.

1315 2018-02-03 20:30:34 Bought CDB oil for a family member that has severe arthritis and I’m happy it did its job! No pain, slept, and got an appetite, everything she’s been lacking for months. Also, helped calm anxiety. :’)

1317 2018-02-03 20:30:30 Oven baked risotto with sweet potato and green beans. Lazy but delicious supper! Cook off onions and garlic for a bit in olive oil. Chuck in risotto for a bit to break it. Bung in an oven dish with stock, herbs, pepper and salt. Bob’s my uncle. Boooom.

#Trudeau said,“This is the last pipeline play we have to the world. There really is no bigger deal.”

WTF? Reread the statement. Consider where PMJTs thinking is on the future of #Canadian resource sector.
1321 2018-02-03 20:29:57 I’ve just substituted the “drizzle of olive oil” in this recipe for a “stiff pour of homemade habanero olive oil” and I think I might have done irreparable damage to my marriage. But I’m not worrying about that because right now I can’t feel my tongue.
1322 2018-02-03 20:29:50 I used arctic fox and I really love it because it's vegan, cruelty free, it only deposits colour, doesn't stain my skin, and it has grape seed oil in it to condition. I used 50% purple rain and 50% Violet dream.
1323 2018-02-03 20:29:50 Can we get an "Oil, Coolant, Start, Skids!" Tee, please :)

Jollof? Add a little oil and leave flame burning blue
1325 2018-02-03 20:29:39 You hit the various nails on the head. The issue I run into is a great martini, made perfectly. Then a Z grade olive is dropped in resulting in an oil slick on top of the drink. Why go through all the trouble to use top shelf liquor, but low grade condiments?

1327 2018-02-03 20:29:05 Keep displaying your stupidity online. The volume of crude oil in Nigeria can never be compared with that of Nigeria and if we ignore refining the one in Nigeria for that of Niger, what sense is there to it. You are the one who need education not me.

1334 2018-02-03 20:28:23 One Nan had a white wood-and-oil stove. Best place in the world was the rocking chair next to it (and this part). Second best place was the wood day bed next to the mustard-colored was-wood-converted-to-oil stove in Dad's childhood home.

1336 2018-02-03 20:27:26 Ya know, #mayonnaise is magic.
You take an egg yolk, whisk in some vinegar & seasonings, and then start adding a liquid; just oil, drop by drop by drop by drop... and it seems to be getting soupier, and nothing's happening, and it's all gonna fail, and then suddenly - magic!

Enough valid data to support campus carry without making stuff up. Good for pointing this out.
1349 2018-02-03 20:25:12 I never understood how people could lose their card/ID on Dickson but here I am now, after a night on Dickson, trying to get an oil change with no card and no ID
1350 2018-02-03 20:25:02 Lol L= liquid/leave in O= oil C= Cream .... Liquid can be water or a spray leave in. Cream usually your styling product and oil is whatever you oil you prefer... I like jojoba, olive, and coconut.
1351 2018-02-03 20:24:58 Libya has the world's 9th largest crude oil reserves. Libya has more crude oil than Nigeria.

1354 2018-02-03 20:24:40 VERY seldom used at pops when we were smaller cuz he didn't like to waste oil. When he got older and didn't want to be at the wood it's all he used
1355 2018-02-03 20:24:33 It depends the use! It’s just soaking it overnight bc of impurities boo so if you wanna harvest the gel and keep it like in the fridge DEFINITELY do that and whip it with vitamin e oil or grapeseed oil to preserve it
1356 2018-02-03 20:24:31 Now the question is, what can one add to @Elmhurst1925 milks to get the fat content high enough to foam in an Isi foamer... hrmmmm

(I mean, other than coconut oil/cream, which is just such an overpowering flavor)

1364 2018-02-03 20:23:29 If your man doesn’t know how to AT LEAST do an oil change you should probably leave him

1373 2018-02-03 20:22:05 Stupid argument. That's y govt loosing kpopularity. Mini support price is fake. Who buys at price higher than international market? State or central govt can buy just 5 to 10% of farm produce for. FCI & other agencies. Govt allows import of edible oil to please people like Adani
1374 2018-02-03 20:21:55 Trudeau needs to figure out how not to be the water boy for big oil.  We do not need this industry to expand in Canada.
1375 2018-02-03 20:21:53 WHEN? 

When control of those things affects other businesses and thier ability to compete. When selling things at a loss or "nonprofit" causes job loses for otherS.
Basically the opposite of how Standard Oil did things but just as deadly.

ONLY 1 is like that = $AMZN BREAK IT UP

1384 2018-02-03 20:20:03 We will be still needing to sell oil, we have a chance to get new lines built which we will in time be able to retire the 50 year lines that we use now which btw for 30 years have been flowing with bituman,
1385 2018-02-03 20:20:01 Why would we invest billions on an oil transportation system when we could invest that money on renewable energy? Isn't reducing our reliance on oil altogether the most environmentally sustainable?
1386 2018-02-03 20:19:46 can i have ur balls in olive oil?
1387 2018-02-03 20:19:38 And the greatest thing is that crude oil get refind in India so there should be more cheaper price then any other countries as there are no import charges..and why there is no GST on Petrol and Diesel. They just filling there own pockets from our money..

1396 2018-02-03 20:18:32 No, the fallacy is that growing oil consumption somehow proves the green energy sector isn't growing.

1398 2018-02-03 20:18:26 How about no more oil pipelines! Instead we would love new roads, bridges, dams, and more investment in alternative energy sources like solar, which your new tariff does not benefit.
1399 2018-02-03 20:18:22 It takes much more than that to coke oil lines -- no big deal.

1414 2018-02-03 20:16:37 Suck and blow simultaneously being something a Green knows well. But you’re wrong. Canada develops its oil resources using the world’s best environment protection methods. Unlike Saudi, Nigerian, or US who sell millions of barrels to Canada. Use theirs? Lose jobs and govt $ here?
1415 2018-02-03 20:16:37 Is that acylics or oil?
1416 2018-02-03 20:16:24 Get Russia to buy more Alaskan Oil and Natural Gas please, we need our Oil to be 150 a barrel or higher would be great. Make Big Oil pay their fare share of Taxes. No rebates.

1422 2018-02-03 20:16:07 Dear #NarendraModi today India purchesed crude oil at 68 $ for 1 barrel . Which was for below 50 1 month  before .. so In indian you can sell petrol after transport at 45 rp. Max. Then Why India have so much tax ? Why 81 rp per litre ?

1425 2018-02-03 20:15:37 I wish Puerto Rico would become a #Hemp Utopia. The root systems will stabilize the soil and prevent erosion/landslides. The farmers will need an alternative. 3-4 harvest per year. Most versatile plant on the planet. The oil from the seeds have both human and industrial uses.

1430 2018-02-03 20:15:12 Maybe when they get their first February paycheck...

Snake oil will not pay their bills.  They’ll be lucky if they get $25 more per paycheck, assuming they get paid every two weeks. That’s not even a full tank of gas . . .

1439 2018-02-03 20:13:29 Same reasons papers & news aren't talking about trump declining to enforce the #RussianSanctions bill. 1. They're Corporations ran by the same type of people who run banks, oil companies, military contractors, and insurance companies. 2. They need trump. He sells subscriptions.
1440 2018-02-03 20:13:29 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
1441 2018-02-03 20:13:22 Only if you film it.
1442 2018-02-03 20:13:16 I've not researched coal but I deal with oil and gas executives and they're kicking it. Which is the only big export Russia has. Not something they want to see.

1449 2018-02-03 20:12:56 Not only that: The DOJ/FBI has a duty to disclose this to Trump, as the GOP primary presidential candidate, then to the president  transition team. They chose not to.
1450 2018-02-03 20:12:52 I know that the big oil companies can transition to green! Let’s see them be an example to the planet! I’m with you and I know you’ll be a blessing!

1453 2018-02-03 20:12:33 My car miles hit 3000 the exact day of my oil change and I feel like a magician now 
1454 2018-02-03 20:12:30 When people leave their oil in my car
1455 2018-02-03 20:12:23 you are supposed to drain the pasta, then put it back in the pan with the sauce and some oil or butter, and cook it on high for a minute while stirring vigorously. That's how real italians do it
1456 2018-02-03 20:12:22 putting powder under my foundation has actually helped some but.. the oil just won't quit smh

1460 2018-02-03 20:12:01 2011 Yvonne, when oil revs were £12b thy're now next to zero. I'll send you an update.
1461 2018-02-03 20:11:53 How is the Keystone pipeline improving infrastructure? The only thing it does is potentially harm the land and water in the area. No benefit to anyone except big oil.

Oil on the road
1464 2018-02-03 20:11:32 As I shared in my report on #Gold last week and can be applied to Oil and Stocks too. There's clearly a battle going on between Fundamentals, Fed policy, on one side and technicals, positioning, sentiment on the other. All comes down to the $. Friday's action confirmed that imo.
1465 2018-02-03 20:11:24 Oh dear! I hope you’ve cleaned your gun. Hmmmmm I love the smell of gun oil. 
1466 2018-02-03 20:11:23 No. The immunoassay conducted by your physician is checking for THC, not CBD. As long as you find CBD oil online completely derived from the hemp plant (not from the MJ plant), there will be no THC in it - and won'g be detected in UDT.
1467 2018-02-03 20:11:18 @GenevieveNnaji1 does your hands smell like hot oil
1468 2018-02-03 20:10:52 Probably only an Oil Rig will have his name emblazoned  on it
1469 2018-02-03 20:10:44 So you're suggesting we buy Oil from China so we don't have to drill here?  How else will our Food Trucks run ?
1470 2018-02-03 20:10:37 Let’s see the existing oil pipeline be used to transport clean water and needed environmentally non fossil fuel based benefits to all people, a animals and insects and bacteria ASAP!

1472 2018-02-03 20:10:25 in a bit of time it'll even out and work okay. the motor bearing is probably in need of some new lube too, but I have no easy way to tell you how to solve that. easiest way is legit a hypodermic needle with a syringe and some machine oil or grease.
1473 2018-02-03 20:10:11 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
1474 2018-02-03 20:10:11 On Energy East, the truth is TransCanada started it when oil was $100 per barrel and they though Keystone XL was dead. They never wanted to do both. There isn't a market for both for more than a decade at minimum.
1475 2018-02-03 20:10:00 chimney. Maybe y'all can do a video on this I would truly appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time your videos and your ability to share your knowledge.

But if frontal attack is therefore hard, its flanks are wide open."
1479 2018-02-03 20:09:33 Both parties stuck on repetative rhetoric which does not move voters to change views. It just reinforces and entrenches base of both sides
1480 2018-02-03 20:09:33 ....sadly I think they like being misinformed. It's easier for them to believe conspiracy theories than to accept the fact that they've bought the snake oil trump was peddling or the bs he was shoveling.
1481 2018-02-03 20:09:24 I have too keep oil in my scalp. I just have too 
1482 2018-02-03 20:09:21 @tvcnewsng @BWemimoTVC  Sorry to be controversial,But Ekwueme was in the NPN that frustrated Awolowo from being President of Nigeria and could have introduced Good Free Health in Nigeria from the oil funds.

We created Iran's loathing.

1) douse and roast the vegetables in olive oil
2) add salt and pepper
3) cook the pasta and meat
4) douse in olive oil
5) make the fond/gravy/sauce, add olive oil
1492 2018-02-03 20:07:45 Those pipeline projects are using CANADA OIL, NOT OUR OIL, and are selling it to foreign buyers. We the people will get exactly no benefit from these projects.

1504 2018-02-03 20:05:00 @realDonaldTrump This pipeline has no jobs and will make oil companies wealthier -- there is no benefit to a pipeline that sends the oil to other countries ...
1505 2018-02-03 20:04:39 The people protesting this don't care about facts. They think landlocking oil will deliver some kind of green nirvana, which isn't the case but they don't care.

1511 2018-02-03 20:03:49 but if u hate them a lot then put coconut oil on them!! it really helps me
1512 2018-02-03 20:03:47 I just cringe when I see rail tankers moving oil and gas through communities. Tracks never go through the good side of towns. Pipelines are certainly not perfect but road and rail for oil and gas are scary and too often the case due to lack of modern pipelines.
1513 2018-02-03 20:03:40 I'm also tired of putting coconut oil all over my nose to stop the nose chafing
1514 2018-02-03 20:03:37 @ollyofficial  are you losing your hair?  I read an article that said if we still have hair on our head there’s potential for regrowth.  I use shampoo with caffeine (it blocks DHT) and Argan oil.  Hope this helps.
1515 2018-02-03 20:03:29 How do you know that Beto O'Rourke is not a corporate shill? Does that mean, he is not accepting any campaign donations from SuperPACs (Corporate & other big business lobby)? Has he refused money from BIg Oil & Gas, the MWIC?
1516 2018-02-03 20:03:27 Turns like an oil tanker....

1524 2018-02-03 20:02:44 Do countries that play rugby have movements to stop the game? This is inherently more violent the American Football. By the way...I love this Sport. I've seen a punch thrown, and elbow dropped and someone's oil was checked in view of everyone, been watching 15 minutes 
1525 2018-02-03 20:02:38 So where do we draw the Line of  something like "Cloud Seeding" and "Act of GOD".... These Oil Pigs and Church Elites are NOT GODS!!!! But they Get away with crimes that affects all of us to put more $ in der pockets Daily, Colder the Temp, Higher our Energy bills.
1526 2018-02-03 20:02:38 Two pipelines, which have already spilled, bring dirty shale oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. How does that improve American infrastructure? When does the removal of the rest of West Virginia to get to that "beautiful clean coal" start?
1527 2018-02-03 20:02:25 *plot purposes

Basking in the light reflected off the glistening oil of the Rock’s knockers is reason enough but it doesn’t have a purpose in the plot. Unless he uses that light to blind the villain. Which is plausible.

1533 2018-02-03 20:00:48 These aren't examples of beneficial infrastructure. If we continue to extract oil+shale gas we're taking away from our chances of survival due to #GlobalWarming We need to QUICKLY move to renewable+clean energy. Also, nothing "beautiful" about coal-Not fooling me #SDGs
1534 2018-02-03 20:00:43 Not if the Democrats and media (but I repeat myself) can help it!

1540 2018-02-03 20:00:34 People voted for Trump because they bought the snake oil he was selling.  As soon as they realize it hasn’t cured them, they will lose interest.  It never was about middle class America but about lining the pockets of the rich and a thirst for power.
1541 2018-02-03 20:00:31 Marci. It’s not chocolate but it’s excellent for sore throats; try oil of oregano. You’re supposed to try a few drops in water but I just drop a couple straight into my throat it’s horrible for a moment but man!, it works 
1542 2018-02-03 20:00:26 I guess it’s my boyfriends reaction that made me panic  I’ll stick to the coconut oil body butter, thank you!

Anti oil and anti coal
1548 2018-02-03 20:00:00 coconut oil is not good for the pores 
1549 2018-02-03 19:59:56 And oil = bad, especially with rapidly evolving alternatives and the oil industry's long history of doing everything in it's power to avoid environmental responsibility.
1550 2018-02-03 19:59:52 It has been my opinion since the campaign that this is the whole reason the Russians wanted Trump in power. They want Trump to kill the sanctions so that Rosneft can develop oil and gas interests in the arctic. It would make them all big bucks.
1551 2018-02-03 19:59:29 I met a well educated (private school) immigrant from Kuwait last night who came from oil money and refused to acknowledge that he was in a more priveleged position than most Americans.
1552 2018-02-03 19:59:20 UK Government is refusing to tax oil production so they can sustain the myth that Scotland is subsidised.
1553 2018-02-03 19:59:16 They will get 'transition' funds to go from being dominant players in the oil+gas energy market to dominant players in the renewables sector. I would bet on some kind of '~net co2 negative' biomass -> hydrocarbon process so they can keep refineries, but could be geothermal too
1554 2018-02-03 19:59:06 Don’t have olive oil? Motor oil makes a great substitute.
1555 2018-02-03 19:58:52 Honestly so obsessed with ever @ILovePacifica product. Their sea foam complete face wash and super flower rapid response face oil are amazing. TBH, any of their skin care products are gold

1557 2018-02-03 19:58:40 So, Whiny Donny, you're going to steal public tax revenue to build these private, NON-INFRASTUCTURE, projects? How much do you stand to make from your Trump Corp. investments in these projects? How much are the Kochs paying you to approve their Big Oil projects?

1576 2018-02-03 19:56:13 There are so many uses for this powder!  Potting soil, war paint, driveway oil spills and oh, here's the kicker: dog poop coverup ... see ... the post must end with poop for it to be legit #nextdoor.
1577 2018-02-03 19:56:12 She technically is already naked, but they heavily imply it by having her in a bathtub of oil. Plankton's Grandma interrupts them just before they kiss btw
1578 2018-02-03 19:56:09 Nothing gets me going like a video of an animal being saved from an oil spill
1579 2018-02-03 19:56:04 Like trying to mix oil and water
1580 2018-02-03 19:55:47 You sell snake oil. Guifenasin has repeatedly been shown to have little to no efficacy. It's no surprise you're tweeting about being fake sick.
1581 2018-02-03 19:55:39 Bravo @DevinNunes #Dontbackdown
1582 2018-02-03 19:55:16 If as claimed by oil marketers, that landing cost of refined PMS in Lagos is N171/ltr, then fuel scarcity is going to linger till 2019.
1583 2018-02-03 19:55:13 Oil fired cars are so 20th century
1584 2018-02-03 19:55:03 Artificial Intelligence is bringing monumental changes to the way oil and gas businesses operate. Optimization in well service, compliance and run tickets, and mobile work orders are just a few of the many possible benefits #oilandgas #ArtificialIntelligence #Optimization #ENN
1585 2018-02-03 19:54:57 Saw young Opie lose it and throw a hissy fit with a group regarding the oil pipeline. I remember doing that kind of thing while growing up. Then I turned twelve!
Whether we like it or not we are players on the world stage and this kind of nonsense is unacceptable!
1586 2018-02-03 19:54:49 I cannot get over the fact people actually put coconut oil on their face, might aswell dip ur face in a deep fat fryer and call it a face mask
1587 2018-02-03 19:54:43 I think what’s been causing my headache is this stupid essential oil that I had high hopes for.
1588 2018-02-03 19:54:34 I’m planning on washing my hair tonight when I get home from work, so I put like a shit ton of rose oil in my hair like I usually do before I wash it and it’s so shiny lmfao my jobs gunna be like uhm ewww 
1589 2018-02-03 19:54:33 I KNOW I CANT WAIT TO OIL IT OMG
1590 2018-02-03 19:54:30 It does buy a cake mix (1.00-1.50).Then you have to add 3 eggs(60 cents) water, veg. oil (20cents). You are right.
1591 2018-02-03 19:54:15 Olive oil is good
1592 2018-02-03 19:54:13 "The intention of PMB is to give life to the North."
What is your own intention?
You don't want a North that's alive, do you?
What is the meaning of "same might be expected if crude oil is discovered in Sokoto"?
1593 2018-02-03 19:53:44 Studies are showing a higher percentage of fats & proteins instead of a higher carb intake are better for your body. Olive oil and avocado and other healthy fats can easily be added to meals for increased caloric intake.
1594 2018-02-03 19:53:34 my car starting to sound like a mario go kart i think it need some oil
1595 2018-02-03 19:53:30 Dental cement is sold at CVS and places like it... also clove oil is suppose to help with the pain. Make sure you avoid hard foods and keep it clean, but don't let it dry out!
1596 2018-02-03 19:53:29 thinking about selling cbd oil, hmu/like if you’d buy

1599 2018-02-03 19:52:23 I hate getting my oil changed smh
1600 2018-02-03 19:52:22 Not sure of that until all other measures taken. But historically and forecast, oil sands growth has been the major source of GHG growth. This cap, the first ever, and negotiated with ENGO participation, is significant.
1601 2018-02-03 19:52:22 I’m sorry about his cancer - I’m glad to hear the oil is working!! Praying it continues!! 
1602 2018-02-03 19:52:19 When you're looking for the oil in the cupboard and you move the oil out of the way to look behind it #derp
1603 2018-02-03 19:52:02 Optimum oil cartridges are 10% off today!!!
1604 2018-02-03 19:51:34 Take a vitamin C pill every 15 min.... squeeze a whole lemon in hot water/tea several times a day....lots and lots of oil of oregano.
1605 2018-02-03 19:51:16 I haven't used oil paint in 2018 yet and atm I Really want to but I can't. But when I can, I don't want to.
1606 2018-02-03 19:51:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
1607 2018-02-03 19:51:01 Investigation starts then later indulge in misleading court or even plant " evidence" I'm  absolved of wrongdoing bcse it started earlier?
1608 2018-02-03 19:50:38 It is the worst oil in the world and Canada will and can do and be better. Globally we are actually behind  compared to countries Europe and Asia. Canada will do better if we keep politics out of it.
1609 2018-02-03 19:50:36 So you are bragging about pumping Canadian oil to sell to China but polluting America and poisoning our water? #whodoyouworkfor #cleanenergy
1610 2018-02-03 19:50:34 The gas in the vehicle of discipleship is the love of God, the oil in the vehicle is the Holy Spirit! #YKC #3CUSA
1611 2018-02-03 19:50:30 Look at it this way.
Mobilize crews, take extremely high financial risks for gold/oil or whatever . Every oz/bbl you Harv and sell needs to replaced with another in the ground. rather be able to flick a light switch to replace that oz/bbl . Minimal risk and huge margins !
1612 2018-02-03 19:50:29 Actually the best stop in that game was made by Marty McSorely on the goal line :)
1613 2018-02-03 19:50:29 Continuing to push burning  Coal , Oil & Gas is stifling future technology's , progress & a clean environment , cleaner , less expensive & longer lasting energy is out there , but won't be explored w/ Trumps backward thinking that burning coal is the future.
1614 2018-02-03 19:50:24 So you worked for an oil company? Are you shitting me? And you’re proud of that?
1615 2018-02-03 19:50:22  oil got me feeling invincible lol
1616 2018-02-03 19:50:21 Agreed!
Securing the oil crescent should be a priority for #Hafter. Only way Dignity can save face given the recent international scrutiny is by prioritizing protecting it (instead of a siege on #Derna for example). Although as you said, highly improbable LNA can anyway. #Libya
1617 2018-02-03 19:50:20 I don’t like going to any maintenance place for my car because the guys working on it always give me shit about my ignition. But I HAVE to get my oil changed.
1618 2018-02-03 19:50:18 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1619 2018-02-03 19:50:09 Coconut oil. RT if u agree
1620 2018-02-03 19:50:03 I have the machine but have not made gummies. I like it but i'd recommend the levo oil infuser. It looks a little better and has a draining/filtering built in. It doesn't do tinctures tho. Or at least I don't think so
1621 2018-02-03 19:49:58 They have quadruple transformation in #ROO in textiles (apparel cut and sewn from originating fabric made from originating yarn made from originating fiber), but "made from petrochemicals derived from oil formed from domestic dinosaur" would definitely be sth novel
1622 2018-02-03 19:49:46 Typical Saudi attitude, just throw oil money and arms at your problem...
1623 2018-02-03 19:49:43 Something simple to give up that will help the environment by cutting plastic waste as well as use less oil based products are straws.  #plasticpollution
1624 2018-02-03 19:49:25 My son is 4th stage cancer, Canibis oil is working
1625 2018-02-03 19:49:24 So....it’s coconut oil dyed orange?
1626 2018-02-03 19:49:16 Lol. A weird oil and vinegar dispenser
1627 2018-02-03 19:49:03 Brother, antibiotics and steroids were the last thing you should have done.
Juice/ smoothie 3 times a day, along with immune strength (thieves oil) 3 times a day and all organic meals.
No matter how crappy you feel, you must get in sunshine/fresh air for at least 15 minutes a day

1629 2018-02-03 19:49:00 Page is out of business with the Russians for life.

Where will he do business next? Middle East or SouthAmerica? 

It all boils down to oil & drugs.
1630 2018-02-03 19:48:36 idk what coconut oil you smelling, that does smell soo good b
1631 2018-02-03 19:48:30 Shatterday Saturday, yo! Every Saturday we offer 10% off our vape carts, oils, distillates, isolates, hash, rosin, crystalline...all the good stuff, all day long :) #vape #bho #oil #thcdistillate #saturdayshatterday
1632 2018-02-03 19:48:23 Much less in the urban centers but its still there. BC has lots of Ag and oil so they will have the same issues as AB and SK
1633 2018-02-03 19:48:17 Like there's no reason a black runway model is only seen in wigs .. and tons of fucking oil on her skin. There should be hair people who can do natural hair.. and MUAs who can do makeup for black woman and have the right products.
1634 2018-02-03 19:47:58 Lamp oil, rope, bomb you want it it's yours my friend as long as you have enough rupees
1635 2018-02-03 19:47:45 I've recently started doing mine again for this very reason! Also, on my server barrels of oil sell for a few k each. 
1636 2018-02-03 19:47:43 You work for an oil company?
1637 2018-02-03 19:47:36 Talk about "part time" oil & gas work, no new projects | work until early March. Just a little shocked.
1638 2018-02-03 19:47:28 Oh common, we need to get the oil to market so it can be used to make electronic devices that SJWs can use for empty virtue signaling on the internet.
1639 2018-02-03 19:47:16 Technically lmao. She was in a bath with oil which I thought was pretty clever.
1640 2018-02-03 19:47:12 use coconut oil
1641 2018-02-03 19:47:10 What we "need" is to mine our own energy resources, not be oil dependent on our very enemies!

1643 2018-02-03 19:46:34 The office manager at my oil change place never ceases to crack me up. She’s on the phone right now “I giiiiives a fuuuuuuuck”
1644 2018-02-03 19:46:29 Corporate-owned Dems keep flogging this dead horse - 'if only we can find the right candidate to sell our snake oil, we'll win'.  If only!
1645 2018-02-03 19:46:01 tRump's infrastructure plan is for oil pipes.
1646 2018-02-03 19:45:57 @ChrisGPackham I don’t understand about the palm oil in #Sumatra - do we need to try and avoid it and reduce the effect on the rainforests there, or if we did would their lives suffer? Can we even avoid it in the UK?
1647 2018-02-03 19:45:53 Which one...the oil control carburetor, the grinder or the police scanner?
1648 2018-02-03 19:45:42 Lamp oil, rope, bombs you want it it's yours my friend as long as you have enough rupees
1649 2018-02-03 19:45:22 Bro...smelling French fries and hot oil for 8 hours will definitely make you wanna throw up
1650 2018-02-03 19:44:54 Charlie & I almost drove his car to get my car’s oil changed. We are not smart.
1651 2018-02-03 19:44:49 What is the ECONOMIC sense in FG locating a refinery in Katsina to refine Niger's 20,000 bpd oil when Nigeria already has non functional refineries, one of which is located in Kaduna unable to refine Nigeria's >2M bpd oil?
1652 2018-02-03 19:44:48 How much oil was spilled by those pipelines? 10000 gallons? 100000?
1653 2018-02-03 19:44:35 3 assists in one game @HenrikhMkh u absolute beauty... Oil can take day offs and we might not notice #Arsenal

1655 2018-02-03 19:44:28 UPDATE from HRC Saudi Arabia: “Instead of money, perhaps we can offer something else. Saudia Arabia is rich in oil, and the US is rich in arms…”
1656 2018-02-03 19:44:20 the differential is bad for the oil industry, Alberta and the country. That's why the federal government has approved Kinder Morgan. That's why it's going to be built.
1657 2018-02-03 19:44:16 The dossier was created by the Russians. There is some truth in like Russia is a coutry and that  Carter Page is a person. The dosseir would make you beileve that Page a blooming idiot would be given 19% of the shares in a major oil company.
1658 2018-02-03 19:43:42 You see that onye ofe mmanu you said ehn,I knew the meaning a long time ago clearly because you guys are fond of referring to yoruba people as that because we like oil on our soup...I stated the truth,I am not and never will be tribalistic I have too many lands to sell,later!
1659 2018-02-03 19:43:36 You dip your toes in oil grease
1660 2018-02-03 19:43:13 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1661 2018-02-03 19:43:01 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
1662 2018-02-03 19:42:56 09 was less lengthy decline in the price of oil compared to the current trough. That pro business government didn't deliver pipe to the west coast. We are living with their inaction.
1663 2018-02-03 19:42:55 Oh my yonce braids but just oil and i deep condition before
1664 2018-02-03 19:42:55 Look at map again and try to digest it fully! When Indy comes those jobs down south arelisy along with revenue and that will decimate Wangland! Oil companies givebtax breaks for decommissioning, the made enough profit why? Oh yes to put down indy voters!
1665 2018-02-03 19:42:38 Sam: So is that oil for food or for your hair?

he's getting there
1666 2018-02-03 19:42:31 I work in the oil industry. Shut your trap. You’ll be disappointed if the impass is broken and the pipeline goes forward. Admit it. Harper had 10 years and did zero. #cdnpoli
1667 2018-02-03 19:42:26 Getting my oil changed AND MY CAR WASHED. IM DOING BIG THIS TODAY!
1668 2018-02-03 19:42:24 Gil, perhaps you haven't been paying attention. Since BC NDP came to power, @jkenney raised idea of ending hydro purchases, tolling BC natural gas, & if necessary, periodically cutting off oil to Vancouver. Your Premier mocked him for it, said all was well. Now caught off guard.
1669 2018-02-03 19:42:24 Here's what I don't understand about the Russian collusion story: What were the Russians hoping to get out of a Trump victory? The Russian oligarchs get almost all of their $ from oil and Trump's policies would lower the price. It's counterintuitive
1670 2018-02-03 19:42:17 @jamieoliver just watching Friday Night on catchup and love the cannelloni recipe. But why use local nettles and 3 types of British cheese then drizzle olive oil. There are so many great local rapeseed oil producers you are definitely missing a trick.
1671 2018-02-03 19:41:58 Chill you lads, he will be back to Stamford Bridge after baldy leaves the oil well

You're willfully not paying attention

1685 2018-02-03 19:40:00 Y’all should maybe fix our crumbling roads, terrible public transportation, lack of clean drinking water, and about 1560 of things before you push for more pollution from fossil fuels and oil spills on the last few slivers of native land. Go ahead though congratulate yourself
1686 2018-02-03 19:39:46 politely asked to leave the skincare aisle at whole foods for repeatedly referring to jojoba oil as "yo momma oil"
1687 2018-02-03 19:39:39 Best place to get a oil change ?
1688 2018-02-03 19:39:24 Me: wears rosemary oil                 Random person walking in front of me: ooh I smell some ginger. 
1689 2018-02-03 19:39:23 Technically illegal aliens are constituents as they are counted in determining representation even though they have no vote. Not right.

1695 2018-02-03 19:38:55 Adding fry oil to this list... should be top three. Worst scar I have.
1696 2018-02-03 19:38:48 Lmao my dad bought my mom some CBD oil to vape...wtf 
1697 2018-02-03 19:38:38 Please look for Al Naimi while you’re in Saudi!
1698 2018-02-03 19:38:30 Waiting on my oil change. I put it off too long so I’m bracing myself for a scolding.
1699 2018-02-03 19:38:25 These aren't estimates they are actual numbers. So I guess the UK isn't raping us of our oil revenues after all, there ain't any.
1700 2018-02-03 19:38:18 How is building oil pipelines helping with our infrastructure? We need massive amounts of work done on our roads and bridges, power grids, and underground piping systems!
1701 2018-02-03 19:38:16 Premier league is farmer league.  Only first teams are good because of oil money ...
1702 2018-02-03 19:38:02 Do we need lay on hands and use oil???
1703 2018-02-03 19:38:01 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
1704 2018-02-03 19:37:39 So where do we draw the Line of  something like "Cloud Seeding" and "Act of GOD".... These Oil Pigs and Church Elites are NOT GODS!!!! But they Get away with crimes that affects all of us to put more $ in der pockets Daily, Colder the Temp, Higher our Energy bills.
1705 2018-02-03 19:37:39 The Shea moisture coconut oil product line has been a life saver with this blonde in my hair. 

I haven’t had all the extra work to keep my hair moisturized like I typically have to do when my hair is blonde.
1706 2018-02-03 19:37:38 I think we should expand the oil sands to 10 times the size.
1707 2018-02-03 19:37:15 Dealerships have the best oil.
1708 2018-02-03 19:37:04 Not even close to true. Frum came off as knowledgeable and you came off as a snake oil salesman  .

1712 2018-02-03 19:36:31 Oil change at Walmart at the beginning of the month.. horrible horrible idea
1713 2018-02-03 19:36:16 Since 2008-09 UK oil and gas revenues have fallen from £12.4 billion (0.8 per cent of GDP) to close to zero in 2015-16. The fall in receipts has been driven by falling production, much lower oil and gas prices and higher tax-deductible expenditure. Couldn't be any clearer,
1714 2018-02-03 19:36:02 Lol ohh so this is the caster oil! Wow  am such an embarrassment shame. I've only head about it, mom would threaten me with it aphinde athi she doesn't like it. I guess her mom used it a lot to her
1715 2018-02-03 19:35:52 Them smoothies I b making b STRAIGHT oil
1716 2018-02-03 19:35:36 Right, because showing that we're consuming more oil means we AREN'T conauming green energy? Logical fallacy.
1717 2018-02-03 19:35:24 For clarity, in petroleum and natural gas extraction, a Christmas tree, or "tree", is an assembly of valves, spools, and fittings used for an oil well, gas well, water injection well, water disposal well, gas injection well, condensate well and other types of wells
1718 2018-02-03 19:34:48 This hot oil treatment did wonders to my hair 
1719 2018-02-03 19:34:42 As trump and zinke want to sell ours to oil and gas
trump turning America backwards
1720 2018-02-03 19:34:35 Oil think of something more on point.
1721 2018-02-03 19:34:34 Finally got an oil change praiseeee
1722 2018-02-03 19:34:32 Isnt it wierd that biddens son is on the board of ukrains biggest oil company....
1723 2018-02-03 19:34:19 If the Fed. Gov. wants to see refining capacity in Katsina state, which it does, then the oil to feed that refinery will come from oil fields in Niger (120 kms away) and not from Niger Delta (1,200 kms away). The Dangote refinery is in Lekki. We're talking about Katsina State.
1724 2018-02-03 19:34:17 Wanna buy it? Model needs to change but is doable. 2 plants close by that can provide the oil..
1725 2018-02-03 19:34:11 If your castor oil not thicker than a bowl of oatmeal don’t stink it’s not legit
1726 2018-02-03 19:34:08 That is simply paying big oil even more money and endangering the environment.  How about starting with crumbling bridges and roads?
1727 2018-02-03 19:34:00 もし男性であることである程度の攻撃性を持って生まれるとしてもそれにトッピングで更に「人殺しの性質」を生まれもったって言ってんのよ フラペチーノが人間性でエクストラホイップが男性の攻撃性で追加ソースが殺人鬼力よ
1728 2018-02-03 19:33:48 Yeah we were going in as soon as that torch turned off  but that’s back in like 2011 before a lot of people even knew what oil was or just heard about it and nobody knew anything about it yet like they do now. Mike tried putting that kid on but we thought he died  Good times
1729 2018-02-03 19:33:30 Can someone please tell us what that means for oil and Gold prices for next week?! 
1730 2018-02-03 19:33:16 Those are good things? So we can expect more oil spills and watch our national monuments being mined? Ok....
1731 2018-02-03 19:33:10 My essential oil collection keeps growing 
1732 2018-02-03 19:32:51 their fries are def good cause they use beef lard instead of veggie oil, but to me their burgers taste just as deathly as in the US haha
1733 2018-02-03 19:32:40 I swear one day I’m just going to move to Alaska and live off the land. It’s big enough that even the oil guys could be hundreds of miles away
1734 2018-02-03 19:32:36 Oil burner
1735 2018-02-03 19:32:33 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
1736 2018-02-03 19:32:32 Changed the oil in the cars I can relax
1737 2018-02-03 19:32:16 Best part of game was after Micki's third assist OIl clapping it. He would feel there is someone besides him and Wilshere who is Creative and can find a pass. #Arsenal #LMAO
1738 2018-02-03 19:32:14 The Trump Russia conspiracy runs deeply into the GOP. And as Bannon said, it’s all about money laundering. Russian money funneled through the RNC and Wikileaks spread directly by Trump and the lapdog media. To end sanctions and open Russian arctic oil.
1739 2018-02-03 19:32:06 karen why are you calling me oil
1740 2018-02-03 19:32:01 Don't sound like Judas and the alabaster oil woman .. Find out how Judas sounded and what Jesus told Judas in response !
1741 2018-02-03 19:31:56 Y’all protest oil and capitalism by driving your cars to protests and buying protest merch, and you protest animal slaughtering but love eating bacon for breakfast. Americans are funny as hell
1742 2018-02-03 19:31:55 Lol at my life. Go to get an oil change, car needs $1600 worth of work. Not including tires.
1743 2018-02-03 19:31:52 Love it. No reason big oil can't be it big wind.....a dollars a dollar
1744 2018-02-03 19:31:45 My hair feels so much better after the coconut oil treatment. I think I’m going to do this at least once a week but next time I’ll sleep with it in over night and wash it out.  #coconutoil #haircare
1745 2018-02-03 19:31:26 The guy changing my oil just asked if it was the new Taylor Swift album I was playing  

Yes sir it was and thank you
1746 2018-02-03 19:31:13 Yep I take Krill oil tablets only 2  I take horrible! 
1747 2018-02-03 19:31:07 Death count so far?
1748 2018-02-03 19:31:05 So where do we draw the Line of  something like "Cloud Seeding" and "Act of GOD".... These Oil Pigs and Church Elites are NOT GODS!!!! But they Get away with crimes that affects all of us to put more $ in der pockets Daily, Colder the Temp, Higher our Energy bills.
1749 2018-02-03 19:30:56 Oil changes take forever 
1750 2018-02-03 19:30:40 Getting this oil change then it’s time

1752 2018-02-03 19:30:38 Oil changed and tires rotated. Hammy is in good health, but will need some new front brakes and tires within the next six months. They even took care of the steering recall that was announced only days after I bought it. XD
1753 2018-02-03 19:30:37 The way to measure the governments effects would be this hypothetical. If Oil was at $80 or $90 dollars per barrel like it averaged over the 10 years before they were elected, how much investment would there be?
1754 2018-02-03 19:30:34 In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has.
1755 2018-02-03 19:30:14 Very true sir and the irony is that neither the borrowing rate came down to the level which can boost the economy and now we will see rate hikes soon . Big opportunity missed when oil was around 40-50 $
1756 2018-02-03 19:30:00 Peppermint Oil Benefit: Peppermint contains rosmarinic acid (also found in rosemary), which may help to reduce inflammation-causing chemicals in people with asthma.
1757 2018-02-03 19:29:59 Good luck!
1758 2018-02-03 19:29:42 Mix some minced meat up with chopped onions chopped coriander salt, chilli powder, add any spices you like, cumin powder to taste.. add oil in pan and add meat and cook. Can add peas or sweet corn if you want or potatoes. Use this as a filling
1759 2018-02-03 19:29:41 He can spray that oil sheen all over 
1760 2018-02-03 19:29:39 Theirs riots going on in Russia all the time now and we don't see much of it on the mainstream news. but I read about it on the AP from time to time or it could be coming from the oil company's they are very powerful in the media still. Oil also plays a big role in this.
1761 2018-02-03 19:29:39 Shoutout my mom who got me an oil diffuser so my room doesn't smell like someone's been furiously masturbating in it several times a day since puberty began
1762 2018-02-03 19:29:38 The colusion of the refineries to set the price of fuel is the dirt that should be calling people to question why... Price of oil has nothing to do with fuel prices.
1763 2018-02-03 19:29:26 I have a BMW so I had to buy the oil and stuff myself cuz thy don’t carry that kind, the oil itself was 50 bucks
1764 2018-02-03 19:29:21 いやオメー大多数そうなってないじゃん！大多数がそうなってない→そうなる要素を持ち合わせて生まれた→先天性の人殺しって言ってんよ僕
話題デリケートすぎてリプ返せねぇよこれリプで反論していいのかなわかんねぇよ……
1765 2018-02-03 19:29:07 true BUT with possibility that a barrel of oil hits $100, you just giving big oil that extra money.
1766 2018-02-03 19:29:04 Thank you, I’ve had a couple Oilatum reccs so will give it a go. Using a French no-soap baby bath oil as well. It’s fucking shit and looks so sore :(
1767 2018-02-03 19:28:51 Oh, it was Rosneft ... you know, a gigantic Russian criminal enterprise selling oil. Want to debate that assessment?
1768 2018-02-03 19:28:44 Nigeria even loses about $1bn to oil bukering. Imagine all the good that could have been done with that money.
1769 2018-02-03 19:28:41 What action??? You mean using foreign steel and oil spills? #STFU
1770 2018-02-03 19:28:40 Sorry things are bad in your industry. I know my friends and family in the industry have felt it to. The reality is the last time oil collapsed like it did starting in 14 was the 80s.
1771 2018-02-03 19:28:18 @RichardTrumka just a common guy hanging with truck drivers BBQing ribs and drinking beer. 
1772 2018-02-03 19:28:17 I could probably do with taking some vitamin supplements myself Kate. I even thought about getting some cod liver oil last week! Not sure why. I remember my mom used to make me have a spoonful every day before school when I was a kid. I hated the stuff

1777 2018-02-03 19:27:42 Why tf is coconut oil so expensive 
1778 2018-02-03 19:27:39 Beard shampoo prices have gotten ridiculous! I bet I could mix head&shoulders, coconut oil, and haldi and flip it for extreme cash at a Berkeley farmers market
1779 2018-02-03 19:27:39 We are sorry for our ingratitude Mr DauraEngr. It is noise of many generators and smog from years of  oil drills that makes us sensitive to Daura-level incompetence.

Imagine ordinary Daura-level incompetence and they are shouting!

Allah bless your Daura-level incompetence
1780 2018-02-03 19:27:18 You bring up a good point, we can't even ship our products to eastern Canada. eg. no Energy East pipeline, so Saudi Arabia can sell Eastern Canada their oil. Thoughts?
1781 2018-02-03 19:26:51 My coconut oil for my hair spilt all through my bag, all over all my makeup, & all over my new shoes that i haven’t even worn yet, so that’s how my days going (:

1784 2018-02-03 19:26:23 Whatever happened to the supply glut? Oil tankers sitting offshore.  Over-production? I am not an expert, just wondering if crude at $65 is priced right. Is the Dollar's weakness the only driver of the current price?
1785 2018-02-03 19:26:15 Y'all we're protesting off shore oil drilling rn and a sea lion just came up to our crowd to say hello, if that ain't a good sign idk what is :')

1802 2018-02-03 19:24:00 The canned crickets I had last night looked like little pellets, so I think those would be more accessible to a new eater. But the crickets I had in Thailand were a delicacy of a visiting tribe, they just looked like bugs tossed in a skillet with oil and seasoning.
1803 2018-02-03 19:23:52 I put coconut oil on Cody to soothe his skin, but he’s just sitting in the corner licking it off 
1804 2018-02-03 19:23:42 Yes use our oil.The middle east is drying up move forward
1805 2018-02-03 19:23:40 Who wants to go take my car for an oil change and a brake check? I’ll give you a really nice hug as a thank you.
1806 2018-02-03 19:23:40 Im pretty sure I clean my purse out as often as I get an oil change because that’s what I do while I wait...
1807 2018-02-03 19:23:27 Yes.  The Zinc Oxide is worse than sand, but not nearly as bad as burning paint, wooden railroad ties, heaven help us if the locomotive goes up (all sorts of plastics, hydraulic fluid, oil, coolant, diesel fuel, etc...).

We're just blasé about the other risks...
1808 2018-02-03 19:23:09 Which is why Trump is thwarting Putin's imperial ambitions at every turn and destroying the Russian economy by keeping the price of oil and gas line. Deference should be made of sterner stuff.
1809 2018-02-03 19:23:04 No lol ... obviously I was wearing a shirt the oil splash onto me so it got burnt what does my shirt have to do with it it’s not like it protected me
1810 2018-02-03 19:23:00 Came for an oil change, leaving w/new rear brakes. #doiHAVEtostop?
1811 2018-02-03 19:22:44 Odd that you say “hopefully.. prove Nunes memo true”. You actually hope the DOJ/FBI misled these judges?? Why, because Carter Page is such a great American? You may want to read up on Page. He is a Putin apologist who hated sanctions that killed some of his Russian oil deal$.
1812 2018-02-03 19:22:42 Brought my car into get its oil changed and all my tools are in the back and now the salesman is tryna sell me a truck lol
1813 2018-02-03 19:22:41 Here I am thinking I’m just about to get an oil change, but I’m due for about a million different services  finna be here all day.
1814 2018-02-03 19:22:30 I can’t wait for the life changing experience of an oil change and a tank of gas and a 44oz fountain coke from Speedway. USA! USA!
1815 2018-02-03 19:22:17 Arsenal offensively looking fluid as oil! Unfortunately same goes for the porous defence. Regardless, we move! #COYG
1816 2018-02-03 19:21:57 Been at this place since 11:40 to get an oil change and my damn car still not in there
1817 2018-02-03 19:21:56 Rugby's over - back to boring culinary stuff:  fritto misto, chips (oven, because I failed to replenish oil), crushed peas. Question begs, whether to put garlic in the peas?  Will I be kissing anyone tomorrow?  Unlikely - so.....  garlic! 
1818 2018-02-03 19:21:52 Most of the oil stolen is majorly done in two ways

1819 2018-02-03 19:21:43 I'd pay to see you vs @ChrisRGun in Turkish Oil Wrestling.

1821 2018-02-03 19:21:33 CBD oil is growing fast now!
1822 2018-02-03 19:21:21 Like in Venezuela, a country with the worlds largest oil reserves in a he world, yet their citizens have no gasoline & no food, that’s socialism #sucks
1823 2018-02-03 19:20:43 Ya me cansé y ni a la oil llegué

1826 2018-02-03 19:20:37 Waiting for an oil change at Nissan dealership in Charleston, a guy catercorner from me is telling another guy in an Eagles hat how the Eagles are gonna lose tomorrow because of their Super Bowl experience, Tom Brady, and the refs. Dude in the hat is just smiling & listening.

1830 2018-02-03 19:20:07 Feck that map was clearly over your education limits! Next time I will send a coloring book! Can you explain why there was £8b oil from unknown sources! Ship to ship transfer oils by passing Scots ports good big to euro ports direct! Wake up buttercup!
1831 2018-02-03 19:19:55 Did you know that BP has approval to test drill for oil off the coast of #NovaScotia ? 

From the federal government.
1832 2018-02-03 19:19:42 I have trouble eating until the afternoon as well. Sometimes I'll do half an avocado with a drizzle of olive oil before I head out. That way I still get some good fats in to give my body something to metabolize, even if I'm not going to eat for a while.
1833 2018-02-03 19:19:38 Good side Burnley , you did well to get a draw , imaging what Dyche could do with oil money
1834 2018-02-03 19:19:35 So the RCA Dome was blown up when it was millions of dollars in debt and then taxes paid for 80% of Lucas Oil?
WHAT THE FUCK HOOSIERS, WHATTHEFUCK.
1835 2018-02-03 19:19:31 Had similar priority that of road building was given to rail track building & electrification, we would have been a self sufficient zero fuel import economy running on ONGC & Barmer oil.. 
but some people don't want that to happen. Mega conspiracies !!
1836 2018-02-03 19:19:27 I don’t even say “oil” normal anymore, I say it like @Laura88Lee says it 
1837 2018-02-03 19:19:17 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
1838 2018-02-03 19:19:15 This is great news!  The #NC delegation w/Speaker Moore are right to support offshore exploration.  We need to know what’s out there. Clean, natural gas is cheap & abundant.  Technology has made oil drilling safer & cleaner.#NationalSecurity #Brunsco

1839 2018-02-03 19:19:13 I rub in some hemp seed oil for my skin problems. helps with the inflammation.  high levels of vitamin E in it so it's good for your skin regardless of condition it's in. :)
1840 2018-02-03 19:19:01 I use flaxseed oil. Same thing as food grade linseed oil as both come from the flax plant. I buy it online from healthfood sites. It’s cheap and a couple years back I got a “5 pints for the price of 2” deal.

The site is Puritan’s Pride. Give it a shot.
1841 2018-02-03 19:18:54 21st of April . Halifax away . I will sulk if you don’t turn up in olive oil
1842 2018-02-03 19:18:50 He leads them in rebounds due to the fact no player stays with this franchise  >2years.Nets have been a disaster for decades..Lopez had some decent seasons but his injury history is that he plays 50 games per yr...if lucky..oh yeah reminds me of another Laker Olive Oil(Mr.Softee)
1843 2018-02-03 19:18:44 Facial oil has saved my face
1844 2018-02-03 19:18:37 Yeah good. Start w the Uranium One / Rosatom deal. Then move on to Gulf oil states. What was the title of that email again?  Backdoor meeting / Russian invite?  And typically as from @nytimes, unnamed sources.
1845 2018-02-03 19:18:30 @essentialdepot  What happen to the Argan Oil?
1846 2018-02-03 19:18:03 So presumably the same arguments will be in place for oil, so what I’m your life are you doing to ensure you don’t use any oil in February?
1847 2018-02-03 19:17:46 No worries. I’m in my Bob Ross class, oil painting—very relaxing!Thanks for caring
1848 2018-02-03 19:17:39 ....a serious oil/fuel crisis in the US. Becoming a major oil exporter isn’t how we make the US energy self-dependent. It’s how we are going to wreck our entire economy, leaving us in a dangerous situation when we will need those reserves most.
1849 2018-02-03 19:17:33 For the first time since 1970, U.S. crude oil production broke 10 million barrels a day. America’s “status is growing” as the world’s third largest oil producer, with production expected to expand. “The Trump administration has embraced energy as an economic force #maga #SOTU
1850 2018-02-03 19:17:19 ...yes....and a lotion with tea tree oil...

1852 2018-02-03 19:17:04 Aqueous cream to wash with? My sister used to get Balneum (sp) but not sure if prescribed - it was basically oil in the bath
1853 2018-02-03 19:16:53 A merchant vessel Marine Express (oil tanker), owned by Mumbai-based Anglo Eastern shipping company with 22 Indian nationals onboard, is presumably missing off the coast of Benin in the Gulf of Guinea.
1854 2018-02-03 19:16:36 Your getting off track, you said you want roads not oil, I say we need oil first to make the roads and be able to afford fuel so we can drive them.  I made no mention of who is going to build them
1855 2018-02-03 19:16:23 Okay but Moroccan Rose is my new favourite essential oil

1858 2018-02-03 19:15:58 I'd rather trust the tried & tested indian traditional way of cooking food. Mustard oil or coconut oil can never be bad

1861 2018-02-03 19:14:50 I don’t think it will need any more oil for a while 
1862 2018-02-03 19:14:44 @Dollarlogic Why don't I watch PBS anymore? The litany of "I'm not OK and it's all your fault" & "It's Your Parent's Fault Your Ass Has It's Own Zip Code" sideshows. PBS become little more than a carnival midway for these snake oil salesman. Eat a donut and STFU.

OIL！
1874 2018-02-03 19:13:35 Sorry to spoil your fantasy but this year tax revenues from oil were just £200 million. The Scottish government alone spends £65B. Thankfully the UK stepped in to support the industry with new tax breaks when oil fell to sub $40.
1875 2018-02-03 19:13:33 what's wrong? do you use magnesium oil transdermally? it helps me.

1883 2018-02-03 19:12:01 More leftist propaganda bull. They assted pot with blacks and hisps to play on the already xenophobic contrlng white elite.but the reason it was outlawed was so they could ban hemp too...the hemp separting machine made it so hemp wld replace the paper, oil, and textile industries
1884 2018-02-03 19:12:01 “We get to change the oil on a GT350!!!”
1885 2018-02-03 19:11:51 Something people aren’t talking about, Trump is selling off US oil reserves to foreign companies. This is why gas prices are rising. Our oil reserves are being depleted for profit. If we get into a large scale war, we will need the oil we no longer have and it will create...

1893 2018-02-03 19:10:42 Saudi Arabia - basically ISIS, but with a slightly better PR operation and more oil.
1894 2018-02-03 19:10:42 That's good to hear you're not against sustainable changes. My problem with your statement is that it implies a person needs to be an eco-saint before any dissent is allowed. Also, pipelines are not the only solution to reducing reliance on foreign oil.
1895 2018-02-03 19:10:35 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
1896 2018-02-03 19:10:31 Good idea, when I worked in a kitchen & we spilled oil we put salt down

1905 2018-02-03 19:09:49 And also not because Nutella is full of palm oil 
1906 2018-02-03 19:09:49 it’s 2018 yallll.. self care is so damn imperative!! idk how else to stress it. feed that mind, that soul with the good stuff—care for that bod. get a facial. bathe in coconut oil. read a book. pray and connect with God. stay hydrated. focus on yourself first! love yourself! 
1907 2018-02-03 19:09:48 Do you need a receipt to take stuff back at Walmart ? Bought wrong oil and don’t have it lol

1909 2018-02-03 19:09:34 Yeah so it can break and leak thousands of gallons of oil into the ground polluting lakes, rivers and drinking water! Your so awesome & great that you would risk the lives of common people, wildlife & livestock to help your rich oil friends get richer!

1911 2018-02-03 19:09:19 Yay my first oil change is free
1912 2018-02-03 19:09:02 Bridport IS lovely but that's fairly shabby, they could keep the odd oil filled radiator under the stairs for such an eventuality. Hope you got a decent breakfast!
1913 2018-02-03 19:09:00 Interesting fact. The seat held by Debbie Dingell was created in 1932. Has been held by a Dingell ever since. .

1917 2018-02-03 19:08:38 I thought Scotland was bad until I got told by a Portuguese guy that its govt signed over oil rights in the Algarve sea and on land for 20 cents on the barrel.

Theres bent , and then theres bent.
1918 2018-02-03 19:08:34 At my Grandmas house. House to myself bouta eat some food do my homework/emails deep conditioning hot oil treatment all that!
1919 2018-02-03 19:08:25 This is right up there with "let them eat cake" 
Time to oil the guillotines.
1920 2018-02-03 19:08:24 Laying pipes in the desert will be cheaper than in the swampy and rainforest.
Cost of producing crude oil in saudi is less than $15. In Nigeria ,over $20.
Do the maths
1921 2018-02-03 19:08:21 The buffet is amazing I use it too!! I also have the caffein eye serum, one of the primers, and the rosehip oil. I’m so impressed with their quality for the price. Plus the aesthetic lol
1922 2018-02-03 19:08:18 I’m 99.98% sure that whoever changed the oil on my car at the Plainfield @AndyMohrChevy stole my iPhone aux adapter. That’s petty, man.
1923 2018-02-03 19:08:09 So we want to buy crude oil from Niger republic? I really don't understand the thought process at aso rock, national assembly, these guys are simply a disgrace for this.
1924 2018-02-03 19:07:49 เหมือนกันเลยค่ะ
1925 2018-02-03 19:07:45 It was amazing, tbh. It was very similar to NYC pizza, but a lot less oil and a lot less sauce.
1926 2018-02-03 19:07:39 Belongs to a wood and oil stove
1927 2018-02-03 19:07:34 It is. Especially as it was infamous for woeful mpg. Being barely any faster than a stock t sport and no-one ever servicing the supercharger oil. And also the klubersynth oil required cost more than your average Faberge egg.

1929 2018-02-03 19:06:57 Magic oil, that vivishine. 

1930 2018-02-03 19:06:46 For UPA Time the petrol was almost similar to what it is today! Little bit +|- with subsidy’s but all oil cos were making huge loss now oil cos are self sustained and with excise duty earning govt making infrastructure facilities making less consumption of oil/KM.
1931 2018-02-03 19:06:44 You know what else sucks? The oil & gas industry can economically clean frack water to reuse or return to the water shed. But they’d rather use trucks to inject toxic waste water into wells. Why?
1932 2018-02-03 19:06:25 Hence I said 'at most' it is dependant on global oil prices.
1933 2018-02-03 19:06:12 It is crude and products? What part of this falling in OECD because of skyrocketing post hurricane in US export of oil and products?
1934 2018-02-03 19:06:09 Letting oil companies build a pipeline is not infrastructure. That would be roads and bridges and power grids and the like.
1935 2018-02-03 19:06:07 I lost my lip balm and my backup lip balm so im using coconut oil instead lmao
1936 2018-02-03 19:06:07 Louisiana and Texas have developed the infrastructure to handle oil and gas operations over decades. The demands on small ocean towns in NC would be too much. There are also not enough experienced people to operate safely and efficiently with Zinke’s plans across the US.
1937 2018-02-03 19:06:00 Sitting At the dealer for an hour and a half just waiting for an oil change... fml! At least my family was here for the same thing and kept me company! 
1938 2018-02-03 19:05:55 Is it a thermostat or whatever for an oil stove or a wood and oil stove?

1940 2018-02-03 19:05:50 Now what on earth would give him that stupid idea!

Removing a leader who ensured his people has homes, healthcare , education purchased with a good part of the country's oil wealth?

Removing him was to cripple the power of Libya and steal its gold.
1941 2018-02-03 19:05:41 Ask the citizens of Flint how they feel about lead water, or those who lost homes thanks to natural gas drilling, loss of wildlife from oil spills! The loss of national park space for oil! This is nothing short of rape of our planet from those who don't give a shit!
1942 2018-02-03 19:05:32 Same here. It was especially disheartening to learn of the Russian tanker docked in Boston. Gas/oil -- Under the radar trade? Just a travesty

1949 2018-02-03 19:04:51 Well you’d think if we are going to sell our souls our National Parks for oil & gas then all that  should at least be funneled back into the parks & forests @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @RogerWilliamsTX

2031 2018-02-03 18:55:28 @subaru_usa thanks for making it near impossible for someone with normal size hands to change the turn signal bulb. And having to feed my car a qt of oil every 1k mi is a huge bonus! #WontButAnother
2032 2018-02-03 18:55:19 I have an essential oil obsession. I have at least 100 and make my one blends. Bergamot and lavender is my jam. Sometimes I add neroli or ylang ylang into it too.

2036 2018-02-03 18:54:23 Drugs, guns, oil, meat, consciousness, life...none of these are the problem. Short sight, oversight, inconsistency is the problem. The bigger the world, the more support required. For the support to work, it has to be active and balanced - when it is, the support is just & right.
2037 2018-02-03 18:54:18 Do you realize that the very roads you talk of needed are made with crude oil, and the machines making the roads run on petroleum products, made from you guessed it OIL.
2038 2018-02-03 18:54:11 It’s only 2pm and so far I’ve volunteered for 3 hours, took my car to the mechanic and currently am getting an oil change for the car my parents have been letting me drive. PRODUCTIVE AM I RIGHT
2039 2018-02-03 18:53:59 Hair gel (the black type) .... I used a little coconut oil but it was the gel that made the baby hair the way it is in the pic
2040 2018-02-03 18:53:55 On the off-days, I use IGK smoke and mirrors which is a cleansing oil. That has made a HUGE difference. I think you have to use really good hair dye, and frequent trims as well
2041 2018-02-03 18:53:51 It certainly was Sinisalo and the glove stop he made on Howe at the end of the sequence pictured still gives me chills.
2042 2018-02-03 18:53:28 Not exactly correct. I believe the Alberta plan announced in late 2015 involved a negotiated increase in oil sands production,  but with a cap, in exchange for carbon pricing etc.
2043 2018-02-03 18:53:25 I've gone from cutting steel for making oil rigs to cutting wood for making houses, over the last 20 odd years. Shift work never gets any easier.

2056 2018-02-03 18:51:19 I’m not for or against the pipeline or the tax. The latter, as long as it’s used for the right purposes, investment in green technology and the eventually of closing the tar sands and moving off oil as a basis for energy.

2127 2018-02-03 18:42:37 Maybe a ship to ship transfer in mind ? Could SANCHI explosion have been S2S transfer/black market bunkering gone wrong? Rhine barges used to play that game with gas oil cargoes sold in quiet backwaters as bunker fuel. Probably still do ;-)
2128 2018-02-03 18:42:22 So WM hiding scots wealth then deciding to take 92% of it leaving scots with 8% of their own oil and gas revenue,then the lies told to win in 2014,then EU vote ignored,,this is the reality of unionism,its about propping up england
2129 2018-02-03 18:42:04 My hair know it can suck up some oil 
2130 2018-02-03 18:41:58 Ha! That's EXACTLY how I describe myself. The Tin Man with no oil, but yoga oils me up.
2131 2018-02-03 18:41:55 Frizzy hair? Coconut oil. No shaving cream? Coconut oil. Dry skin? Coconut oil. Bad grades? Coconut oil. Significant other acting up? Coconut oil. Stressful week? Coconut oil.
2132 2018-02-03 18:41:47 I think about that with the essential oil bottle on my nightstand. 
2133 2018-02-03 18:41:35 Hi ria try a steam inhalation, you would place one to two drops of eucalyptus essential oil in a bowl of hot water.
2134 2018-02-03 18:41:18 You have to be very careful about essential oil sourcing. If the oil was ever stored in a plastic bin it is probably contaminated with phthalates.  #shiftcon
2135 2018-02-03 18:41:13 Fossil fuels and information can create market-rocking value together to the extent that oil & gas companies invest in energy storage and “smart grid” / “smart cities” technology plays. It’s all part of one big supply chain! GE is on top of this.
2136 2018-02-03 18:40:46 A private citizen can do that. No worse than al gore and occidental oil, he got a yearly check from them while being VP and sold fed protected lands for them to drill on.
2137 2018-02-03 18:40:41 Roads, bridges, railways airports are infrastructure. The pipeline is nothing more than another gift to big oil. How much more Native American land and our natural resources do you want to destroy? Greed and corruption will be your nemesis.
2138 2018-02-03 18:40:32 Trump's views re climate are clearly bizarre. So here is an out- of- the - box thought:  Trump wants to promote fossil fuels that benefit Putin.  We know Trump is competitive and greedy. Maybe he hopes to do an oil deal with Putin & Saudis that will make Trump a zillionaire !
2139 2018-02-03 18:40:28 SHIP MORE OIL TO ASIA!!! THAT WILL FIX IT!
2140 2018-02-03 18:40:27 Abu Dhabi: the Upper Zakum oil field's production capacity will reach 1 million barrels per day by 2024
2141 2018-02-03 18:40:25 Girls are asleep, tim went to get the oil changed. Peace and quiet for once. 
2142 2018-02-03 18:40:21 #solo @solooilgas     Want exposure to Helium? Multi TCF Gas resources? UK Oil?

Solo oil (SOLO) Mkt Cap £16 Million Risked NAV for gas asset alone over £100 Million......
2143 2018-02-03 18:40:13 i love lavender oil more then anything :’)
2144 2018-02-03 18:40:11 I’m all for peace in the Middle East but I’m wondering why an SC state senator from a poor-if-not-for-tourism district is there now. Seems he should be home fighting with Gov McMaster against Trump’s move to drill offshore. One oil spill & his hometown is wrecked
2145 2018-02-03 18:40:10 So if unionism lives up to that why the fuck do half scots voters want independence?
ITS ABOUT THE OIL as you`ll soon see when WM triess to keep it if we vote indy,your loyalty is seen as weakness,they dont care about scots just the resources
2146 2018-02-03 18:40:09 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
2147 2018-02-03 18:40:03 How much coal and oil is required to make a solar panel, from cradle to grave?  Keep in mind, machines, worker transportation,  heavy equipment, dump trucks... all use oil to make panels.
2148 2018-02-03 18:39:53 Sure did come to get an oil change in my house slippers...  oh pregnancy brain
2149 2018-02-03 18:39:28  short EUR, long DXY, short GLD/SLV/GDX, short oil. Dollar runs over all of them

2151 2018-02-03 18:39:17 if you use less oil and that.
2152 2018-02-03 18:39:06 I get that some of yall are super holistic, I really do. I've tried shea butter I've tried olive oil, and I felt like a damn greased up chicken. My preference is coconut oil. Its basic, it's light, and i've seen the best results when using it.
2153 2018-02-03 18:39:05 Here's to the on-line ones. The overs. The cankerworms. The ileitis. The unbarreled oil shales in the assertive metallics.
2154 2018-02-03 18:39:04 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
2155 2018-02-03 18:39:03 First in oil!
2156 2018-02-03 18:38:59 One of my friends is in the city this weekend. I'll be going on chai tapri meet up with him tomorrow at 8am. This is happening for the first time in my life. I have coconut oil in my hair. Winter mornings are lovely here. I am very excited.
2157 2018-02-03 18:38:57 Quick run for this oil filter
2158 2018-02-03 18:38:34 I need help from a real man. Someone help me change the oil in my car please.
2159 2018-02-03 18:38:29 Black Mirror S:5 E:1 Coconut Oil 
Me, Saturday morning, running a mile and a half.
2160 2018-02-03 18:38:24 It will take days of sanding to get all of the orange oil off the desk in the oval office.
2161 2018-02-03 18:38:23 .@oil_products Many thanks for following
2162 2018-02-03 18:38:09 Don't sound like Judas and the alabaster oil woman ...
2163 2018-02-03 18:37:54 I cooked it in rapeseed oil, salt & pepper, some sultanas & sesame seeds .... LUSH 
2164 2018-02-03 18:37:49 Is a tune up and an oil change the same??
2165 2018-02-03 18:37:45 @POTUS Typical misdirection, you forgot to mention the oil spills that they have incurred already.  What we really need are roads, bridges, electrical grids, airports, and railroads.  Oh, and NO border walls are needed or wanted by most Americans.
2166 2018-02-03 18:37:45 LIAR  ...... Infrastructure projects are roads & bridges.... not eco disasters for foreign oil.
2167 2018-02-03 18:37:43 then decided to take the two twins so they all had homes. I've had them since they were 8 weeks, and now they're 10 years old! They are rarely sick, with only one vet visit in 10 years for sickness. *knocks wood* I'm intrigued by the Eucalyptus oil idea. I love Eucalyptus (con't)

2170 2018-02-03 18:37:29 everyone has different skin. therefore, different oils work better on different skin types. Coconut oil works great on my skin. Please do not tell me I should use something different. I have fairly normal skin that sometimes gets a little dry.
2171 2018-02-03 18:37:26 These old niggas in churches smell like motor oil & ice houses
2172 2018-02-03 18:37:25 FYI, pipelines are NOT infrastructure. Pipelines are for transporting oil for corporate profit, and not for general public use. NOT INFRASTRUCTURE.
2173 2018-02-03 18:37:25 I wash my face. I have a Clarisonic Mia, one of those electronic scrubbers. I only use it for makeup removal. And use it with a basic oil free Neutrogena face wash. put on some Aveeno lotion and take my ass to bed.
2174 2018-02-03 18:37:11 若林だけに
2175 2018-02-03 18:37:10 Jeff Oh dear! So sorry to hear you have all had such a bad day. 
At the end of the day it could have been worse honest. Before you refill it are you sure your oil tank has not got a leak?
#ZSHQ
2176 2018-02-03 18:37:10 Very absurd to compare, specially with valuation compared to earnings. Besides, 2008 was a global crisis, that was a huge swing, can't be taken out n oil prices, massive inflation impacted UPA II heavily.
Market is not economy of a country !! 
Where else to invest now !!
2177 2018-02-03 18:37:04 "Fastest oil change on the planet." First true tagline I've ever seen. #truestory #impressive @Take5_OilChange
2178 2018-02-03 18:37:01 Mild drama. Husband managed to set fire to a baking tray of oil under the grill (he forgot the grill was still on...) actual flames!! Sorted with 3 wet tea towels and we know the smoke alarm works. Might look into buying a fire blanket for the kitchen 
2179 2018-02-03 18:36:49 The world could have been rid of fossil fuels a long time ago if it wasn’t for the fact that the oil companies deliberately sabotaged any attempts to develop alternative sources. Its all about the money. There are many horror stories about people that tried to go against oil.
2180 2018-02-03 18:36:39 You can cut back on oil and do that then.
2181 2018-02-03 18:36:31 Lady at Safeway damn near made me pass out, as she REEKED of patchouli. Instead of bathing in an essential oil, please try bathing with soap and water.
2182 2018-02-03 18:36:23 With luck, Trump industries will be there drilling for oil before mid-term elections.  And by luck, I mean stupidity.
2183 2018-02-03 18:36:18 Alaskans own 229,370 shares of MCDERMOTT INTERNATIONAL INC, worth $1,548,248. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in PANAMA.
2184 2018-02-03 18:36:14 She should have worked harder and become an oil exec, then she could afford to buy her own Costco.
2185 2018-02-03 18:36:02 I got something like 21 of these AMAZING face masks in Amsterdam. So excited to try them all. Currently got on a peach oil and mango butter mud mask.
2186 2018-02-03 18:35:54 at the studio and i ate a half box of 2 month old triscuits but they were cracked pepper and olive oil so i enjoyed every second
2187 2018-02-03 18:35:53 Oh yea right! Make more money for Ottawa to funnel into Quebec. Then when there is a spill and we say who is going to clean this up and where was your "billion dollar world class oil repsonse procedures" We will get, well that was an old government and you are on your own.
2188 2018-02-03 18:35:48 Yes! Dems need to be branded, called out, replaced. I borrowed a term from a Ajamu Bakara:
#TheSoftRight 
The center right needs to be exposed for what it is: the party of fracking, Big Oil, big Pharma, Wall Street
2189 2018-02-03 18:35:40 It looks like d presence of mikhi has liberated Oil couple with d effort of iwobi. Dere is less burden on him to be d chief assister
2190 2018-02-03 18:35:35 It helps big motor, which helps big oil, which in turn helps that idiot in the White House.
2191 2018-02-03 18:35:34 Sure is! I cringe thinking about the years I spent on the sun with no sunscreen...or worse “laying out” with baby oil. 
2192 2018-02-03 18:35:29 He’s a rent seeker Steve. Has POW for oil changed much. Or even gold. Not really. Quite frankly he doesn’t understand what POW is. Bitcoin is v.3 not v.1. You are mining the internet not earth. And thanks for your contributions
2193 2018-02-03 18:35:16 How about all of that oil spilled due to that pipeline, eh?
2194 2018-02-03 18:35:16 @asda
What a waste of time ,put in order and get half of it substituted. Order 5 litres of oil but get sent 4 litres  but still charged for 5 litres will never use again
2195 2018-02-03 18:35:09 Ask those digging out from MASSIVE OIL SPILLAGE IN THE STATES' PIPELINE PATH, how they FEEL ABOUT THAT????
2196 2018-02-03 18:34:48 Now that oil prices have rebounded a bit, Exxon's just returning its investment plan to the $10 bil/ year that it averaged before they tanked. But they're spinning it as a result of the GOP's awful tax plan. It's pretty transparent propaganda, but the media's lapping it up.
2197 2018-02-03 18:34:42 putting rose oil over my face feels so damn good
2198 2018-02-03 18:34:41 To me, it's a yes and a no. It all depends on why you're vegan & where the palm oil is sourced. If you're vegan for the animals or planet then it isn't vegan unless you buy ethical & sustainable palm oil. There are plenty of companies that use it ethically, just gotta research!
2199 2018-02-03 18:34:38 I think that’s their endgame, tbh. Look at Kansas - essentially defunded education via tax cuts, oil industry stepped in, kids now get cute cartoon propaganda about how great oil drilling is.
2200 2018-02-03 18:34:26 They made room for who,I see the #2 pick, Olive Oil, the player that is using up all his sick leave benefits.Trades r to be evaluated in a couple of seasons not now. I propose another trade, Olive Oil (Mr.Softee)to any team that is 10-20pic,since they pick 48 in the second round.
2201 2018-02-03 18:34:04 How about sh!t we use everyday instead of putting money into oil companies pockets. Fix the bridges. Fix the electric grid. Fix the roads...
2202 2018-02-03 18:34:04 Bout to change my own damn oil for these prices 
2203 2018-02-03 18:33:58 Why do so many people not know how to put oil in their car 
2204 2018-02-03 18:33:39 Lots and lots of water. Rubbing a little bit of lavender oil in the temples helps a bit too.
2205 2018-02-03 18:33:34 Prolly easier than stealing oil or blowing up stuff!
2206 2018-02-03 18:33:21 remember when slick wolf stole oil can harry's NGAAAAAAHHHHHHH
2207 2018-02-03 18:33:19 Do you think we’ll stop drinking beer, eating sugar, drinking juice, using cooking oil any time soon? Or start eat ugly bumpy carrot or potatoes? Of course we would use the next best economic alternative & we do use some starch sources specifically for our cows & some byproducts
2208 2018-02-03 18:33:15 The oil fields in Nigeria are closer to Katsina than the oilfields of Niger Republic.
2209 2018-02-03 18:32:56 Ooooo beautiful thank you! What repair oil do you use?
2210 2018-02-03 18:32:51 John west tuna in sunflower oil, brine and spring water
2211 2018-02-03 18:32:46 So a leaking pipeline that benefits oil companies and rapes Native American lands is an infrastructure project? Asking for a friend
2212 2018-02-03 18:32:20 A massive oil tanker and….
2213 2018-02-03 18:32:18 I seriously hope they cut off the gas and oil to BC. Watch your economy tank hard. Your precious hemp-built iPad will have trohble@running on unicorn farts.
2214 2018-02-03 18:32:17 Power coffee. Cup of strong liquid (instant is ok), 15g butter + 15g coconut oil, blitz with stick blender or liquidiser...delicious. Yes, I didn't believe either until I tried it. Keeps hunger at bay for hours.
2215 2018-02-03 18:32:07 Maduro correctly observes that many others have succeeded at selling cryptocurrencies redeemable for nothing and having no intrinsic value. Why shouldn't he try the same thing? Oil "backing" is just rhetoric.
2216 2018-02-03 18:32:06 Oil spills and destruction to environment already happening while regulations for safety to the American people out the window. Helping himself and other criminals ruin this country while stuffing their greedy gut with more money.  SHAMELESS PEOPLE.
2217 2018-02-03 18:32:04 Washing face and exfoliating before bed, topping it off with a hydrating night repair oil every night. In the morning use toner to remove excess dirt from under your skin, moisturizer is a must, under eye cream to prevent early wrinkles and a face mask at least once a week!
2218 2018-02-03 18:32:04 Oil and gas, and it seems tobacco is in the mix too, weirdly enough.
2219 2018-02-03 18:32:02 'Green Energy' requires crude oil, most of the Green Energy is stepping back not forward.  America needs new innovation to move forward.  Unsubstantiated comments and closed minds kill innovation.

2224 2018-02-03 18:31:12 Funny your profile pic is a shot of the shore. You may want to add oil slicks or derricks in there, you corporate shill.
2225 2018-02-03 18:30:54 Deregulation and refusing to hold oil companies accountable for spills will make things exponentially worse
2226 2018-02-03 18:30:52 That was the project that really stuck lol!!  Before that she was carving gourds, making paper mache air ballons and painting little balls with oil paint that tool forever to dry

2231 2018-02-03 18:30:25 Tourism is huge in BC. Start the boycott there. Start canceling your ski trips and summer rentals and tell them why, let them know your taking your money, made off oil & gas, to somewhere that wants it.

2235 2018-02-03 18:30:05 How Many Oil Spills Have We Had With the Keystone pipeline Since Pres Trump Has Taken office!!Sad!!
2236 2018-02-03 18:30:01 And since the govt suck their nose in it oil lobbies have basically owned America. Caused wars, suppressed alternative energy, and so on.
2237 2018-02-03 18:29:57 Did you twist on dry or wet hair? To be me wet had better results.  I would also suggest sealing the moisture with an oil when you're twisting.

2240 2018-02-03 18:29:32 Oil, coal and steam was the building blocks for the great nations of the past. The future belongs to the nations that are able to reinvent those energies that supplant them.

Trump the President of the people.

2241 2018-02-03 18:29:24 True. Lie the usa seized upon the oil in Iraq. Wants to seize upon the oil in iran......
2242 2018-02-03 18:29:08 @ladygaga My wife has fibromyalgia and rheumatoid disease. After years of searching, I found that a sativa derived CBD oil, as the precussor symptoms in feet and forearms, significantly reduces the flare up. For what it’s worth. Great heartfelt empathy.

Stop doubting, just ask.
2244 2018-02-03 18:29:06 This mint leaf & olive oil body wash smell so good...
2245 2018-02-03 18:28:39 The robber barons is a myth. Rockefeller increased the supply and plummeted the price of oil and kerosene. He saved the whales in massively increased literacy by making lamp-light so cheap. By the time the govt intervened his competition had caught up and he only had 25% ofmarket
2246 2018-02-03 18:28:20 Just now I read that the CDC is forced to cut back their work by 80% due to a massive funding reduction. The EPA has been similarly gutted. The clean water regulations were suspended for two years. Drilling for oil was permitted virtually everywhere. You call this winning?!
2247 2018-02-03 18:28:19 But all the land in between is owned by British Columbia. If you want to fly the oil over then you don’t need to argue with us. You could just do it.
2248 2018-02-03 18:28:16 Man U needs a new coach sha. Mourinho oil no been plenty. He’s done!
2249 2018-02-03 18:28:12 If you think JRM and his ilk are moderate then there is no hope. He has all the aura of a snake oil salesman, and should not be trusted
2250 2018-02-03 18:28:10 The oils sands project has been going on for 50 years. Why did no one figure out or plan how to get the oil out of the province? Too much reliance on American oil men?
2251 2018-02-03 18:27:59 An oil tanker with 13,500 tons of fuel has disappeared off the coast of  Benin in West Africa. The vessel was registered in Panama, on board were  22 Indian crew.
2252 2018-02-03 18:27:57 Or like walking and chewing gum at the same time.  We need to realize, demand for oil is growing, if we shut ourselves out of the market we help other oil producers.

2258 2018-02-03 18:27:02 If they try to rewrite devolution then surely talks will start on the premise that scots oil and gas resources are scotlands
2259 2018-02-03 18:26:58 This is already being done by @TarsheedQatar campaign launched by @kahramaa, but it can also be done for other types of energy use (transport).

As for the largest footprint, this is because Qatar is a large exporter of energy (oil, gas, & derivatives) to other countries.
2260 2018-02-03 18:26:54 But, also treating them with aloe vera oil and tea tree oil. And gosh today my face just looks absolutely stunning. Sorry to toot my own horn but, i’m not sorry. #Buildingconfidence #lovingmyself
2261 2018-02-03 18:26:41 Russia has cheap oil
2262 2018-02-03 18:26:29 Sadly, the oil company is going to win the league.
2263 2018-02-03 18:26:26 You mean the ones that are already spilling oil? Great
2264 2018-02-03 18:26:10 It’s was the close oil shop from where I was at so I just said fuck it
2265 2018-02-03 18:26:10 oil sands like conventional oil can be expanded and Canada could become independent, what you now call 'climate crisis' is just another name for your faith in greatest con of all time.

2267 2018-02-03 18:26:01 A Portuguese friend told me that there (Portugal) they pick it fresh from the garden and eat it raw, like we would a carrot! I did an oven recipe: fennel, broth, olive oil, salt and pepper (covered), and then the latter half, parmigiano cheese (uncovered).
2268 2018-02-03 18:25:55 I heard these are good for your skin sweet almond oil & grapeseed oil. I would use it after I get through with cleansing myself with black soap. Good to put that oil back into your skin, black soap dries up skin extremely. Packing should be safe, secure & cute.
2269 2018-02-03 18:25:47 you can't help but think that if matters had progressed as they should have done from the beginning of the 20th century, Scotland would have been independent long before we discovered oil
it has been a long struggle, it was severely dented but the movement never really went away
2270 2018-02-03 18:25:45 And it's not pushing oil Shannon, it's choosing responsibly produced CAD oil vs. other nations that do it with no regard for the environment, human rights etc. If you want to change the GLOBAL climate expand outside the 1% in Canada.
2271 2018-02-03 18:25:45 Eugene Thacker uses the phrase "eschatology-of-oil" and I'm super into it
2272 2018-02-03 18:25:38 Keystone $ XL have no infrastructure value. Enriching Big Oil while providing short term jobs.
2273 2018-02-03 18:25:35 I Need To Go Get An Oil Change
2274 2018-02-03 18:25:33 It’s like turning an oil tanker. No quick fix. Create many chances and were goals sloppy?
2275 2018-02-03 18:25:32 We also need to be aware that there is a great deal of money at stake for everyone participating with Trump (Tillerson's Oil money is included).  We need to get money out of politics to prevent this from happening again.
2276 2018-02-03 18:25:28 For instance, I'd be happy to cut off government subsidies to oil, corn, sugar, coal, nuclear, etc. But I'd also cut off subsidies to insurance companies.
2277 2018-02-03 18:25:28 It wasn’t even fake pot. it was fake HEMP oil, which itself is non-psychoactive but has tremendous pharmacological benefits. That’s so crazy this policy is.
2278 2018-02-03 18:25:27 hi i put castor oil in my brows to grow them out and go get them done so yay
2279 2018-02-03 18:25:07 Section 87, 88, 89 of the Indian Act, and Section 35 and 24 of the Canadian constitution.

If Canadian law and the Constitution are allowed to be steamrolled by oil companies, what is the point of law and a judicial system in Canada?

2283 2018-02-03 18:24:45 Investments in oil pipelins are investments in the past. That´s all @POTUS can do. Bringing back the past instead of moving forward.
2284 2018-02-03 18:24:35 Canceling a nail appointment to get your oil changed instead is some adult ass shit.  I don’t like being an adult. Lol
2285 2018-02-03 18:24:35 The next memo...

Pick up dry cleaning
Get oil changed
2286 2018-02-03 18:24:33 Meanwhile the $1.50 a week for her is gone in just 4 gallons of gas due to recent oil stock increases. Predicted to rise more, at least .75 per gallon by late May.
2287 2018-02-03 18:24:30 Exactly - you have no business using a photo of a solar panel since @gop and @realDonaldTrump are rushing to destroy renewable energy businesses in favor of oil and nonexistent "clean coal." You should show robber barons, ceo's, members of congress - that's who is getting raises.
2288 2018-02-03 18:24:18 Lol that’s it kick me when I am down apologies.. he said with a glass in his hand .. now that’s evil ha ha ha x
2289 2018-02-03 18:23:40 Water and coconut oil 
2290 2018-02-03 18:23:33 Veteran words of wisdom... wash your hands in milk first...I suspect jalapeños are fat soluable so vegetable oil may work too
2291 2018-02-03 18:23:14 Bruh- don’t come into a store that specializes in one thing and demand a completely different product. I wouldn’t walk into your office job and demand an oil change, stop asking me for things I don’t provide. K thanks
2292 2018-02-03 18:23:12 Prolly not
2293 2018-02-03 18:23:09 @OhmRoad I tried some coconut oil today and it was yummy

2297 2018-02-03 18:22:57 Not interested in understanding you. You campaign and vote for Unionists. Thieves, Dissemblers. Liars. You are only interested in Scotlands Resources
Milliband said there'd be gun turrets and guards at English Border. Sounds ok. Will keep Unionists away from Scotland and Our Oil
2298 2018-02-03 18:22:56 Suffering is not always the same. Sometimes you suffer for digital art, and then for oil painting.
2299 2018-02-03 18:22:55 Mine went up 20 a week. Gas also went up so my money is going to big oil. Thanks!
2300 2018-02-03 18:22:42 Bro hit me with the link for the oil.

2318 2018-02-03 18:20:14 Your account seems a little "one note". All you post on is pushing oil.
2319 2018-02-03 18:20:04 You know and God knows.....it's all about money and oil!!! Not fooling anybody!

2323 2018-02-03 18:19:35 How interesting, is this for those with block glands? (Or can those with little and poor quality oil benefit?)
2324 2018-02-03 18:19:32 It’s an electric ferry being charged by the copious amounts of oil they produce

2331 2018-02-03 18:18:37 the only reason people make butter/coco oil is for brownies and stuff that needs a fat

2336 2018-02-03 18:18:01 Praying for your speedy recovery & hoping you are supplementing with things like echinacea tea, oil of oregano, and maybe some eucalyptus essential oil in a diffuser 
2337 2018-02-03 18:17:57 Hvala, Čričo. Ker za ''hemp oil'' prvič slišim, moram bolj podrobno prebrati. (Ni ravno poceni).  Ima kdo izkušnje s tem?

2342 2018-02-03 18:17:17 it's not that Congress WH etc are now aware of #globalwarming . Problem is they don't want to do anything about it because Oil&Gas is paying them. #corrupt

I WENT TO WHERE THEY MAKE THAT OIL
LET'S GO TOGETHER ON SUMMER
2358 2018-02-03 18:16:03 Been told about a program that was on in the 80s about boys working on oil rigs in the north east. No idea what it’s called but does anyone have a clue?
2359 2018-02-03 18:15:58 REFERENDUM for Biafra Jews and Christians, Homeland of over 70% of African Americans. Suffered from SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE for British oil.

2362 2018-02-03 18:15:44 this tea tree oil is a lie
2363 2018-02-03 18:15:22 Like you have someone with a newer than 2013 German whip and even if they figure out how to change just the oil, there’s tons of different recommended shit for each maintenance
2364 2018-02-03 18:15:21 WOW!  This video on Trump lying is FULL of lies!!  There was a war on American energy: Obama regulated coal mines to death - literallly.  He even said his goal was to destroy coal.  He wouldn't allow oil drilling on Fed lands. which meant we produced less energy.
2365 2018-02-03 18:15:14 I need an oil change
2366 2018-02-03 18:15:04 To think I typed 'groundnut oil' and cleared it before posting! 
2367 2018-02-03 18:15:02 Lather up with baby oil
2368 2018-02-03 18:14:52 Likely we would be farther along with development of water-based plastics, similar to spider silk. It’s perfectly possible, but we don’t because oil is so much easier to work with while we have it. I don’t see the issue with protesting the oil sands.
2369 2018-02-03 18:14:48 Consider switching to darker containers to preserve the oil
2370 2018-02-03 18:14:48 Trudeau's claim we can expand oil sands and fight climate crisis at the same time an update on "we can suck and blow at the same time." #GPC

The $1 that leaves is never taxed again in U.S.

2385 2018-02-03 18:12:24 Boiler man says heating system is old and wasnt surprised how fast oil is used. Radiators are really big. We knows now so wont let it happen again 
2386 2018-02-03 18:12:20 Here's what I don't get and I may of missed it but where is the argument that both coasts should want to ensure that a supply of oil is always available. We could get in a tiff with a foreign supplier and poof crippling gas shortages.
2387 2018-02-03 18:12:17 Oil change or tune ups for now
2388 2018-02-03 18:12:15 Thank you for tweeting these wins. Gives me hope.

2390 2018-02-03 18:11:51 The oil is the only reason Nigeria exists as it is today
2391 2018-02-03 18:11:50 This idea that the long term outlook for crude oil price will remain high should be revisited again. Government needs to start thinking about deepening our Capital Market via privatization of national assets as this will further help attract international portfolio managers.
2392 2018-02-03 18:11:50 Currently at Firestone getting an oil change & I always hate how long these things take

2399 2018-02-03 18:11:02 This <huge $1.50 windfall> is temporary when cuts for individuals expire in a few years.  

Corporate tax rates, inheritance, credits for private schools, and maintenance of private airplanes are permanent, as are cuts for oil/gas to benefit a few Republican in House/Senate.
2400 2018-02-03 18:11:02 Naw son. Our problem is Unionist parties like yours. You stay in England with yer Unionist Corbynistas. Don't rely on us to save yer arse. Not happening. 
We're off. And we're taking Our Oil! 
Am sure City of London will share with the rest of you. 

2401 2018-02-03 18:10:56 Buddy it's not about "we" getting rich.  It's about Canada making money.  Alberta has the safest way to produce oil, also pipelines is the safest way transport it. Also I severely doubt the world will be done with hydrocarbons in a couple of decades.  That is a pipe dream.
2402 2018-02-03 18:10:55 Like Cetaphil or stg and you can use coconut oil or probably like cold cream to help removal.
2403 2018-02-03 18:10:43 West Texas you should the towns over here are growing booming cuz of the oil! Its dope can do shit out here I can't out there nshit hahah

2407 2018-02-03 18:10:10 I waxed my upper lip this morning.
When I went to clean the area up with dry face oil, I only had cotton balls.
The thick cotton fibres stuck to my face where there was leftover wax.
So I traded in my barely there peach fuzz for a thick, white moustache.
Sup?
2408 2018-02-03 18:10:07 @GracoInc where I can apply then oil for my sprayer 390
2409 2018-02-03 18:10:01 Listen this is a country of 10 Provinces and 2 territories. All for one and one for all, we stick together through thick and thin no matter what we do. Lets get this done for Alberta to sell oil.
2410 2018-02-03 18:09:51 Bit of tempura batter and few seconds in hot oil... yes 
2411 2018-02-03 18:09:49 Getting my oil change and the works. Zack is keeping me company, thank Jesus the fam works here  @SamPacksFord
2412 2018-02-03 18:09:48 Now I'm craving yam and oil!

2413 2018-02-03 18:09:45 Getting my oil changed and the TV just had a commercial of a nurse yelling names. 
She goes “Ms. Sanchez? Ms. Sanchez?”
I deadass just looked up at the TV thinking someone was talking to me. 
2414 2018-02-03 18:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
2415 2018-02-03 18:09:35 I love vitamin e oil for that and a little fresh lemon juice lightens up certain dark spots
2416 2018-02-03 18:09:23 @RachelNotley  Alberta, and Canada needs to get off it's addiction to oil.  The risk to the coast, from increased numbers of tankers of dilbit, is not worth the money, nor is the carbon foot print in this age of anthropic climate change.
2417 2018-02-03 18:09:21 Mix coconut oil and baking soda together, apply the mix to your black heads, and POOF black heads gone!!

2425 2018-02-03 18:08:45 I find so much enjoyment watching Newcomb Oil (FiveStar) raise their gas prices 20¢ higher than anyone else, only to drop back down the next day. (Thanks Kroger).
2426 2018-02-03 18:08:38 It was a Sister! I got to use Nuln Oil instead, so it's not really cheating. :D
2427 2018-02-03 18:08:32 This vitamin e oil got my hair smelling magical
2428 2018-02-03 18:08:32 Favorites ever: avocado kernel in  season, apricot kernel in . Right now I'm using up the last bit of my sweet almond oil (nice, but mostly I bought it b/c it came in a pump bottle)
2429 2018-02-03 18:08:31 My face is in bad shape as she gave me some bath oil, but told me it was for my face. I have spoken to and seen three Doctors who all say the burns are not there but any passer by can tell you where my skin is white and perfect and where it is red and burned.
2430 2018-02-03 18:08:26 
2431 2018-02-03 18:08:25 Disappointed to hear none of the Ben & Jerry’s “truffles” flavors use truffle oil/butter or the fruiting body of an underground mushroom.
2432 2018-02-03 18:08:11 oh of course I didnt know u were still making stuff u never got back to me I just ordered the hair oil!!
2433 2018-02-03 18:08:04 Retail is a suck job and I sympathize. I have worked retail too. But it isn't a directly evil thing to do on the level of working for a bank or oil company. We each make our choices and sacrifices. I sacrifice financial security to grow my soul. No regrets here.

When crude oil prices are so low/Barrel, why r we still playing such high prices for Petrol/Diesel/Gas ?!
2437 2018-02-03 18:07:42 i also drank some olive oil wth my breath stinks and i'm drunk

2448 2018-02-03 18:06:24 BC has wanted a cut of the oil profits that will flow through their province for a long time.
Alberta doesn't want to share
2449 2018-02-03 18:06:22 And price of petrol  is dictated to by global oil prices at most. And as a driver, even when Zuma completes his term of office, the prices of car parts are not likely to go down.
2450 2018-02-03 18:06:15 Since the Treaty of Union

Scotland has never, NEVER, been subsidised by England!
English Treasury Records prove that.

In fact, Scotland has ~ 75% of her wealth always retained for subsidising England - without factoring in the oil 

Want to argue, then let’s open the books!
2451 2018-02-03 18:06:09 My wife homeschooled our children. They did real well for getting their GED's.

2453 2018-02-03 18:06:01 Does anyone like going to get their car serviced??? Maybe I should create a business that will come pick up your car for an oil change and return it.

2463 2018-02-03 18:05:02 ugh. I know the feeling. My daily regimen of magnesium citrate, evening primrose oil and st. john's wort have helped a good bit though. If you haven't tried those out yet, they may help.
2464 2018-02-03 18:04:58 In the great words of @MichaelRapaport he’s gonna get the wonder bag olive oil treatment.
2465 2018-02-03 18:04:54 I came to Midas for a $20 oil change. After an hour, I’m up to over $100. 
2466 2018-02-03 18:04:41 We're here at the dealership for an oil change & tire rotation and they're offering to trade up my son's car(2016 Focus) for the 2017 Fusion. Will be just under a 100 more in payments. My son doesn't want to do it.

2468 2018-02-03 18:04:24 Now, personally, I'm not sure how olive oil would last a couple of years since I use so much of it, but it's really about the storage.
2469 2018-02-03 18:04:23  Feel better soon! Take a eucalyptus oil bath.

2538 2018-02-03 17:55:29 Green Revolution was a brilliant Rockefeller family scheme to develop a globalized agribusiness which they monopolized just as the world oil industry before. 
Henry Kissinger 1970’s,‘If you control the oil you control the country; if you control food, you control the population.’
2539 2018-02-03 17:55:09 If she uses more than 4 gallons of gas per week, she's already lost that $1.50 due to the rise in prices while tax giveaways enrich oil companies even more.

2544 2018-02-03 17:54:33 i have been putting off an oil change and removal of a screw from my tire for months-perhaps next week. 
2545 2018-02-03 17:54:21 Electricity also started in Africa. It's a fact some pyramids were power stations, they had metal rod conductors at the top of the pin and channels on the inside for oil. We have done everything before these bozos.
2546 2018-02-03 17:54:20 Wondering if the quality of the fish oil matters?  I wish they would use a virgin cold pressed salmon oil with minimal processing like “wholemega” by new chapter. Most fish and krill oil is highly processed  #astaxanthin @DrKristieLeong
2547 2018-02-03 17:54:20 Have cbd oil at a discount  750 mg and also 500 mg thc free and 100% cbd no fillers
2548 2018-02-03 17:54:16 Nigeria is actually mad.

Would Putin build a refinery on the Russian-Finnish border to refine Finnish crude, given that Russia is Europe's largest exporter of crude oil and gas (by far)?
2549 2018-02-03 17:54:08 Trump is Putin’s puppet? More oil exploration and production, lowering prices and hurting Russia’s largest export and their economy, strong US economy, Strong US military, think those are high on Vlad’s list of wants?  Retaliation for Syrian chemical attack  haha @DNC is done

2553 2018-02-03 17:53:51 Nah. It started in the mid-late 1970s. Neoliberalism used the Oil Crisis (oligopolies manipulating price on a core world economy input) to wedge out Keynesianism, which had been working pretty well til then.

It's been downhill since then. Result: zero to tiny growth worldwide.
2554 2018-02-03 17:53:49 Reading profit over people by Noam Chomsky and it is very enlightening on how the rich continue to subvert progress for everyone else for their own profits. Remember that when you buy gas it's cheap simply because america dumps millions into war and control of oil countries.
2555 2018-02-03 17:53:40 @NalleyKia came in for an oil change and a tire rotation, and they forgot to do the tire rotation. How is that possible? Now I’m still waiting for them to pull it back in for the tire rotation. Two plus hours and counting.
2556 2018-02-03 17:53:36 Yes, unfortunately the pound has recovered against the dollar to pre-referendum levels.
Note to @PeterTu51472302
The dollar is the world reserve currency & commodities, oil, wheat etc are priced in dollars, so pound versus the dollar is ratio to watch for economic performance.
2557 2018-02-03 17:53:14 Get some vitamin e oil and put it on your lips. It helps sooo much.

2559 2018-02-03 17:52:56 What about the big oil and chemical companies who are profiting greatly from the tax bill; are they handing out big bonuses?  Waiting to hear about them doing so....

2561 2018-02-03 17:52:40 2 of 2 That was at 10am. Me humans are still cleaning. Clothes ruined, rugs ruined, no heating or hot water til maybe Tues... or Wed. We has the woodburner so we iz all thankful for that, but this could've all been avoided if they'd just checked the oil! #ZSHQ #BTposse
2562 2018-02-03 17:52:31 Yes! When so many of the things trump is doing Any Repub would be doing if given the chance (massive deregulation, tax cuts to rich, criminalizing immigrants, allow oil drilling in pristine arctic, deconstruct Edu, EPA etc etc
2563 2018-02-03 17:52:25 @GracoInc I have a sprayer 390 where I have to apply the oil to the pump??
2564 2018-02-03 17:52:09 Frightening when the oil company is more believable.
2565 2018-02-03 17:52:05 @RachelNotley You may want to point out to those in BC that if we don't get oil from fellow Canadians, we buy from the States OR from countries that support terrorists. Without oil, we have no cellphones, boats, or appliances like we know them.

2570 2018-02-03 17:51:41 As in.  His input made a great difference o. I went for an interview in PH in an oil servicing firm. Na that my old CV fall my hand. The head of the panel no gree me talk.  

I cried from ph to owerri.

2573 2018-02-03 17:51:28 What I see is that he clearly broke a clear promise to make #UNDRIP actionable pleadable law. Then twiddled while Supreme Court took a clearly UNDRIP-contradicting position.  

He makes critical infrastructure promises conditional on dirty oil export.

Rigs his “electoral reform”
2574 2018-02-03 17:51:25 Here's something for you. The stock market is for rich folk. That's why when oil/gas prices fall (which helps the average citizen) the whole market falls. It's all about stock prices and dividends. Cutting jobs = Higher dividends/stock price.
2575 2018-02-03 17:51:25 Trump and reading in the same sentence is like oil and water in the same cup.

2580 2018-02-03 17:51:01 The American Heart Association is the most incompetent organization so I wouldn’t trust their findings. My mom’s cholesterol reduced when she started taking coconut oil.
2581 2018-02-03 17:51:01 How can this be? Don’t “We the People” have any say about our national monuments being pillaged by Trump and his oil industry pals? Our country is being turned into a wasteland for MONEY!
2582 2018-02-03 17:50:52 I am telling you;

2584 2018-02-03 17:50:31 What is the probability that 
1. Low oil prices
2. Good monsoons
3. Majority in LS for the ruling party

all happen at once?. IMO, this is once in a generation chance where fate shows you all the right cards. But our own moves have checkmated us.
2585 2018-02-03 17:50:29 @BlackOrchid_BBO has the best body oil.
2586 2018-02-03 17:50:25 @augustineyerra Not passing on oil price reduction to people was the biggest blunder politically & economically
2587 2018-02-03 17:50:17 A merchant vessel Marine Express (oil tanker), owned by Mumbai-based Anglo Eastern shipping company with 22 Indian nationals onboard, is presumably missing off the coast of Benin in the Gulf of Guinea.
2588 2018-02-03 17:50:17 I was actually referring to utility scale #renewables. For example, wind and #solar would do very well in Alberta, and once the turbines and panels are installed, the cost of fuel drops to $0. THAT’S the real reason why big oil hates renewables.
2589 2018-02-03 17:49:58 You need to ask your grandma to tell you how the “jradin” steal chicken eggs, or actually consume stocked olive oil. You’d be literally surprised

2663 2018-02-03 17:49:17 She like Justin is just trying to sell a Canadian asset to grow our economy. Not every province is supported by tourism. If you have an idea of how we could replace the revenue created from selling oil I would love to hear it. Maybe we should just sell BC pot internationally!!
2664 2018-02-03 17:49:16 Why not just use walnut or grape oil or sunflower ?

2676 2018-02-03 17:48:23 Yeah, nice swamp draining - Mnuchin is a big banker looking out for corporate interest. Tillerson IS big oil. DeVos owns or is part of big private education firms. 

They're just funneling money to their boards and you support it.

2680 2018-02-03 17:48:13 I love Argan oil
2681 2018-02-03 17:48:12 Dank. En bekend natuurlijk. Interessant om de discussie te zien schuiven van peak oil productie naar peak oil demand en de consequentie daarvan op de markt en prijzen.
2682 2018-02-03 17:48:07 1 of 2 Another disaster in French France today, Pals  me humans forgot to check the oil level for the heatin which buggered the boiler. Man came to fix it &all the soot in the boiler ended up in the rest of the house AND all over humum! #ZSHQ #BTposse
2683 2018-02-03 17:47:56 And the fact is that offshore wind is both the cheapest form of energy now and, unlike hinckley c, a proven technology that leverages former North Sea oil industry skills. Win win.
2684 2018-02-03 17:47:40 It's not our oil.  And different grades of oil get different prices. 
Capitalism.
2685 2018-02-03 17:47:38 Given current market shares of rare earth metals (China #1 by a lot I believe) & substantial environmental concerns about expanding rare earth production, seems like west is trading dependence on ME oil for dependence on Chinese rare earths; not sure that's a smart strategic move

2687 2018-02-03 17:47:03 An oil conglomerate in Irving, TX, said it was pleasantly surprised when its pay went up $1.50 per 7.8 nanoseconds ... it said [that] will more than cover its executive bonuses for the year.

2689 2018-02-03 17:46:41 Yes and people need to start understanding, that most world leaders are pawns to big oil. It is big oil that moves and makes demands on the troops. All the President does is just salute them and say, "very well then".

2691 2018-02-03 17:46:20 Even with oil revenue sharing, states are not viable, without it the truth will be obvious let us stop lying to ourselves
2692 2018-02-03 17:45:58 If you aren’t spending your day getting an oil change, tires rotated, a screw taken out of your tire, and going to a kids birthday party for two hours, then are you really an adult bruh?
2693 2018-02-03 17:45:53 I love the smell of coconut oil bc it reminds me of one of my favourite people
2694 2018-02-03 17:45:49 just to let you know McDonald's can't guarantee the fillet o fish is cooked to halal standards.  something to do with the filtration of the oil.
2695 2018-02-03 17:45:48 When it's too cold to do an oil change at home on your own, so you go to a shop and they are so busy it takes an hour and a half.
2696 2018-02-03 17:45:43 Getting an oil change again, they smell the fear on me, they know I'm pampered.
2697 2018-02-03 17:45:41 What thing ? Putin DESPERATELY NEEDS Hitlery as American president. Weak, energy-starving, impotent America- is his DREAM. His ALL revenue is mostly oil, gas, coal, wood. He needs uranium too. Familiar ?
Trump's America ? He's worst nightmare.
2698 2018-02-03 17:45:34 I don't use body oil.
2699 2018-02-03 17:45:18 someone please tell me if rosehip oil is really worth it or not I need ANSWERS

2701 2018-02-03 17:45:03 The anxiety I have when just going to get an oil change is ridiculous 
2702 2018-02-03 17:44:59 Lana: "He's attacked nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, and whaling ships."

Archer: "Whaling ships? What he's got something against clean burning lamp oil?"
2703 2018-02-03 17:44:42 No my car just take synthetic oil.
2704 2018-02-03 17:44:32 So good, it's a pepperoni and sausage pizza with another crust on top. Then they put olive oil and provolone on the upper crust
2705 2018-02-03 17:44:10 More correctly, Alberta Oil destined for Asia so investors can make money while we take all the risk. Sweet deal. Alberta should make what Canada needs and we stop importing and exporting while we transition off hydrocarbons over next few decades. You+I dont get rich either way.
2706 2018-02-03 17:44:10 That oil libya petrol station on limuru road is where the rich kids come with their expensive toys on saturday nights.. You cant miss sth to shake your mind on..

2709 2018-02-03 17:43:47 If she uses more than 4 gallons of gas per week, she's in the red now thanks to the tireless work of the GOP to raise oil stock prices.
2710 2018-02-03 17:43:40 Plus your boss at the time was alleged to have owed Qaddafi a load of cash and was annoyed that Italy had most of the oil concessions.

2713 2018-02-03 17:43:21 I hate them  who would cook their fries in peanut oil!!!
2714 2018-02-03 17:43:15 Packaging is so key. It needs to release the product s l o w l y. I like to pour a bit in my hands & apply to damp skin. I love @LeonorGreylUSA Magnolia Oil with the pump, @NUXE Huile Prodgieuse with the spray. Even Bio Oil with the tiny hole for dropping.
2715 2018-02-03 17:43:14 Honestly, I use Neutrogena. The light sesame formula. I like that it’s lightweight and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy. But in terms of packaging, I wish that it came with a pump! I’d avoid glass, though, because oil and glass in the shower...doesn’t mix.

2719 2018-02-03 17:43:04 Will you please help get the oil companies to get prices back to $40 a barrel.  I feel like the hike in gas prices have essentially whipped out my tax break!  I thought production was at an all time high!  Please make America great again for me and my family.
2720 2018-02-03 17:43:00 But they align with the Europeans who were deathly afraid of losing Libyan oil access...and who figured they were entitled to their own military adventures after the US got to destroy Iraq and take over Afghanistan.
2721 2018-02-03 17:42:54 James Bond warned us of this!! Will lead to WWIII and not oil.
2722 2018-02-03 17:42:52 If you think about it, vaping oil technically saved my life. It gave me strep throat and led me to discovering the lump in my neck that was removed within a month’s time. Moral of the story: vApE iS LiFe bRuHhHh

2725 2018-02-03 17:42:38 Waited 2 1/2 hours for an oil change cuz they were waiting for a filter. Finally gets here and takes them 15 mins to change. I called days ahead to avoid this happening AGAIN and it keeps. Happening. To me.
2726 2018-02-03 17:42:30 im just quitting all drugs this will be my final oil thing. Ill still be grinding like im @1future tho
2727 2018-02-03 17:42:29 Finally got an oil change. I’ve been meaning to get one since Christmas 
2728 2018-02-03 17:42:23 seems like a dealer gig. putting low amounts of oil to create a revolving door =3
2729 2018-02-03 17:42:17 Why can't Oregon stockpile pot for the upcoming apocalypse. Texas stockpiles oil.
2730 2018-02-03 17:42:04 Trump has to hurry and steal all the oil & minerals he can before he is throw out of office! Vote for our lives!!!

2731 2018-02-03 17:41:58 I like to roast butternut squash after cubing it, tossing it in olive oil, sage, salt and pepper and adding fresh cranberries and pecans to the pan.
2732 2018-02-03 17:41:46 Picking up my car from an oil change and the mechanic says, “Thank you sir, enjoy the game”. Honestly, I was confused because he didn’t look like a guy that was talking about @Everton vs @Arsenal As I returned to my car i realized he was talking about another game  #SoccerOnly
2733 2018-02-03 17:41:36 Dogwood is upset because by building the pipeline the DW will be loosing some American Funding to keep our Oil Land lock without access to the Asian market.The US Buy our oil for $31.00bbl and sell it to the Asian Market @ $60.23.Why DW gets paid to stop the pipeline by Big oil.
2734 2018-02-03 17:41:32 すばらしいデザインだった
2735 2018-02-03 17:41:27 Agreed but Canada’s political proponents of oil/gas as our major economic driver keeping us from major sustainable progress.
2736 2018-02-03 17:41:26 I’m trying to find on the internet, all the times provinces said NO to oil transfer payments. The Hypocrisy is staggering. BC your going to look like a pouty child when this is all over.

2747 2018-02-03 17:40:14 Brushing up on energy transfers by transferring some neatly cut potatoes into hot oil and then devouring them all.
2748 2018-02-03 17:40:14 Let's talk body oil! What are your faves? How are you using it?  What's important to you in terms of packaging? I'm trying to see something...
2749 2018-02-03 17:40:08 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
2750 2018-02-03 17:40:04 Only thing I can think of, is that the farm I purchased her from may have fed molasses.  It looks similar to oil.  Oh well.  It should clean up any parasites.
2751 2018-02-03 17:39:53 gold and oil dont usually fall during stock corrections idiot.
we are back in a bush economy headed back to the 2007 recession. only problem is there will be no bail-out, because of republicans tax scam, and china and russia will overtake us as economic powerhouses.
2752 2018-02-03 17:39:37 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!

The Olive Oil pronunciation is so funny~~ Jesse is great
2757 2018-02-03 17:39:24 You cannot reason with these people. They just want the Oil Sands shut down at the detriment of Canada and Canadians.Also, a lot of these so called Protesters are PAID to protest.This is what they do for a living!They may not even care about the topic but will cry wolf for money!
2758 2018-02-03 17:39:20 Thank you 
2759 2018-02-03 17:39:15 As my Aunt used to say in the 70's.  Send them all back and let them kill each other. (Both) Party line is oil/gas titans of industry come first.  My ? is when did citizens become casualties of business?  When did business take on the war model?
2760 2018-02-03 17:39:09 At a oil company office y'day, I was told of 2 evacuation plans: fire & earthquakes, which included a helmet & backpack with food & water.

2763 2018-02-03 17:38:49 Thank you 
2764 2018-02-03 17:38:34 Short term political gains always outweigh long-term economic benefits & it will be politically too expensive to construct a policy that cannot offer immediate results.

Low oil prices & gud monsoons offered this govt a chance to bring in major changes but the oprtunity was lost.
2765 2018-02-03 17:38:29 I have a rule of thumb: If Maina Kageni is selling something, treat it as 'snake oil'.
2766 2018-02-03 17:37:57 Here’s my contention..  there is nothing that is currently capable of replacing coal and oil to power the United States. A lot of $ and development needs to take place before #cleanenergy can sustain America. I hope our govt pursues clean energy but we need coal and oil for now
2767 2018-02-03 17:37:55 That’s a new one on me, what mineral was she craving that oil tasted good

2773 2018-02-03 17:37:25 "Norwegian government spends no more (and usually less) than 4% of its #oil profits on current expenses. The other 96% goes into that trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund." #Norway #economy #labor
2774 2018-02-03 17:37:17 Thank you Elizabeth, and thank you Martyn for the brilliant piece. People are beginning to wake up to the threat that expansion of oil and gas poses. Trampling the rights of indigenous people puts the govt's integrity into question in the worst way.
2775 2018-02-03 17:37:05 None of what you noted had anything to do with the current IOCO oil route, NONE! I witnessed a pleasure craft dump 300 gallons of diesel & black H20 into the chuck off sand heads. Outrageous but again nothing to do with KM

2786 2018-02-03 17:36:29 Is this oil we are importing or exporting out of Canada?
2787 2018-02-03 17:36:16 This would explain why my PC is handling that peanut oil so poorly.

2815 2018-02-03 17:32:06 Agree the pitch is no excuse but it didnt help any, those surfaces are like oil slicks when wet, doesnt help we played total shite from start to finish, players know teams use these surfaces so should be getting used to them.
2816 2018-02-03 17:31:56 De techneut van Standard Oil zal het hele spel wel door een techneutenbril hebben bekeken. Wat u schrijft, bevestigt mijn stelling dat Nederland na WOII door de VS is bezet.

2822 2018-02-03 17:31:31 I made a appointment for a oil change. 30 min later still have not been waited on! Argh! A waisted day!
2823 2018-02-03 17:31:24 Unusually complex hair-washing: First an oil change, so I can cut it, then another wash to settle.
2824 2018-02-03 17:31:23 If I bring my car over will you change the oil?  I’ll help Sweetie around the house or something.
2825 2018-02-03 17:31:20 Our Rain-forests are being burned to produce Palm Oil.  Beautiful animals live there, some are close to Extinction.  GREED is destroying Earth, do you want to leave our Planet Desolate for our children?  It's already happening, do research.  #BOYCOTTPALMOILPRODUCTS
2826 2018-02-03 17:31:19 Ink types, yes. Most standard pens have a roller ball tip but mostly that phrase is used to describe and ink type. Rollerball ink is water based, ballpoint ink is oil based.

2843 2018-02-03 17:29:21 I've never seen such infuriating condescension. Screw you, Paul Ryan. When oil companies are saving millions per quarter and you expect us to be awestruck over a buck fifty a week for an average American, you have truly lost your way AND your mind.

2859 2018-02-03 17:26:55 Funny how an NEP designed to supply Canada with Canadian oil brought on a claim to "Alberta's oil" but now "BC's coast is Canada's coast". Meanwhile, AB has single-handedly rejected nationalizing OUR oil in favour of allowing foreign nationals to extract and ship the raw resource
2860 2018-02-03 17:26:54 My dogs are so high maintenance first of all they have cottage cheese mixed into their food for every meal and also fish oil supplements. They both take anxiety medicine and my one dog is scared of slippery surfaces so we have rugs everywhere so he can walk on the floor

2862 2018-02-03 17:26:40 The NDP were very clear in their campaign, protection of the environment was a major issue and would include consultations with the oil industry. It was only after the election and following those consultations that the carbon tax was decided upon.
2863 2018-02-03 17:26:01 ok so apparently oil paint takes like anywhere from like 6-24 hours to dry which I don’t know why I didn’t think about that because obviously it’s gonna take forever cause it’s fucking oil I should’ve got acrylic what a learning curve omg
2864 2018-02-03 17:26:01 I almost purchased an Austin Allegro at an auction once, i accidentally scratched my nose and bid on it for £20, in the end it sold for £50.  It left a trail of oil behind it when it was pushed away, probably so they new owner could find it later.

2866 2018-02-03 17:25:51 I took care of my father for 12 years, he had dementia. I highly recommend people start taking coconut oil. Research it, it's converted to ketones by the body and fuels the brain. It made my dad significantly better for 2 years, but it's not a cure. Just improves quality of life.
2867 2018-02-03 17:25:50 I looked it up and it’s apparently because there’s less hair for the oil to travel to

2876 2018-02-03 17:25:05 Vitamin A can help to regulate the amount of oil the body produces. The oil in your skin is designed to flow out onto the surface of the skin to protect and moisturise it.

2883 2018-02-03 17:24:19 Totally sarcastic. As if climate change activists had huge amounts of money to bribe scientists and the oil lobby is starving. I find it hilarious that s.o. could think that.

2892 2018-02-03 17:22:46 Yeah so we need to cut oil subsidies. They are profitable companies that can pay their own way.

2906 2018-02-03 17:21:05 It says light colour, paint oil... the long description below is about the texture/smell/quality of the paint
2907 2018-02-03 17:21:02 My nearest Costco is 2.5 hours away (without traffic), that's each way. I think the gas (especially the rising oil prices) will more than defeat that. Not to mention the wear and tear on my 13-year-old car. 
But sure, once I'm there I can buy the industrial size canned beans.
2908 2018-02-03 17:20:59 Alamak yeke. Bio oil? Hiruscar? Organic aid? Kalau semua tak okay kena jumpa doc lah nampak gayanya

Along with local officials, business owners & fishing captains, we made the case to protect NC from offshore oil & gas drilling. If he won’t, the Gov & I will go to court.

2917 2018-02-03 17:20:35 The rebellion uses oil and the empire uses solar energy... so you tell me who was evil
2918 2018-02-03 17:20:29 You do not seem very objective in your reporting.  Trump and his oil buddies are colluding with Russia, because it is also a big oil spigot. Makes perfect sense.  @Greg_Palast has done research that the @GOP has cheated in elections for years. Clinton news is not important now.

2927 2018-02-03 17:19:49 Really? I've never tried anything like that (I'm assuming it's an essential oil thing?).
2928 2018-02-03 17:19:42 I was supposed to go see my boyfriend last night for the first time in almost a month but I’m a fucking idiot and let my truck run almost completely out of oil, so it won’t start now and I have to get it towed to a mechanic!

2970 2018-02-03 17:13:36 Smashed it really bad with a ratchet trying to remove a oil plug from an engine to change oil. I'm pretty sure it's not broken as I can squeeze it and not hurt too bad. Just a lot of pressure from the bruising.

2979 2018-02-03 17:11:43 I had a similar dream the night before Osama Bin Laden was killed. A river ran with oil, and out of it emerged all wildlife. On the banks of the river, one giant alligator swallowed a more giant alligator. Until we conquer our reptilian minds and evolve, the path is destruction.
2980 2018-02-03 17:11:42 God will deliver Sierra Leone soon from draconian conditionalities  when we start drilling oil.

2983 2018-02-03 17:11:34 my coworkers gave me beard oil holy fuck.
2984 2018-02-03 17:11:30 But if you've just opened a bunch of acreage for mining, you want someone to tell the public it isn't exclusively for oil it's for "useful" minerals for the troops

You can massage 15ml or so into your hair & scalp, leave it on a few hours and then wash it out. It makes your hair super soft & shiny!

3005 2018-02-03 17:09:49 Regarding Russian sanctions  - how does tRump justify Russia selling oil to and buying coal from North Korea despite embargoes against these actions? The sanctions were voted in to punish Russia for election interference, but Russian  actions only validate the sanctions.

3012 2018-02-03 17:09:08 For the first time since 1970, U.S. crude oil production broke 10 million barrels a day. America’s “status is growing” as the world’s third largest oil producer, with production expected to expand. “Trump has embraced energy as an economic force and the U.S. will be dominant."

3057 2018-02-03 17:04:28 But it is folly to argue that "we don't need pipelines" - we do, and I'd much rather see pipelines moving oil than rail - we don't need another Lac Mégantic.

3061 2018-02-03 17:04:03 Which is weird because when oil was in short supply in the states they encouraged Canada sending oil from the "tar sands" and even retrofitted their biggest refineries to take Canadian crude.
3062 2018-02-03 17:04:02 Perish your prejudice.
You're not informed.
The Nigeria-Niger border refinery, if it ever materialises, will be fed by the crude oil from Niger NOT Niger Delta.
It's part of President Buhari's measures to ensure energy security for Northern Nigeria.
Call it what you want.
OK?
3063 2018-02-03 17:03:59 The primary contributor to CO2 emissions are the fossil fuels, coal, oil. Emissions from these fossil fuels have grown significantly in recent decades and driving a large part of the climate change we see. #PollutionFreePlanet #Youth2030 #MangrovesMatter

3083 2018-02-03 17:01:29 That’s nice. Maybe you could invest that money to research how to avoid oil spills, how to risk manage? Or hey! Maybe as a humongous billion dollar corporation, you could help other companies that are struggling right now?  Wow.

3085 2018-02-03 17:00:55 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
3086 2018-02-03 17:00:53 He has already made it more expensive by adding tariff's to solar panels.  Trump is determined to turn the heat up on the Democrats.  A President who has pushed big oil will not support solar.  He wants oil as expensive as possible.  It's to keep the dollar down for trade.

3097 2018-02-03 17:00:03 Yeah ... no - the blunt fact is that we still use oil in our society. We may be in transition away from it as primary energy, but that transition is a decades-long process. /1

3111 2018-02-03 16:57:17 @TerrySheehanMP  why are u killing Canadas oil i want an answer
3112 2018-02-03 16:57:11 Lying. 
Huuuuuge staff loss.
 I have big words.
I'm a stable genius.

This man is a Snake Oil Salesman.

Did I mention race? How about Puerto Rico? I think he has Mexicans confused w/Puerto Ricans.
3113 2018-02-03 16:57:01 With proper management, oil and gas that touched most of remote areas can boost economic growth. Digitalization, when it is well-distributed, can also spur economic growth.
3114 2018-02-03 16:57:00 Point is.  Oil is no longer the driving force of the Canadian economy as was stated.  This is probably a good thing and an opportunity for Alberta to diversify its economic DNA.
3115 2018-02-03 16:57:00 So I am definitely going to give her an oatmeal bath& use her doggo conditioner while we’re in there, and then I’ll mix some coconut oil into her duck breakfast.
3116 2018-02-03 16:56:44 Not pathetic at all. Oil heat is very expensive. My parents couldn't afford it either when I was growing up. Had many cold winters. Still wouldn't change any of it. Bundle up. Layers layers layers. 
3117 2018-02-03 16:56:32 When you say up front 'I have road hazard on all my tires', but they act surprised when, as they hand you the bill charging you for oil change AND tire repair, you say 'Why am I paying for repair when I have road hazard?' Lawd.

3125 2018-02-03 16:55:32 Happy birthday to God's general, Pst. Sam Adeyemi. May God's grace on your life increase daily and the oil upon you, ever fresh.
3126 2018-02-03 16:55:27 And no, no oil. Which means I presume not till Monday *shivers*
3127 2018-02-03 16:55:26 Tia: get a q-tip & some Johnson baby shampoo (tearless). Dab a little on the end & rub it on the sty area. U have built up oil on ur eyelid
3128 2018-02-03 16:55:23 Thanks Jaswinder for booking a Oil And Filter Change with #Fiix for your Land Rover!  #Woodbridge #Toronto #Tech
3129 2018-02-03 16:55:13 But i guess its not challenging enough for you ;) anyways thanks. Had to look up the oil pin wash and will give it a try

3131 2018-02-03 16:54:40 In terms of development, I distinguish several unique facts. Oil and gas resources can be the prime mover economy and digitalization does.
3132 2018-02-03 16:54:29 //Feeling a bit better, at least. Humidifier/oil diffuser is doing wonders for my ability to breathe.
3133 2018-02-03 16:54:18 Douche bag! Hey  here’s a good idea  my friend. Open up the oil fields in untouched wilderness to help me gain some  and I’ll give you some  for helping us out! Sound good? Wait! Animals and environment.. they can deal with it! ..Douche Bags!
3134 2018-02-03 16:54:12 @CalvinHelin check out Vivian Krause on US funded campaign to land -lock canadian oil exactly what u have been saying but u got to get this message out to more people because it's hard to believe this is happening

3136 2018-02-03 16:54:07 If olive oil is made from olives and vegetable oil is made from vegetables is baby oil made from babies? #funny
3137 2018-02-03 16:53:57 What a joke Venezuela cant even make money with their oil, their people are starving, yet they are going to bypass the dollar!?
3138 2018-02-03 16:53:51 I’ve tried lots but my favorites are Aveda’s Shampure. Since it isn’t a spray it’s a powder it doesn’t weigh my thick hair down and it really absorbs the oil where as I always felt like I needed a lot of an aerosol one. It’s pricy but I’ve had it since May and still using

3140 2018-02-03 16:53:49 It is time to relax and hang out at Firestone while I get the oil change completed on my #Dodge #Dakota this afternoon.
3141 2018-02-03 16:53:44 lol I get annoyed about that kind of stuff to with my mom. Like I already get stressed as well, why does she gotta add oil to the fire as well?
3142 2018-02-03 16:53:42 When an army air force etal does not have fuel for mobility
See, Germans destroyed by Russia over battle for oil
3143 2018-02-03 16:53:36 I need to get back into doing full wash days-shampoo, clarify with ACV, hot oil treatment, deep conditioner with banana baby food, honey, and olive oil and lastly, styling...

Ok happy Saturday!
3150 2018-02-03 16:52:18 Indeed.  They have several ways of enforcing this.  1. Taxes, 2. Legal tender in the largest economy in the world, 3. Oil priced in dollars
3151 2018-02-03 16:52:07 USS Pennsylvania (SSBN-735) in 2012 Reactor was refueled for an estimated 25 more years of service why do we need oil
3152 2018-02-03 16:52:02 I'm still seeing people complain that some people with these bonuses are 'only getting $200'
That's groceries for a month for a couple!
That's an oil change and gas/commute fare for 1-3 months depending on commute!
That's electric AND water for my family of 7!
3153 2018-02-03 16:51:51 Clean oil*, get with the terms of the time man!
3154 2018-02-03 16:51:36 kebalik nomor 3 dan 2, hada labo itu produk jepang. di jepang lotion itu diartikan sebagai toner jadi hada labo dl baru benton lalu serum kalo ada baru facial oil lalu moisturizer

3156 2018-02-03 16:51:15 There is an old oil storage tank under the driveway... for I guess oil powered devices?
3157 2018-02-03 16:51:13 You have trust issues with women??? 
I have a nervous breakdown every time I take my dodge to get the oil changed. I look like an over protective mother taking her child to school for the first time
3158 2018-02-03 16:51:04 HAHA I literally just dropped my car off for an oil change and they’re 100% going to tell me I need new tires and a flush and a million other things. sorry I’m poor right now maybe next time!
3159 2018-02-03 16:51:03 I added a couple drops of essential oil to Epsom salt for him. It helps soothe and detox 
3160 2018-02-03 16:50:52 We know it's oil they want and nothing else.
3161 2018-02-03 16:50:51 Is the oil pipeline finished yet? I guess if you guys defeated “actually” 100% of ISIS the war would be over.
3162 2018-02-03 16:50:51 @KushGods101 can I get some cannabis oil from you guys?

3168 2018-02-03 16:49:47 First day sale beli cleansing oil Simple. Second day, beli deodorant spray je, tu pun rembat sampai dua. Third day, ingat nak tengok2 je. Menipuuuu sempat ambil sleeping mask L'oreal Paris :')))))))) send halp send me money
3169 2018-02-03 16:49:33 Yep, we have three chapters on this - one on body changes, one on food/diet and one on exercise. And also another part-chapter on avoiding snake oil sellers...
3170 2018-02-03 16:49:28 Gue dulu beli ini pas promo, nga rela 2.5ml 130k. Abis itu move pake yg oil 
3171 2018-02-03 16:49:23 Still means that I am approx £10 down in money :-( but I have purchased...beard conditioner, beard shampoo, nail clippers, double pack of Fishermen's Friend's lozenges, olive oil, a 7 day pill organiser, crisps, a health book written by Michael Van Straten. Not bad I suppose.
3172 2018-02-03 16:49:13 It's like competition between oil companies, doesn't really show up at the pumps. And that is because we all need gas and we all need insurance.

3175 2018-02-03 16:48:43 I also need a reward for sitting at the dealership for decades for an oil change 
3176 2018-02-03 16:48:34 We've been taken over by the multinational oil cartels basically.
3177 2018-02-03 16:48:32 Please help, I just tried making this recipe from your book, all I've ended up with is 50/50 oil and tomato mix

3186 2018-02-03 16:47:28 But you also have to help those who honestly need help too. Can never forget the single moms balancing work/time with children, elderly whose checks are seeing practically no uptick while food prices skyrocket after the tax cut and yes food prices/oil skyrocketed after tax cut.

3202 2018-02-03 16:46:12 Why do you ignore the requests of multiple governors to exempt their states from you nasty oil rigs? Do you honestly think that people want to spend thousands of dollars on ocean front rentals to look at oil rigs that have the potential to ruin a coastline with a spill? And.....
3203 2018-02-03 16:46:12 almost time for a oil change
3204 2018-02-03 16:46:00 Oh I agree with that. I am just entertained that many conservative supporters blame oil prices, the recession, & the world economy on Notley, with the "she hates oil" phrase, & now they are all sputtering.

3210 2018-02-03 16:45:47 When in doubt, just use coconut oil
3211 2018-02-03 16:45:46 I'm a little concerned that your house uses oil, and in 2 locations...

3216 2018-02-03 16:44:54 Why is he? Is Saudi Arabia? They commit crimes against humanity and deny women basic human rights and they do so on a massive scale. They invaded Yemen for the oil fields. So, tell me precisely why Russia is the enemy and Saudi Arabia isn't?
3217 2018-02-03 16:44:53 Eaxctly. If Trump were a Putin lackey he wouldn't be continuing the Obama Admin's rapacious policies of fossil fuel exploration and exploitation under the imperative of "strategic energy independence", He'd be purchasing Russian Oil and gas and asking Europe to do the same.

3235 2018-02-03 16:43:30 the way to get paid; don’t wait 7monthe, make it the none payment public and the companies pay; this is the new reality, squeaky wheel gets the oil, and bad press is the squeak*
3236 2018-02-03 16:43:27 Opinion: Alaska oil fields are conveniently close 2 Russia. Russia is HUGE, & needs A LOT of energy 2 sustain itself=of course they wanted indirect control of it 4 decades & need it now more than ever.

3239 2018-02-03 16:43:06 Guess you don’t,because lowering tax mean more people work, more people spend, more tax, on top of the tax from CORP when we sell oil and natural gas over seas that we couldn’t do under Obama , honestly 1% = Trillions
3240 2018-02-03 16:43:03 Amazing how she can do this !!! Get well . Tea with ginger ,lemon ,clove and cinnamon. Essential oil diffuser at night .
3241 2018-02-03 16:41:56 it’s takes maybe 10 minutes max. Since my skin is so clear rn , i moisturize then go in with a face oil, some highlighter on my  nose and then a gloss or a lipstick depending on how i feel

3247 2018-02-03 16:41:44 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
3248 2018-02-03 16:41:43 And then sell it to oil and gas companies
3249 2018-02-03 16:41:29 whenever i used it, the flour just stayed white.. 
Did you put some oil on there?
3250 2018-02-03 16:41:25 The one strong correlated factor for voters who chose Trump was desire for authoritarian rule. They believe what the snake oil salesman tells them.
3251 2018-02-03 16:41:16 CAA creating #timesup is like if Exxon was like “oil is bad, everyone should stop allowing it to be drilled.”

3253 2018-02-03 16:40:58 Car Tips -- With the hustle and bustle of today's world its hard to find time to do the little things that make a big difference.  Remembering to change oil regularly along with checking air filters can keep your vehicle running great for a lot longer.

3255 2018-02-03 16:40:56 Health Tips: find out the oxidation index of the oil you cook with, and choose the lowest number combined with the highest smoke point.

3257 2018-02-03 16:40:48 Seems like these photos are becoming a marketing ploy to attract oil and gas clearly the people are speaking and if say the general consensus is, Dept of Interior are not representing us or our children.

3263 2018-02-03 16:39:58 Eco-terrorist-  Oil companies that annex lands with the help of apartheid CDN governments while terrorizing the peoples with contaminated water supplies and farm lands from eventual oil spills.

PM Harper was trying to turn Canadians into human shields with forced annexation

3267 2018-02-03 16:39:49 Trillions of dollars in oil profits can be a big deal. I have always thought that was the center of the whole thing
3268 2018-02-03 16:39:43 Watching #GoodEats #MajorPepper & am horrified that the mango sorbet includes ¼ tsp of black pepper essential oil. Not safe! EOs aren’t safe for internal use; that much can be toxic. Use pepper infused oil. Shame on you, @altonbrown
3269 2018-02-03 16:39:20 Im getting my oil changed all by myself~~~~ I'm so grown up~~~

3277 2018-02-03 16:38:16 Gorgeous! Have used it on my hands in the past but an oil specially for the face sounds brilliant! Thank you! x
3278 2018-02-03 16:38:09 If there wasn’t power to be gained from killing people, forcing them from their lands for oil, the fuel for more unnecessary consumption, there wouldn’t be reactionary forces like nazis and terrorists to lash out aimlessly against those horizontal to them.
3279 2018-02-03 16:37:39 Build up your immune system with vitamin C, garlic capsules, oil of oregano capsules, colloidal silver, apple cider vinegar. I hope you feel better!

3282 2018-02-03 16:37:11 The right wing in Alberta are such hypocrites. They have spent the last 2 years screaming that Notley hates the oil industry. They don't know what to do with Notley and Trudeau both fighting for the pipeline.

3301 2018-02-03 16:34:40 @CBCNews I love weekends with @MichaelSerapio but he's clearly spouting bias over the pipeline story.  Yes there have been pipeline spills, but far fewer and with less damage then rail oil cars. A pipeline would finally allow CANADA to sell its oil at a fair market value.
3302 2018-02-03 16:34:38 Yg tu laa aq nak. Oil control kn..
3303 2018-02-03 16:34:29 Was expecting a long line at Jiffy Lube to get my oil changed and there is not. First car in line after the ones already in being done 
3304 2018-02-03 16:34:10 Oil and gas you complete loony.
3305 2018-02-03 16:34:10 And essential oil in a humidifier all night . Get well
3306 2018-02-03 16:34:06 I agree that Jenkins (sorting out the balance of payments mess left by the Tories in 1964), Healey (reducing inflationary effects of the Barber boom and the quadrupling of oil prices), and Clarke (repairing the damage after Lamont's 'Black Wednesday') were effective chancellors.
3307 2018-02-03 16:34:00 Oil is so damn expensive

3404 2018-02-02 23:53:07 Truly one of the biggest struggles of working in oil refineries, power plants, and pipeline, is keeping a clean vehicle. It’ll never happen. Always muddy or dusty

3412 2018-02-02 23:52:07 Funny thing is, I never wanted to be a defender of @realDonaldTrump. check my TL & you will see I was #NeverTrump during the primary. But this insanity by the leftists and #MSM has led me to see what's best for America, and it's sure not whatever snake oil they're selling.
3413 2018-02-02 23:51:53 That will do it.

3419 2018-02-02 23:50:21 Yesterday, we had a diesel oil spill in Howe Sound, which is now being cleaned up. Guess who owns the cleanup company -- Kinder Morgan. They know where the money is.
3420 2018-02-02 23:49:59 If a shift towards none oil economy is not reached soon these figures would drop dramatically and the country will not offered to allocate the 52% salary portion of the budget that is currently is eating our income In simpler terms the country will not be able to pay the salaries
3421 2018-02-02 23:49:50 I need new brakes, an oil change and renew my registration. I hate adulthood!
3422 2018-02-02 23:49:42 This isn't about the 'rest of Canada' of even YOU, this is about Alberta wanting profits and BC inheriting ALL of the risks. An oil spill would decimate our environment and economy. It's not going to happen. BC will stop #KinderMorgan

3451 2018-02-02 23:45:21 Ok, interesting. We didn’t use oil and did the final proof overnight in the fridge.
3452 2018-02-02 23:45:09 Oil I love YOU
3453 2018-02-02 23:45:09 Oil is renewable. All energy is renewable. Whether it is renewed in our lifetime or in a million years, it’s still renewable.
3454 2018-02-02 23:44:50 President Trump :  The Prices of the oil is too higth. we need your help. please..
3455 2018-02-02 23:44:38 Good evening. Whilst it may not always be obvious why a lane is closed (eg: there may be a defect or an oil/diesel spill or debris in that lane). I assure you it is done for a good reason and from a position of road user and/or worker safety.
3456 2018-02-02 23:44:31 Something might be wrong with his account!
3457 2018-02-02 23:44:10 Agree: *ALL* oil gets dumped/spilled/littered into our environment after we use it. And 0% cleaned up. Amount of liquid oil spilled is tiny in comparison. Also, I wasn't saying bitumen was different...you were! Nobody has cleaned up *ANY* of the 2 Gt of bitumen in oceans.
3458 2018-02-02 23:44:07 If it was to protect us then that’s democratic. If it’s for oil and money *cough Iraq cough* thats stealing. I know a book that has a shit load of teachings about these topics that we swear into office on that comes 2nd to everyone’s politics.
3459 2018-02-02 23:44:00 So my blonde dried my ends and had my hair looking pretty rusty lol, the things Mayo and olive oil can do guys LOL

3461 2018-02-02 23:43:48 $XOM $CVX earning was bad. It clearly show that demand is low and margin are low, The sector hedge at 55 so they don't get all the upside in oil. No one see long term growth 10y at 2.7% is a killer you got to discount the cash flow and they all run on high dept.
3462 2018-02-02 23:43:43 Who was offered participation in business deals in Saudi Arabia and with Exxon Oil ie, and promised laundered wealth for helping trump!! @AdamSchiffCA @AdamSchiffCA .. Putin pacified opponents and motivated friends with wealth when he seized that country!!

3470 2018-02-02 23:43:00 ya. except BC is holding the cost of cleanup by itself. It's all good for rest of canada to say FUCK BC when they don't have a cent of risk. $600 billion cash deposit for BC when the oil spill happens (bitumen). Do you see anyone doing that? no. they want to fuck BC over.

3474 2018-02-02 23:42:19 We cannot see a Saudi Arabia we did not buy oil from for comparison, but regardless, principles don’t survive going without oil nor refusing to sell arms do they? We will have to agree to disagree, as you say.
3475 2018-02-02 23:42:11 indeed seems RAF been busy, would be interesting to see what command are going to do with our NATO allies Turkey 2 hats oil black market Daesh funds ,coupled with there war on our friends the kurds, all said and done we did invade Iraq to save them.

3482 2018-02-02 23:41:35 It’s not about oil patch jobs as much as giving Beijing what it wants

Notice how 

- cozy Trudeau and gang are with Beijing
- China’s State Owned Enterprises are buying up distressed oil patch assets
- China now largest oil importer
3483 2018-02-02 23:41:25 any more than Turkey could claim Arab oil.
“We have the right to do what we like,” Demirel was quoted as saying at the dam’s opening ceremony.
Turkey has been contemplating selling water to countries having a short supply such as Israel.
3484 2018-02-02 23:41:23 Then put up a $600 billion CASH DEPOSIT for the people of BC to clean up the oil spill. What's that? you can't? then ya, no. #kindermorgan not happening you goofball. not now. not ever.

3499 2018-02-02 23:39:13 Whe was it pressed for a huge increase in tax credits for those companies because they were no longer making money on extraction because of the oil price? Wait for it ..... John Swinney.
3500 2018-02-02 23:39:12 I’ve been using argan oil for a while now and I love it but my body wants to be allergic to it now so yay 
3501 2018-02-02 23:39:11 ya. but then again, Alberta isn't prepared to give BC a $600 billion CASH DEPOSIT for use when the oil spill happens, is it? so how about shutting up you little pissant
3502 2018-02-02 23:38:58 This is nice, it's like a poem! And I agree whole heartedly! I want to shut down oil production and coal but I want those people to have great green jobs instead! There is unlimited growth in changing to a green future! And a healthier work environment for all! #begreen

3505 2018-02-02 23:38:24 TX so much! We need more solidarity from international unions. We hope you can give us RT and  tell them about subcontracting and ilegal intermediation in Colombia. Specially in the CO. From palm oil #INDUPALMA #ISupportStrike

3515 2018-02-02 23:37:32 Sigh, morons such as yourself who happily take advantage of all the amenities that oil and gas revenues produce ie health care, social programs etc and yet whine and moan about the very product that provides those amenities...the only word to describe you is "stupid" I'm afraid.

- Unique because its backed by the biggest oil reserves in the world
- 55% raised put into a Sovereign fund for the state (for incentivizing a digital currency)

I'd love to try your face oil, BUT I don't want that chance to come because you let me not follow the guidelines you put up for the opportunity. Does that make sense?
3529 2018-02-02 23:35:22 I just got blocked by someone for saying that building pipelines is the right thing. Maybe she was a oil-by-rail supporter?
3530 2018-02-02 23:35:20 Guess none if them drive cars wear make up of use any oil based products.
3531 2018-02-02 23:35:09 WM dictates oil price now ? First oil is a “bonus”, now this ?  Let’s get this straight - it was the SNP who OVERESTIMATED  oil revenues (by £6.8BN) - no one else.
3532 2018-02-02 23:35:08 Faye i have a question. Where do you expect the money to come from to subsidize all your programs without oil. Btw pipelines are way less riskier than trains. So would you have trains
3533 2018-02-02 23:34:46 We have had our fair share of terrorism over the years, we dont want breeding ground for fundamentalists and extremists. Please Iran, keep your oil money and the price that follows in your country. We don't want anything to do with Hezbola!
3534 2018-02-02 23:34:44 I’d suggest you look at Germany’s problems with infrastructure, slow internet speeds, desire for Russian oil and gas and a complete unwillingness to defend either itself or its NATO allies east of the Oder/Neisse.
3535 2018-02-02 23:34:12 glad i dropped brandy off at 11 this morning to get an oil change and she’s still not done

3540 2018-02-02 23:33:09 I tend to #gheekout with @OrganicValley at #shiftcon.  They're so punny and encouraging! Oil try harder to do them proud.
3541 2018-02-02 23:32:32 Pls,reach out to Schneiderman w/your Indian contacts,so that Eric& his AG's understand that there's more at risk for drilling/mining than in NY. #BearEars will be reduced by 85% &Bryce Canyon &Grand Canyon will be drilled for uranium & oil. This is the Indian's land @MarkRuffalo
3542 2018-02-02 23:32:25 Looks like it might rain and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

3546 2018-02-02 23:31:41 You know I really wonder how much oil paint I've absorbed into my bloodstream at this point
3547 2018-02-02 23:31:37 I’m going to be stranded up in the northend tomorrow while my car gets an oil change if anybody wants to meet for lunch…

3550 2018-02-02 23:31:12 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.
3551 2018-02-02 23:31:04 This would hold true if it weren't riddled with falsehoods. I oppose the expansion of oil. The product being shipped is for foreign markets. I'm for refinement in Canada, for Canadians. There is no need for this expansion other than for corporate greed.
3552 2018-02-02 23:31:02 There is no way to prevent oil spills from Pipelines, Rail Cars Sea going Tankers - These have happened and will continue to happen - There is only one way to Save the BC Coast No Oil Tankers !

3557 2018-02-02 23:30:44 I suspect when we see Corrupt Trump you will regret saying he was not Corrupt.  What he is doing is increasing our dependence on foreign oil and oil in general to enrich the dictatorships including Putin at the expense of diversification of our energy resources.

3562 2018-02-02 23:30:32 It’s never ever been a problem before but on Jan 3rd they only filled it to 75% full which I thought was odd given how cold it had been and would be. Generators must be hogging the oil
3563 2018-02-02 23:30:23 I get it for free. Got a Care Package when I leased it. So technically not free but I don't have to pay anything when I get an oil change.
3564 2018-02-02 23:30:16 Green beans sautéed with garlic in olive oil and topped with toasted almonds ... We're all hung up on the green beans portion of Bill's program. :)
3565 2018-02-02 23:30:15 Two tins of chick peas, 6 tbsp of olive oil, one lemon juice, one crushed garlic, 4 tbsp of tahini, 1 teaspn of salt, juice from one of the chickpea tins and blend to a fine paste. Makes two tubs.

3568 2018-02-02 23:29:42 Dinner idea: chicken breast seasoned w black pepper, garlic salt, &amp; bread crumbs. Squash & broccoli, light olive oil. Bake 415 ~35min.
3569 2018-02-02 23:29:29 I literally treat coconut oil as if it could cure my anxiety and life problems I use it for everything
3570 2018-02-02 23:29:03 ordered 7 days before last cold snap/mega storm. 4 missed deliveries (30 phone calls, no exaggeration). then said they delivered (and charged us) but no oil. Guy at company told me my fuel gauge must be broken. New company now, fingers crossed for delivery next week

3576 2018-02-02 23:28:08 with the decline of the dollar shouldn't oil be going up
3577 2018-02-02 23:28:03 And if you're that worried about the environment try doing something about animal agriculture. It's far worse for the environment than oil and gas could ever be.
3578 2018-02-02 23:28:00 I just wanna know when I called to get an appointment to get my oil changed they tell me they are to busy and can’t do it till Monday but JohnMark calls them an hour later and says who he is and magically they can most definitely see me wtf?

3586 2018-02-02 23:26:39 Hypocrite because you've stated not in your backyard. You want the benefits of oil, as long as you don't have to deal with the consequences. We have covered this several times but you haven't been smart enough to read or comprehend it. Catch ya later clown

3596 2018-02-02 23:24:31 well in BC it might be  a migration cause oil companies like kinder Morgan will not protest, in 2003 the bc government ripped up union contracts and there almost a general strike
3597 2018-02-02 23:24:26 This reminds me of Madelaine Albright saying that sanctioning 500,000 Iraqi children to death was I think by "worth it" she was referring to oil & contracts for corporations & the MIC respectively. The worst among us pursue power, sometimes succeed but inevitably abuse it.
3598 2018-02-02 23:24:25 Rachel, you astonish me - your sell out to big oil & your adoption of their bully tactics has limited your vision on what Alberta could and has to be without oil.

3645 2018-02-02 23:17:51 So, based on Trump’s activities, he wants more nuclear weapons and coal, less solar power and national parks. More offshore oil rigs, less clean water. More nazis, less decency. He’s pretty much pure evil.

3665 2018-02-02 23:14:37 Don’t recall hearing an explanation. Rumour was he was brought in via Jeff Sessions or Manafort. No good explanation for Rex Tillerson either. Trump didn’t know him. Still think Exxon oil/gas reserves in Russia is part of this. And weren’t both Page and Papadopolous energy guys?
3666 2018-02-02 23:14:33 a friend just called asking me for a can of motor oil and a plunger. I can't wait to find out why
3667 2018-02-02 23:14:31 I saw the Live IG and howfolks were trying to throw oil in the fire. I saw how they told ypu Kail had tea to spill. KAIL NEVER SAID YPUR NAME. you directed it to Javi. The people are just trying to provoke you Mami. Now stop. Get it 2gether. Ya'll making me go crazy!
3668 2018-02-02 23:14:30 My GP encouraged me to take calcium, my optometrist suggested fish oil. I appreciate their willingness to consider all options for health.

3675 2018-02-02 23:13:20 We got off topic. Their job is not to try to influence the market or have an agenda outside of unbiased accuracy of oil/other energy supply/demand etc. forecasts. So they are either incompetent or they have an agenda.
3676 2018-02-02 23:13:14 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
3677 2018-02-02 23:13:11 I need cbd oil in my life
3678 2018-02-02 23:12:30 this might be it! i'm fairly sure that chocolate oranges, or at least the ones i get for christmas, use orange oil in the chocolate
3679 2018-02-02 23:12:25 I'd give absolutely anything to cover your perfect sexy naked body in oil and then lick off Tara
3680 2018-02-02 23:12:14 i can still check it out ty!!! idk like my skin is rly dry usually but then i try to moisturize & im just    oil slick for the rest of the day why th
3681 2018-02-02 23:11:18 Probably orange oil vs flavoring? Certain things use citrus oil instead of citrus juice extracts / artificial citrus (and IMO they're way better).
3682 2018-02-02 23:11:15 It should be about as thick as motor oil so it can stick to the ball and the paper. Instead, an artist paints an elaborate design.
3683 2018-02-02 23:11:12 Down day in the market. It was only one day so don't draw too much from this, but QCLN (clean energy ETF) -2.23% and XLE (oil & gas ETF) - 4.19% Just sayin'. @CleanEdgeInc #climatechange
3684 2018-02-02 23:11:12 Every Saturday? Seems a bit excessive.

I’ll change his oil every 6,000 miles, but that’s as far as I can go. 
3685 2018-02-02 23:11:07 this looks just like oil pastel!
3686 2018-02-02 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: raw crust with sweet motor oil and spinach.
3687 2018-02-02 23:11:03 FOR SOAP MAKING OIL IS REQUIRED,  BUT TO CLEAN OIL SOAP IS REQUIRED,  THAT IS IRONY OF LIFE, (Obrempong sikapa Anim).
3688 2018-02-02 23:10:48 @RallySportTweet Ordered my oil Wednesday evening and payed for 2day shipping. Not going to be here till Monday night now. Anything you can do about this? Talk to you guys on the phone but they tried to say I ordered it on the first.
3689 2018-02-02 23:10:46 is Kaduna refinery working?

Does it not use Venezuelan oil?
3690 2018-02-02 23:10:30 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
3691 2018-02-02 23:10:28 But my god, that's a lot of money. It has to be a good investment... good thing we have experts who can do the math, calculate the risk, and negotiate with the oil companies. And a premier who can stand her ground. Like her or not, it can't be an easy job.
3692 2018-02-02 23:10:22 I'm sick of him!  He doesn't care about the people only the corps, banks, oil ind, because he makes money.  #trumpSewerRat
3693 2018-02-02 23:10:22 And sell off our monuments for drilling! Happening TODAY! #MonumentsForAll #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018
They are stealing our lands to give to big oil as a thank you for the money for GOP campaigns. 
3694 2018-02-02 23:10:20 Damnit why am I getting an oil change
3695 2018-02-02 23:10:19 #cknw #kindermorgan The ONLY way the pipeline gets approved is if the Federal Government can prove oil tanker traffics will never spill oil into Salish Sea. Can't. Therefore it's provincial jurisdiction to protect property rights from damage. #pnpcbc
3696 2018-02-02 23:10:06 Or return anything made outside of Canada cause most is brought in on huge massive ships that spill gas, oil, sewage and many other bad things into the watter. Do your part Jeff
3697 2018-02-02 23:10:02 Nossa qndo escuto midnight oil só lembro dentro do carro com meus pais procurando onda
3698 2018-02-02 23:10:00 bro the car exploded when i was leaving the shop after oil change 
3699 2018-02-02 23:09:40 Haha. Noted. But, again, it's not really that gross. Most cakes have eggs and oil in the batter recipes. Mayo is just a shortcut.
3700 2018-02-02 23:09:15 huh. what if oil price drops to the point where it can't be extracted profitably? would a country leave it in the ground then?
3701 2018-02-02 23:09:01 Keep dreaming. Meanwhile Russian oil barges are moored in Boston despite sanctions supposedly barring them. Meanwhile 3 top Russian intel officials were allowed into the US, 1 of whom was supposed to be barred from entry. Nothing suspicious there, right? #QuidProQuo
3702 2018-02-02 23:08:51 Protesting oil is getting super old and lame.
3703 2018-02-02 23:08:39 Another large group of five or six. Town hall schedule - snake oil salesman?
3704 2018-02-02 23:08:36 @PnPCBC Canadian oil is selling at a discount because theres an oil glut and Alberta Tar Sands are stranded assets
3705 2018-02-02 23:08:34 I fw Express Oil Change. Mechanic fwm on a charger because my shit was on 5%
3706 2018-02-02 23:08:33 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
3707 2018-02-02 23:08:31 When I turned the generator off,  he asked who sang the track? 
I answer FIRMAN and PETROL beat by MOBILE LUBRICANT OIL.
#saynotoalcohol
3708 2018-02-02 23:08:30 I'm not buying it, it sounds like you've bought into the snake oil. Bernie was cheated, Obama bankrupted the DNC and Hillary bought the super delegates, Dem's rich donors are scared of socialists.
3709 2018-02-02 23:08:27 I Need A Oil Change (BMW) Who Got Me ?
3710 2018-02-02 23:08:25 @PnPCBC Alberta oil is discounted because the quality is low and the refining costs at the Gulf Coast end are high The USA is stuck with handling the dillutant at the end
3711 2018-02-02 23:08:19 @elonmusk Cape Town is a nice place to solve water problems and make Southern Africa a nice place to live.  Water is more important, and profitable than oil when it comes to people and the agriculture needed to support Cape Town.
3712 2018-02-02 23:08:16 Did you have coffee creamer this week? Cool Whip? If you did, those are examples of edible oil products. Oil is hydrocarbons, that is food. Once we finish burning it we'll just use it to feed people.
3713 2018-02-02 23:08:16 Cracked my oil pan #lowlife
3714 2018-02-02 23:08:06 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
3715 2018-02-02 23:07:57 يارب
3716 2018-02-02 23:07:56 OK so back to @brianlilley comment. Why are environmentalist driving cars to their protests?  

We need oil to fuel social change.  We need oil to fuel the factories that will build  new technologies.  And in Canada, we need oil to pay for our health care.  1/2
3717 2018-02-02 23:07:53 I think the “environmental” drawback to Proof of Work is a very overrated topic. If you add up the total amount of resources a person/group uses, it’s always going to sound insane. The average American uses a third of a barrel or 14 gallons of oil a day.
3718 2018-02-02 23:07:46 Rearranging the stu, got booked for a gig, lemon jasmine essential oil + palo santo burning, having my mom over for homemade pho later
3719 2018-02-02 23:07:39 Crude oil per barrel Manmohan time lo highest undi aina price tagginchadu.. Adhe crude oil Modi time lo lowest undi aina prices penchadu. It doesn't apply what you said in this context.

3721 2018-02-02 23:07:30 Me neither, honestly. I was surprised when I saw him do it and decided to give it a shot. I mean, it makes sense, really. Mayo really is just egg yolks and oil. It's the same principle behind it being used in some cake recipes.
3722 2018-02-02 23:07:21 A 318,000 metric ton oil tanker is not part of nature. That is the interference. We already have enough of those ships in our waters and increasing them 7x will only make a disaster inevitably. If you're so confident, then sign on to commit your money to the clean up fund.
3723 2018-02-02 23:06:51 so you've seen me mixing Oil of Abramelin
3724 2018-02-02 23:06:49 Is it possible for my skin to lactate oil
3725 2018-02-02 23:06:48 Tea tree oil is rapidly becoming the solution to all my problems. Bad skin? Tea tree oil. Greasy hair? Tea tree oil. Life rapidly falling apart with little direction?

Tea tree oil.
3726 2018-02-02 23:06:36 Let's solve Cape Town SA water problem by increasing water desalination efficiency factors 10X (Israel is a world leader) and making it a private commercial enterprise for all of Southern Africa.  Water is more important than oil.
3727 2018-02-02 23:06:13 Honestly, Black caster oil changed my life
3728 2018-02-02 23:05:58 Correction, every time. Every time I take oil of oregano.... 

Any tips? 
3729 2018-02-02 23:05:56 Oil money while Sudanese ground people suffer 
..this is not on  #socialdevelopment
3730 2018-02-02 23:05:45 お仕事
3731 2018-02-02 23:05:26 First time taking oil of oregano, “only four drops? I’ll do a few extra”

....

Almost chokes, gags, dang near dies, and then smells like Italian food for the next 24hours
3732 2018-02-02 23:05:05 Well I got hit up about my wallet I lost back in August and it had an oil & has check in it. Then I found a 20 in a pair of jeans. 
3733 2018-02-02 23:04:14 ぽきた
3734 2018-02-02 23:04:03 Where can I get some almond oil for like lips and skin and shit ?
3735 2018-02-02 23:03:57 I marinated it in spices, vinegar and oil for 24 hours then seared it in the Instant Pot, then cooked for an hour on meat/stew. Pretty easy. Just need a better spice blend.
3736 2018-02-02 23:03:55 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
3737 2018-02-02 23:03:48 I'm sure you'll be selling the land rights at the memorial to your oil and gas bosses soon, traitor.
3738 2018-02-02 23:03:45 il paraît qu’il il a été confondu pour une cicatrice il ne regarde pas la pub le tariq il ne connaît pas bi oil la petite huile qui efface les cicatrices 
3739 2018-02-02 23:03:45 we'll always need fossil fuels. And we'll get that from the least environmentally damaging way - Saudi Arabia. California. Don't need oil sands. it's stupid
3740 2018-02-02 23:03:37 普通に寒いですけど
3741 2018-02-02 23:03:18 1st, it's OILSANDS you imbecile. 2nd, where does BC oil come from?

3745 2018-02-02 23:03:01 If Putin can destroy Western Alliances that keep him from his oil, he can get what he wants. He can also make Russia a Super Power again (in his mind) He gets great benefit by destroying our countries. Most of those helping him are connected to Russia in some way or the Oligarchs
3746 2018-02-02 23:02:52 I agree with oil demand. I just see it as a result of population growth and phasing out of coal, not so much because of the economy. We will see if Trump doesn't undermine the growth with some of these trade policies.
3747 2018-02-02 23:02:47 I bought a big ass thing of coconut oil cause, self love lmao my skin needs to be poppin again i been slackin on taking care of myself lol mainly because a bitch is broke
3748 2018-02-02 23:02:47 The entire GOP is in with big oil
3749 2018-02-02 23:02:33 This is fire. Is this Oil or Acrylic?
3750 2018-02-02 23:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
3751 2018-02-02 23:02:28 it's because the BBC are a tax payer funded propaganda machine with old parts, dirty oil and a lot of "left" over parts. basically they are the worst shit in the world, worse than Meryl Streep
3752 2018-02-02 23:02:10 Grape seed oil helps my skin a ton.
3753 2018-02-02 23:02:08 Failing to supply them with oil to realize that crucial environmental milestone could be seen as a act of aggression, why would their money be less valuable than others. It's not that we should diversify our economy, we have to for global stability.
3754 2018-02-02 23:01:49 Wow what an amazing turnout with the volunteers for the Aura Skin oil!! I have PLENTY to choose from~ Ill just make it a mini-ga with those of you that DMd me pics already. Sound good?? Ill pick next weekThankyou to everyone wanting to help!
3755 2018-02-02 23:01:49 MRO? They have 420MMboed roughly 75% oil, 75kbd hedged 1H 60 kbd second half.  If they do nothings they'll have $1.2B+ in additional cash flow at these prices..
3756 2018-02-02 23:01:38 Problem is Canada doesn’t want to be held hostage to BC voters. Many want oil exported. Harper couldn’t solve it, I guess JT may not?
3757 2018-02-02 23:01:31 It's a cut throat world out there. Perform or get a seat. Shey na till we discover oil before we go reshuffle the pack abi??
3758 2018-02-02 23:01:29 I grew up in West Van and thus know that local salmon runs are small compared with Fraser River but yes there are some, espy to Capilano River hatchery w some returning anew in Burnaby. Salmon and oil refineries CAN co-exist well if refineries control and limit their emissions.
3759 2018-02-02 23:01:14 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
3760 2018-02-02 23:01:12 ???

an oil spill and a plane crash are two different things
3761 2018-02-02 23:01:02 I'd swim in coconut oil I love it that much hahaha
3762 2018-02-02 23:00:58 Now if oil pipelines can just follow coal to their graves...
3763 2018-02-02 23:00:51 He's not the progressive. He's just really good at snake oil. We're not going back to those days where America was king and did everything itself and nobody could compete with us.
3764 2018-02-02 23:00:47 Rigs don't pump oil.
3765 2018-02-02 23:00:39 Burning the midnight oil, personal emails, tray clearing& all things one can’t do during the week. Come Saturday & Sunday, it’s chillax!
3766 2018-02-02 23:00:24 I need to get rich and have my oil glands removed because it’s out of control
3767 2018-02-02 22:59:55 We are just getting started here. The growth in oil demand will be mostly Asia and eventually Africa. Global economy is strong and will get stronger. Haven't had all major economies growing simultaneously in a long time.
3768 2018-02-02 22:59:49 More likely, people involved in funding the Liberal party have run the numbers and determined the oil industry is more likely to fund their reelection.
3769 2018-02-02 22:59:43 The zoo called Nigeria is only one because of the oil and gas from Biafra land

3772 2018-02-02 22:59:02 Y'all smoke motor oil
3773 2018-02-02 22:59:02 Just changed the oil in mommas car and I’m so proud of myself 
3774 2018-02-02 22:58:52 weh cleasing oil tu ok ke , how to apply aku nk beli ni
3775 2018-02-02 22:58:52 @meetthepress Chuck Todd seemed afraid to ask a question for fear of the answer,it was so obvious,he didn't want to do anymore damage to his right wing buddies,they all seemed like snake oil salesmen.
3776 2018-02-02 22:58:45 I don't even understand what you are trying to get across with this atrocious use of the English language. I would love for oil and gas to move over and for others to take their place. As it is now, though, the technology isn't quite there. That's the truth.
3777 2018-02-02 22:58:40 I told my mom that I had to stop using a face moisturizer bc it had coconut oil in it and she tells me "ay mija...." SHE WAS BEING NICE AND DIDNT CALL ME MENSA LMAO
3778 2018-02-02 22:58:35 Räknar med att Neste Oil helt bytt inriktning redan imorgon.
3779 2018-02-02 22:58:27 Don’t like oil drilling or wind farm. But I do like to afford to drive my car and turn the lights on
3780 2018-02-02 22:58:25 And regular movies will not impress me again. DEPICT ALL THE MOVIES IN OIL PAINTED ANIMATIONS
3781 2018-02-02 22:58:01 Let me tell you, it is so convenient that the coon valley mechanic will come get our cars from work, give us an oil change, then bring our cars back. 
3782 2018-02-02 22:57:56 Thats sosos sweet ; ~ ;  I hope to never disappoint you ! ! Im so happy I can inspire you oils are such a gorgeous medium ~ please let me see when you do an oil piece  Id love to see tehe
3783 2018-02-02 22:57:50 Women at work dead ass don’t take their vehicles to get the oil changed talking bout they just “add oil” 
3784 2018-02-02 22:57:40 Isn’t just about every BC winery either a) owned by a multinational conglomerate or b) funded by Oil rich Albertans as a hobby/retirement
3785 2018-02-02 22:57:40 I think.they spend money on QCs to find avenues to bypass Westminster create laws to get some funds put of oil.
3786 2018-02-02 22:57:39 when you go get your oil change and then leave with a paper recommending you do $1400 worth of maintenance  @Honda
3787 2018-02-02 22:57:38 Oil was down today too. One of a few good hedges for today’s selloff. Rig count is ticking higher.
3788 2018-02-02 22:57:23 #pnpcbc Trudeau is selling out Bc coast for big oil you cant clean up tar sands it sinks no to Kinder Morgan or any other pipelines! Even David Suzuki's grandkids got arrested over Kinder Morgan
3789 2018-02-02 22:57:05 The douchebaggery on the Oilers blogger side has dissipated dramatically since peak Oil Change era 4-8 years ago (we Canucks fans bore a lot of it, not entirely undeserved, but oh my was it thick). I'm talking the era of classic Derek Zona and a scrappy young @dellowhockey.
3790 2018-02-02 22:56:59 What kind of motor oil do you run in your car?
3791 2018-02-02 22:56:55 Don’t be silly - if you can help it. The oil money was spent on social services of one kind and another. You need to read something other than SNP crap and lies.
3792 2018-02-02 22:56:53 People from selden cop a foreign car from 2004 with 180,000 miles just to flex on social media for a couple months then blow their engine when they can’t afford their oil change
3793 2018-02-02 22:56:47 well building pipe lines for oil then say your tackling climate change don't make to much sense..it kinda like saying...smoking and health care..we smoke more because we are getting more money for healthcare..kinda like a dog chasing its tail
3794 2018-02-02 22:56:44 @exxonmobil scored a massive gain from the @GOP Tax Scam Bill. The tax  windfall helped Exxon's net profits surge fivefold, the world's largest  publicly traded oil company said on Friday. Exxon said the federal tax law enacted by @realDonaldTrump in December gave the company....
3795 2018-02-02 22:56:23 The Army just sent out an email saying that CBD oil is causing severe side effects from seizures to brain death so if you or anyone you know smokes it, please stop.
3796 2018-02-02 22:56:15 What JT fails to grasp and Notley as well is that pipelines and tar sands oil have no part in an effective climate change policy.  #pnpcbc
3797 2018-02-02 22:56:15 Well I have to tell everyone AMSOIL is the BEST oil you could put in your classic. Most classic cars like to be driven every few weeks to keep them going...........if your not using AMSOIL give it a try
3798 2018-02-02 22:56:09 pan seared scallops, white beans, bacon, escarole, yellowfoot chanterelles. 
   
  grilled muscovy duck hearts, blood orange, watercress, watermelon radish, quick pickled fennel, extra virgin olive oil, lemon, crouton.
3799 2018-02-02 22:56:06 The Naniamo town hall was full of anti -pipeline protestors. Trudeau isn’t anti -oil enough for them. Let that sink in.

3801 2018-02-02 22:55:48 it is all in what you eat
want to get rid of acne?
eliminate foods that cause it
for me: sugar, corn, wheat, dairy, soy
want to avoid wrinkles?
don't drink alcohol or eat sugar.
get sun but don't use toxic SP
what I put on my old face:
oil free vit c cream & water
don't waste $$$
3802 2018-02-02 22:55:27 So when this began I was sitting in motel room for 14 hrs a day while my husband drilled for oil...
from then to now I have seen progress.....I've been here everyday...good job!...
3803 2018-02-02 22:55:19 I’ve decided to walk around wearing eucalyptus essential oil like a tween boy who’s discovered his dad’s 1980s bottle of Polo.

3805 2018-02-02 22:54:59 lmaoo it was some coconut oil
3806 2018-02-02 22:54:58 Cleaned the whole apartment and cleaned up Skylers room and I’m ready for bed but still need to eat dinner and shower  plus side is I only have to do laundry tomorrow after my oil change. 
3807 2018-02-02 22:54:39 Slow increase in the oil sector- companies will not want to repeat previous crashes however. Yacht sector continuing to grow. Same with cruise but they will diversify anyway from European officers more and more.

3809 2018-02-02 22:54:36 You seem to be part of the "not in my backyard" group. Also known as hypocrites. You're more than welcome to live in nature without petroleum products and do your part to reduce the need for oil and thus reduce need for oil transport of any type

What else do you expect?  Donnie could never measure up to his dad that loaned him a wee little million dollars and then bought 3 million dollars worth of chips to bail out his failing casino.  He’s a snake oil salesman.
3813 2018-02-02 22:53:09 yeah me too, it never was a problem for me up until the fish oil
3814 2018-02-02 22:52:55 And the last thing we need is oil executive Steve Pearce to keep the lousy record going.

3817 2018-02-02 22:51:50 Heating oil still at 1/4 of a tank and apparently that worries no one but me. I hope we’re in for a warm weekend

You are in a house with an oil lamp, some newspaper and some kindling wood. If you only have one match which one do you light first?

3828 2018-02-02 22:49:38 I know. There was definitely set backs this year. I was under no impression that the Oil would be a cup contender this year. I think they have both greatly underachieved this year and overachieved last year. I think they caught a lot of teams of guard last year. Future is bright.
3829 2018-02-02 22:49:10 @theonlycwistina Yeesh. Have you taken care of the oil change?
3830 2018-02-02 22:49:00 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
3831 2018-02-02 22:48:54 The money was budgeted but not spent as far as I know. Just look at Kalamazoo, still has oil on bottom of river 7 years later. How would you suck it up from the bottom of the ocean? Does the technology even exist?
3832 2018-02-02 22:48:50 i know what bean oil SnDs are... we use way more corn for ethanol.. and that correlation sucks ass for a reason too
3833 2018-02-02 22:48:43 If you come in to an oil change shop 8 minutes before close you are an asshole. There is no way around it.
3834 2018-02-02 22:48:13 This has more to do than consumption of oil products. This about the protection of our coastal waters. There is NOTHING that can clean up an oil spill in the ocean. Diluted bitumen sinks and is incredibly toxic. It would destroy not only the ecosystem but the BC economy too
3835 2018-02-02 22:48:09 Nope plastic as usual,thermoset

3837 2018-02-02 22:47:50 I do laugh at comments like yours lets get rid of oil and build pipelines that you need oil to build them.

3839 2018-02-02 22:47:40 First of all, she do what she want - I have no control, only influence

So: less weighty product (think: light lotion, oil vs cream)

Parts in strategic places (right side, for me)

Small acts of volumizing: fingers twirling curls, non-satin pillow
3840 2018-02-02 22:47:20 In fact it was Obama that increased production domestically to drive a stake at Russia for flexing its boarders. That ultimately destroyed Venezuela among other oil dependent governments. And ultimately lowered the price by 75%.
3841 2018-02-02 22:47:10 More of a fancy cigar lighter... Flamethrowers conjure visions of streams of burning oil.
3842 2018-02-02 22:47:00 ...with olive oil in the oj. Urggggh.
3843 2018-02-02 22:46:59 He and his father were never concerned about goodwill for Alberta. Pierre’s ‘Why should I sell your wheat?’ becomes Justin’s ‘Why should i move your oil?’
3844 2018-02-02 22:46:54 James Howard Kunstler. Matthew Simmons. Richard Heinberg. You may notice a trend here. Even if all the Alaskan oil was out of the ground today and ready to use, it wouldn't last us too long at current levels of usage. And it will stay in the ground as prices force production.
3845 2018-02-02 22:46:45 wow i wish that glow on my nose was highlight but unfortunately that’s oil. anywho you’re welcome

3849 2018-02-02 22:46:11 She threatened to reduce oil/gas supply to BC. Again, it's not her coastline that is at stake, is it? BC Gov't is doing the RIGHT thing here.
3850 2018-02-02 22:45:47 The ink in @realDonaldTrump crummy $20 tax brake is not dried yet the hungry oil companies have rased the price of the gas 30c since beginning of Jan 2018 @SenWarren @Lawrence @maddow @foxandfriends
3851 2018-02-02 22:45:43 Then complain the pipeline owners and Irving Oil. You weren't told the whole story.
3852 2018-02-02 22:45:25 Like Antarctic oil, I suspect that approach will last until the discovery of the first Dilythium Crystal cache.

I thought NYT was not only about local, but international news too and the truth. # Congoleses are dying. Do you know why? Trump+Kagame=Congoleses minerals, oil, gas by stealing and kill.
3854 2018-02-02 22:45:19 Suing US oil and gas companies of course. Why doesn't he sue Iran and Iraq?
3855 2018-02-02 22:45:16 As I said Obama expanded, that actually pushed us over the line of dependence. We are less dependant on foreign oil pre 2008. And yes it was Obama that suspended oil purchasing from countries involved in terrorism... Please go read, you look foolish.

3867 2018-02-02 22:43:54 Plus he sold public lands in a land grab to corps. RT @MichaelSLinden: The TrumpTax gave $11 billion in tax cuts to 4 giant oil companies in the 4th quarter of 2017.

The entire FY2017 budget of the Environmental Protection Agency is about $8 billion.
3868 2018-02-02 22:43:32 Bought an essential oil diffuser that is bluetooth compatible and can play my music.

3869 2018-02-02 22:43:30 I gotta get an oil change ASAP
3870 2018-02-02 22:43:28 (2/2) With that being said, I can't say if it'll be a positive or negative year for stocks in 2018. I will say that they're not in a bubble. Good time to buy some dips for some great deals for some long term investments. Just avoid Amazon and Tesla though IMO.

3878 2018-02-02 22:42:27 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
3879 2018-02-02 22:42:19 (1/2) As much as I'll say oil is in a mini bubble, I won't say stocks are in a bubble. This is just a healthy correction in stocks. Remember, we have low interest rates. In the 1990s, the rate on a 30 year Treasury Bond was over 5%. Today we just reached 3 during a correction.

3883 2018-02-02 22:41:40 @GreenPartyAB/media Our oil is sold a a cut rate price because there has been only 1 refinery built in Alberta in the past 30 yrs. Who sold out our economic gain? Was it our Conservative comrades?
3884 2018-02-02 22:41:28 What shampoo were you using before? Head & Shoulders may be stripping your hair causing overproduction of oil. Otherwise may be using too much conditioner, not rinsing it out well enough, or conditioner may be too heavy for your hair type.
3885 2018-02-02 22:41:22 If youre so against oil I suggest you return any products created with petroleum.  If you quit consuming then there will be no supply needed and no pipelines. I urge you to return all electronics including your phone. I also suggest returning all appliances as well. #DontBeAClown

3890 2018-02-02 22:40:30 It was a long list. If I uploaded the full list, it could cause tribal conflict.The concentration of a tribe in the helm of affairs is too much.Was it like this during Obasanjo’s and Jonathan’s? Oil investors are the reason why we haven’t had stable electricity supply till date.
3891 2018-02-02 22:40:26 ah yes. a struggle. some good options are:

•washing twice a day w/ whatever you have available to you. even if it’s just water
keep ur pores clean!
3892 2018-02-02 22:40:18 >What if they made a new job for equality instead of firing people.

That'd be great, why would you think anyone would be against that? I mean, the name sucks, call 'em GridBoys. Better to have the names match. Maybe have them wear less than the grid girls, too. And oil them up.

3901 2018-02-02 22:39:24 The abstract does say that such a combination is rare. The key thing for me is 'undeveloped patronage networks'. The oil producing countries (and nearly all others) in Africa have extensive patronage networks, leading to strong political elite capture. Is this not right?
3902 2018-02-02 22:39:20 Just an FYI to anyone wanting a foreign car, if you get one have someone else do the fucking oil change 
3903 2018-02-02 22:38:51 Or maybe we just turn off the power to Alberta? Two can play this game @RachelNotley. Since, you're threatening to turn off our oil supply.

3913 2018-02-02 22:37:13 They don't have to pay for a military, Norway is rich with oil, they have homogeneous societies, etc... There are alot of reasons why they would have less debt. Mainly because of population size and revenue. We can bet big because we are big.
3914 2018-02-02 22:37:01 When will you admit that the man you worship is a two-bit snake oil salesman?? He is the third generation of con men. When you play with fire, you get burned. When the money trail is exposed you will all defend him and he will be disgraced. #sad
3915 2018-02-02 22:36:16 JT was certainly successful in leveraging both sides of the pipeline debate in 2015, something he won't be able to do going forward. But at the same time there are many Interior families dependent on the oil patch for employment (many pushed out of forestry due to pine beetle).
3916 2018-02-02 22:35:53 Do we not import oil? I know the “world” is not our enemy but we have enemies in this world and some of those enemies have oil.

3924 2018-02-02 22:34:36 The codes can be misleading. I have Dutch codes on Spanish products, because they are packed in The Netherlands. Better also watch out for the usual suspects: Wine, olive(oil) and citrus fruits (oranges). And of course the well known products like Serrano, Manchego, etc...

3929 2018-02-02 22:33:47 Trump and GOP think Putin will share profits from Arctic oil drilling.  They are so foolish.

3933 2018-02-02 22:33:22 I have been had!!!!!!! I’m sick of the scamming and dishonesty!!!!  I just paid $60 for a damn oil change!
3934 2018-02-02 22:33:02 Q110: British firm backed about new-fangled oil as healthy food (8)
3935 2018-02-02 22:33:01 Hey, but guess what tho?
Dirty RUS oil money smells and spends just like clean money!
WAHOOOOO Repubs!!!  You are on a winning streak!!!
3936 2018-02-02 22:33:00 It's not the oil or anything.

3941 2018-02-02 22:31:59 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
3942 2018-02-02 22:31:59 damn their dependence on oil ... too bad that is all that Alberta has to offer the world ... and, does it actually mean that Alberta will lose $2.5 billion if the pipeline is not expanded? Call me skeptical ...
3943 2018-02-02 22:31:52 Didn't your government sell of a bunch of oil sands projects to the Chinese? Aren't you advocating getting the oil to "tidewater" so that it can go to China?

3945 2018-02-02 22:31:38 They are truly trying to please Putin lately. Blatant, obvious and challenging us.  Oil tankers in Boston, ships offshore, spies with Pompeo, lawyer on tv, memo, oligarchs nearby
3946 2018-02-02 22:31:28 I would consider the leave option but for the politicians we have representing us, imagine they can't even deliver broadband. Lucky we have electricity because if it was left to the present lot, we wld still be using oil lamps and candles
3947 2018-02-02 22:31:27 Sure is. They got me. But i guess when they saw my $4 balance in my account they demanded me to borrow $20 dollars and " Mr Perry" oil company in Africa will wire the funds so me and my kids and live in nurse will have a home. Im a stroke victim so my memory is not well.
3948 2018-02-02 22:31:25 @RepMarkMeadows and his Wackadoodle Sidekick on MTP sound like DESPERATE little Snake Oil salesmen TRYING to tell us CHICKENS FLY....#TrumpCrimeFamily BULLSHIT its #MuellerTime
3949 2018-02-02 22:31:21 Yea
3950 2018-02-02 22:31:20 Americans buy Canadian oil at a 50% discount to the world price due to our pipeline constraints. Then they export their oil at full price.  Hard to convince anyone to build more refineries here with all the latest technology if we can’t even build a pipeline
3951 2018-02-02 22:31:19 Sometimes handling cutlery or metal helps, like contact with stainless steel or zinc. Lemon juice may help, but IIRC it's the oil in the orange peel that does the trick.
3952 2018-02-02 22:31:13 Let's be a bit more honest with the Scottish electorate.....IF or should I say WHEN we get our independence we are going to keep the oil...this time next year we WILL all be millionaires.  Honest!!  So tae feck wi the union! Think thats a bit strong?

The fact that our president isn’t leading this charge is evidence of his corruption

Poor excuse
3975 2018-02-02 22:27:10 They had me fooled. Ask me to load my bank card front and back. Ask me not to tell anyone. Then he asked me to borrow $20 and buy a card and " Mr. Perry" oil company in Africa will wire $$ to get us a home. My memory is delayed due to the stroke. I finally realized it was a hoax.
3976 2018-02-02 22:27:06 This is misleading... do a correlation chart with oil price n u will know
3977 2018-02-02 22:26:52 I think they put Jiffy Lubes next to Taco Bells intentionally so you can get an oil change first, then you can get gas later.
3978 2018-02-02 22:26:51 I think it is just the only possible end to frying cheese in hot oil.

3987 2018-02-02 22:25:25 oh yes! The oil!
3988 2018-02-02 22:25:23 In the last 24 hours I've: driven to Tahoe, gotten wasted on margaritas, made friends with an old guy who worked for BP Oil, patted many dogs, been sick literally every hour of the night, and straightened my hair while waiting for Subway. That's one way to start a vacation...

3992 2018-02-02 22:24:54 @VictoriaCoren did you ever get the answer as to how they extended the oil from the Goat Sucker bird?
3993 2018-02-02 22:24:47 This is called reality. Do you have heat in your house a car a bus uber. Get real unless you walk everywhere support this great leader. He is dealing with the real world not fantasy while you live a life based on gas and oil.
3994 2018-02-02 22:24:46 Can I give you a nuru / oil massage? :)
Take it from there, but I'm sure we'd both be satisfied!
3995 2018-02-02 22:24:42 I had to get my oil changed today and my car battery died, so my schedule got kind of jacked up today. 

I may have a short stream in a few hours, but no guarantees
3996 2018-02-02 22:24:30 I would never normally use oil on my face but it was so dry so I tried Nuxe oil and put it on before bed and it worked soooo well! Dry patches on my cheeks gone! I defo recommend trying a dry oil x

Endangered species? What species?
4003 2018-02-02 22:24:07 In my day we would slather on the baby oil and lie on the beach for hours.

4010 2018-02-02 22:22:52 But they aren't arguing, they are actively trying to stop the flow of "the oil that powers society today", while still relying on it.  I appreciate their environmental activism, but they are straying towards hypocrisy 1/2

What is he doing about Putin giving North Korea oil and nuclear technology? What is he doing to protect future vote.
4015 2018-02-02 22:22:10 So you think energy independence is achievable by outsourcing and allowing localized offshore drilling be extracted and not used domestically. Like Obama expanded oil drilling most not used domestically, as well. Strange everyone forgets.

4018 2018-02-02 22:22:06 And BC residents are angry! Justin sacrificing BC to dangerous Kinder Morgan pipeline while forbidding a pipeline East where Canada buys foreign oil!!!
4019 2018-02-02 22:21:56 Using hypocrisy of protesters as a valid argument against climate science or protesting in general weakens his position in my opinion. I hear nobody from Brians side of this arguing we wean ourselves off of oil in 50-100 yrs. It's mostly unhealthy skepticism of the science.
4020 2018-02-02 22:21:55 Okay, here’s a incomplete list: Carter Page met with oil giant Rosneft; Russia implemented a targeted disinfo campaign (see Twitter/Facebook reports on this); Trump has ties to businessmen in Azerbaijan, etc. And we don’t have access to classified intel, so we don’t know more.

4031 2018-02-02 22:19:56 Yes. I would look further into other alternatives other than wind and solar in place of oil and coal. The possible irreversible negative impact from an oil leak on the Virginian coast and Chesapeake Bay is not worth oil dropping another $2 a barrel.
4032 2018-02-02 22:19:56 @jjhorgan John, you have BC voters support in stopping the Alberta pipeline. We can’t risk our economic livelihood to support private Alberta oil companies

4034 2018-02-02 22:19:48 Trump has been involved in 4000 lawsuits over a period of 30 years. He manipulates the process to his own advantage. Pathetic to watch his base pledge unwavering loyalty to this snake oil salesman who doesn't reciprocate.

4047 2018-02-02 22:18:41 Transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy is expensive and needs to be funded somehow. Using carbon tax revenues is the best way to do this...the oil economy will basically fund its own death. Therefore, more oil production in the present will actually speed up transition!
4048 2018-02-02 22:18:23 I got oil all over my shoe earlier and now my toes feel really oily and gross and I’m in literal hell right now.
4049 2018-02-02 22:18:09 YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO OUR NATION, AS A HUMAN BEING, AS A "LEADER".  yOU ARE THE DISGRACE!!  You could have stopped this but instead allowed it BUT wouldn't  even take the blame by pushing it off on the Congress.  Snake Oil Salesman, Coin Artist, you name you are the lowest.
4050 2018-02-02 22:17:59 Sure, but that’s a nuanced position that I’m rarely seeing. 

In some ways my reaction is the same as my reaction to the methodology snake oil salesmen in IT.

“Methodology X is the silver bullet, it will fix all your IT delivery issues!!!”

(Insert preferred value of X)
4051 2018-02-02 22:17:36 I read somewhere once that cats will lick Vaseline to help with hairballs or something, so I assumed the oil/soap is the same sort of thing. He never pukes so maybe it works.
4052 2018-02-02 22:17:20 Not cost-effective. When costs are totalled other forms of power generation become less expensive. That doesn't include other externality costs of oil & coal that renewables don't have.

4072 2018-02-02 22:14:37 Idk.  I tried a time in between cleanings without fluoride toothpaste and regretted the effects.  I actually had staining and a very painful cleaning after 6 months of oil pulling and baking soda.  If you know a better solution, I am all ears. 
4073 2018-02-02 22:14:32 Go ahead...been thru this type of talk in Quebec where they had more of a beef that oil in the ground that goes to North Korea via China and I live in Calgary...you want to separate but do not have the guts to....ask Kenney!
4074 2018-02-02 22:14:10 That kind of stuff with wheels flying off doesn't happen in a minute that's wear and if you just have a peek behind the backing plates you'll see oil leaking or you'll see a hub leaking that indicates something I totally disagree with you bud I've been doing this for 36 years .

4087 2018-02-02 22:12:48 He was in oil and gas business and dealt with energy in Russia. He was a nobody in campaign and that’s why he was targeted. There was no clear evidence tying him to anything and that’s why that needed the dossier so that they could renew warrant. Don’t be so obtuse.
4088 2018-02-02 22:12:46 China has an oil/gas pipeline running right through Burma that ends on the Arakan coast on the Bay of Bengal. They are building port facilities and special economic zones in areas close to where Rohingyas used to live. Just saying!

4098 2018-02-02 22:11:46 Leave oil and gas ASAP, you're setting yourself up to be laid off in a cyclical industry. Not worth it anymore and no one will value your hard work.
4099 2018-02-02 22:11:37 2) The same discussions will grow about Canadian oil producers. Also, even with an update on those key pipeline decisions, closest completion on the horizon is Transmountain extension which won't be before the end of 2019.
4100 2018-02-02 22:11:34 Well done Chelsea masterful choice well it’s only oil well money lol
4101 2018-02-02 22:11:30 #WhinyLiberals are mad that Trump took 100% credit for things like lowering black unemployment, while Obama took 100% credit for things like record gas and oil development that he actively opposed, by removing federal lands from oil exploration.
4102 2018-02-02 22:11:23 Well she was in Congress all those years and she never once voted against the memo. Plus she never told Kaepernick to stand up. I'm pretty sure she didn't even fix the oil in my car. Damn that Hillary!
4103 2018-02-02 22:11:21 That looks better! Someone should tell @CNBC to round down!
4104 2018-02-02 22:11:19 Yes! I forgot pore minimizing as well. Well for this last month I’ve been using Kiehl’s starter kit. Comes with a gel cleanser night oil and cream moisturizer. Then in the morning I use a Shiseido cream cleanser and Thayers Rose toner
4105 2018-02-02 22:11:14 I agree...it is all about oil and money and sanctions and meddling with elections collusion and power and corruption and treason and quid pro quo and covering all of that up with lies known as obstruction of justice....it’s so blatantly obvious...

4108 2018-02-02 22:10:48 This shouldn’t become an “us” versus “them”. The BC govt has undermined the authority of the Feds, and all Canadians, to get our products to market. First oil, what next? NonGMO grains??? #blockade #bctradewars

I'm eating healthy & avoiding sugar which can push cancer I'm also drinking a lot of white tea. Soon here I will completely quit smoking but its been a struggle. #Cancer
4125 2018-02-02 22:08:41 1)Canada has been constantly adding oil rigs despite transportation bottlenecks. Without an update in Transmountain extension or Keystone XL, that'll be a really difficult year for the higher cost producers out there. We had that value vs growth discussions about shale producers.

4136 2018-02-02 22:07:19 haha hindsight is 20/20! down again=buy again. last i checked rising rates and Fed hikes were still good for the banks, oil was still in the $60s &earnings were still strong. Can't blame Apple for analysts hyping them to the moon - 1.3 BILLION users ready to sign up for services!
4137 2018-02-02 22:07:16 The #TaxRelief  just gave four oil companies $11 billion in the 4th quarter of 2017.

Note for perspective: that's way more than all of the one-time worker bonuses across all industries put together.
4138 2018-02-02 22:07:07 I mean, if they want electronic oil level monitoring, fine, but a manual backup would be really lovely, thanks.

4160 2018-02-02 22:04:03 This doesn’t take into account that Hemp at the time was deemed “the billion dollar crop” by many industry leaders because it was useful in making paper, replacing cotton, as well as replacing many industrial oils by use of hemp oil. Making weed illegal made hemp illegal
4161 2018-02-02 22:04:03 I was thinking less oil on the spinach would’ve made it less slimy, but arugula there  (with candied bacon?) might have been the ticket.
4162 2018-02-02 22:04:01 Have you noticed now they have the tax cuts the price of oil is skyrocketing meaning more profits for them at the expense of the consumer?
4163 2018-02-02 22:03:55 給油は給油でも、どっちのだ！！！！

4166 2018-02-02 22:03:32 god i really need to ask the naturopath if theres anything she can put me on other than fish oil

4176 2018-02-02 22:02:56 So according to @JustinTrudeau if we don't double our capacity to export crude oil we won't meet our Paris Accord Climate Agreement. That is some backwards logic. Can anyone explain this?

Subsidising 1600 per gas connection will add 8 cr rural subscribers where PNG will never reach.
4209 2018-02-02 21:57:44 Just paid 100$ for an oil change for not paying attention lmao I got GOT
4210 2018-02-02 21:57:33 OK peeps, what can I do with coconut oil?
4211 2018-02-02 21:57:31 Tea tree oil is my saviour
4212 2018-02-02 21:57:28 @KXLNews comment about Russia wanting to be a friend to the US WRONG, Russia system can not work as it should with our system in place, also the war over gas and oil comes into play, to much political BS on ground zero, coast to coast am has a new listener.
4213 2018-02-02 21:57:10 Fuck an oil catch can ima just vent to the atmosphere fuck the environment lmao
4214 2018-02-02 21:57:02 Will do. I’m on the phone trying to get some more oil from this spot on White Way. I’ve NEVER had sandalwood as dope as theirs.
4215 2018-02-02 21:56:58 Ethical oil stooge. Kenney buddy. Anti-cyclist. 'foon.
4216 2018-02-02 21:56:55 YEARS.  And oil prices of all things.
4217 2018-02-02 21:56:35 coconut oil is my best friend
4218 2018-02-02 21:56:34 I'll take a fill with regular and could you check my oil, please?
4219 2018-02-02 21:56:31 @alphabete so, I sauteed the onions in some pretty yummy olive oil with granulated garlic (my hands hurt after mincing the onions) and cumin.  Just put it into the crock pot with the beans.  Actually smells just as good as with meat, just different.
4220 2018-02-02 21:56:16 Good luck ex-evil oil baron
4221 2018-02-02 21:56:12 Gesture politics at its finest, sending a small scale worker to prison while the giant corporations growing palm oil get off. This isn't a conservation success, its just misdirected blame.
4222 2018-02-02 21:55:51 then all the africans run the oil game lmao omg
4223 2018-02-02 21:55:43 a benz oil change averaging like $315 lol...Service A lol
4224 2018-02-02 21:55:38 How come we can pipe crude oil to the North for refining but cannot pipe water there to irrigate the land and grow grasses for Fulani cows?
4225 2018-02-02 21:55:34 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
4226 2018-02-02 21:55:30 2018 Beta 300rr 2 stroke oil injected electric start. Come downfield you want to throw a leg over a 2018 Beta. Now in stock.
4227 2018-02-02 21:55:19 The USA is being Absurd. Show proof positive it even ever happened. Just as in the past there has been no Factual proof given. Assad is winning in Syria and has no reason what so ever to use Chemicals. Now the USA wanting their OIL and regime change to get it....look there
4228 2018-02-02 21:55:17 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
4229 2018-02-02 21:55:15 Capitalism kills thousands- who can’t afford food, necessary medication, etc as well as all those who die from the corners CEOs cut (ex: my lungs will never be the same bc I grew up somewhat near a large open-pit mine and a bunch of oil refineries)
4230 2018-02-02 21:55:03 John West Tuna Chunks Sunflower Oil 4pack ..John West Tuna Chunks in Brine 4 pack..John West Tuna Chunks in Spring Water 4 pack # win
4231 2018-02-02 21:55:03 We also play both sides of these regime changing wars.  Look at what we did in WW2....German Jeeps with Ford motors and the oil going back and forth, as a couple of examples.
4232 2018-02-02 21:55:01 Were in dire straits as the US just became the top producer of oil thanks to our planet killing fracking technology!  Our days are numbered!
4233 2018-02-02 21:54:56 I agree changes could be made, thank you Jenny. When we remove God then we all have our own idea of what is right and wrong (unsustainable) But there are farmers that need to report spilled milk (if old nelly kicks the milk bucket) because regulations state its an "oil spill"
4234 2018-02-02 21:54:51 The extra revenue generated by being able to sell oil at market price rather than at a discount to the USA will benefit all Canadians.
4235 2018-02-02 21:54:45 Castor oil will help 
4236 2018-02-02 21:54:43 Unfortunately there is C$25B invested in such idiocy (oil sands mining) in Alberta. The dumb thing is that BC went through the pain of transitioning from primary resources. Tech is bigger than all primary resources combined now. Surely Alberta can do it, too.
4237 2018-02-02 21:54:36 Love  argon oil 
4238 2018-02-02 21:54:35 I hate when people lie about stupid shit they told me the wait for my tire and oil change was an hour and a half bitch it’s been 2 hours and 1 minute wtf good thing I don’t have my kid with me
4239 2018-02-02 21:54:13 I love jojoba oil but I find that it doesn’t moisturise my face enough? Especially noticeable when I’m wearing makeup, skin looks very dry. Anyone else experience this??
4240 2018-02-02 21:54:07 so happy with the progress of my eyebrow growth, coconut and castor oil people!!!

4244 2018-02-02 21:53:21 Real high amps then? I've been lookin at a just makin one with a microwave transformer. High volts and amps. They give pretty deep burns. I've read the oil furnace transformers are "safer" cause it's a lower amperage. They don't burn as deep but give a nice pattern.
4245 2018-02-02 21:53:12 Line 9 was a reversal of flow project.  Literally, they changed the direction of pumping in an existing line ... oh, and licensed it to pump an additional 60K barrels of oil (240K -> 300K) Not sure where the rest of your 1.25 million # comes from.
4246 2018-02-02 21:53:05 The point is that a spill is certain, it’s not even about clean up although government and private sector both consistently faceplant on clean up regardless of budgets.  As a spill is certain, this absolutely about filling the pockets of oil investors, not Canadians. #greenjobs
4247 2018-02-02 21:52:57 “I’m bummed the fancy olive oil place closed down” is probably the townie-est thing I’ve said in some time
4248 2018-02-02 21:52:50 No contest. Especially with some mozzarella, basil and a drizzle of olive oil. Can’t do that with m&ms.
4249 2018-02-02 21:52:43 If #Requiem gets any slower it will grind to a halt. #dull #slow it’s about as gripping as a banana covered in olive oil
4250 2018-02-02 21:52:37 Wow. Your lack of self awareness demonstrated via this comment is both astounding AND horrifying. 
I read the #NunesMemo. And? 

The moral majority sees through your snake oil salesman, smoke & mirrors show.

4251 2018-02-02 21:52:36 It used to take me literally forever but now it only takes me 5 min tops. I find it easier if I add a little bit of coconut oil to the pomade on my hand 
4252 2018-02-02 21:52:32 The TrumpTax gave $11 billion in tax cuts to 4 giant oil companies in the 4th quarter of 2017.

The entire FY2017 budget of the Environmental Protection Agency is about $8 billion.
4253 2018-02-02 21:52:28 What an exhausting work day. Thank the gods for balsam fir oil and flower. Also hot water and podcasts about werewolves.
4254 2018-02-02 21:52:26 Brian, I am not anti-pipeline, but one doesn’t need to abstain from using the oil that powers society today in order to argue for change tomorrow. Your argument is really weak.
4255 2018-02-02 21:51:40 @athyvaya How did your hummus and chili work out in the end? My hummus was one of my best- loads of fresh crushed garlic and a bit of olive oil for peak smoothness.
4256 2018-02-02 21:51:27 Silverbeet/chard, rub the leaves with oil, sprinkle with salt while cooking
4257 2018-02-02 21:51:18 Ha! Do bears sell oil in the woods? We should be told.
4258 2018-02-02 21:51:14 Canes ain’t even halal, roscoes is the OG plus canes doesn’t change their oil every day
4259 2018-02-02 21:51:08 Think he'd be more inclined to buy that one oil painting of his waifu than to buy a horse tbh
4260 2018-02-02 21:51:05 a single battery will be used for decades and up to a million kilometers. how much oil would get burned for that? compared to the bits of lithium. that all ARE recyclable. it's just not comparable. at all.
4261 2018-02-02 21:51:00 the beach has oil ?
4262 2018-02-02 21:50:35 I've been waiting almost 2 hours for an oil change!!!!
Next time I'm just gonna grab some oil and change it myself
4263 2018-02-02 21:50:24 so im waiting for my oil change to get done and all the workers start singing some harmonized song and im scared
4264 2018-02-02 21:50:23 if you don’t get a semi looking at that then there’s no oil in your blood.
4265 2018-02-02 21:49:57 How did we become a net exporter of oil for only the 2nd time in history? Why did companies begin announcing
4266 2018-02-02 21:49:40 Okay, so right off I can say people have a right to look down on the recreational use of the plant. For one thing, the stuff SMELLS and that smell carries a long way. Plus the medicinal purposes of the plan have already been extracted from the oil, which to my knowledge has a-
4267 2018-02-02 21:49:35 I finally remember to check my engine oil in the parking lot at work. And not even 20 seconds and I had two men asked me if I needed help.
4268 2018-02-02 21:49:20 @kyletwebster Hey man, how's it going? Getting lag on your oil mixer brushes. Any tips on enhancing PS performance to reduce it? I've allocated more memory to PS but no joy. Cheers.
4269 2018-02-02 21:49:09 I’ve heard castor oil is good
4270 2018-02-02 21:49:02 Ruthless traders like the Chinese will be thrilled beyond words at such a vacuous, pliable creature representing their former oppressors."Aunty" may be the official snake oil for her but behind the scenes they'll be laughing their heads off.
4271 2018-02-02 21:49:00 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
4272 2018-02-02 21:48:41 I know right?! Haha I like the ink bleed line, pencil, hard airbrush and oil brush. Some of the textures are good too
4273 2018-02-02 21:48:26 Vitamin E oil is life
4274 2018-02-02 21:48:12 Drop him in a vat of boiling oil
4275 2018-02-02 21:47:44 I'm not sure that's a fair metaphor. Coal and oil companies together receive over $35billion a year in govermental subsadaries WAY MORE than renewables. If by 'mandated by the gov' you mean ppl selling power back to the utility company via solar... that's just capitalism.
4276 2018-02-02 21:47:42 Very cool. Traditionally they mix with flax oil right?
4277 2018-02-02 21:47:41 He's a 2 faced hypocrite He applies different standards depending on which end of the country he's dealing with
If he really believed in the environment and social license we'd be building Energy East and not buying ME oil
4278 2018-02-02 21:47:41 So I’m being told I need another oil change. Damn I just got one 4 months ago
4279 2018-02-02 21:47:37 เรามีความเชื่อนะ ว่าสักวันนึงเราคงได้กลับมาคุยหรือได้เล่นได้กอดกันอีก ถึงมันจะผ่านมานานแล้ว แต่เรายังมีหวัง ถึงมันริบหรี่
4280 2018-02-02 21:47:23 Thats clearly more Olive Oil Board propaganda
4281 2018-02-02 21:47:13 Mmmmh, extremely hot ... I want to be under her, even if she'll be rough, I want her oil ~
4282 2018-02-02 21:47:01 I successfully left an auto shop today without paying for anything extra than what I needed, an oil change. As a lady, I feel almost as shocked as I was when I went to see Pan’s Labyrinth thinking it would be a 1986 Labyrinth reboot.
4283 2018-02-02 21:46:55 because it has some pretty great health benefits for something a majority are lacking in.

everything else? unless your  doctor says "you're deficient in ___" it's pretty much snake oil
4284 2018-02-02 21:46:45 They want to make America dependent on oil and dirty coal.  Coal is not clean regardless of what Donald Trump chooses to spin. Renewable energy is clean energy.  Donald Trump must be stopped before he destroys the planet.  Our environment is bigger than one man. Enough is enough!
4285 2018-02-02 21:46:39 LOL, looks like Trump threw a "pity party" for himself by releasing the memos and nobody really cares, because as usual for this president,  the show biz IS all there is. No substance, no context, no proof no validity, just like Trump himself. A snake oil salsman.
4286 2018-02-02 21:46:39 that bath was magical!! 
I had my crystals with me, my salt, my lavender essential oil, my palo santo wood, and my meditation music playing. I feel great...
4287 2018-02-02 21:46:17 So, on that priciple, continuing to buy Saudi oil has turned them into a civilised country? I think it would be more effective to treat them like a North Korea, though I suspect we will have to agree to disagree.
4288 2018-02-02 21:45:53 Oil
4289 2018-02-02 21:45:46 & keep your skin moisturized with natural moisturizers, like shea butter, cocoa butter, cocoa nut oil, etc.
4290 2018-02-02 21:45:44 My favourite concealers just the maybelline fit me and it's cheap so ,,, and instead of buying a new foundation, use the one you already have and mix it with a light oil or dry oil !! It works really well
4291 2018-02-02 21:45:41 Ratio signals are SCREAMING short the hell out of oil. Maybe that perfect setup comes Monday, if not, I still love where Im at
4292 2018-02-02 21:45:38 But you will always need palm oil in your kitchen, if you handle it well you will never get stained.
4293 2018-02-02 21:45:33 Sometimes we focus so hard on what’s going wrong, that we never see the opportunity.
Focusing on the  problem and not the possibility 
Through struggle comes strength 
Through  adversity comes discovery 
Sometimes when we hit rock bottom
We’re inches away from discovering oil.
4294 2018-02-02 21:45:30 ok but i’m getting an oil change and i totally forgot my bra is in the backseat. Lmaoo bye everyone
4295 2018-02-02 21:45:29 Link: "Great! I'll grab my stuff"
Gwonam: "There is no time. Your sword is enough!"

Gwonam, you lying sack of shit. Link still had to buy lamp oil, rope, bombs, and pick up lots of other items along the way.
4296 2018-02-02 21:45:19 N my brakes n a oil change I need a man 
4297 2018-02-02 21:45:10 You put regulations on the l poor but remove them from the banks and oil companies. Another example of how Trump and his administration is against the poor and middle class.
4298 2018-02-02 21:44:59 Wish I had my own ramps. Change my oil myself. Uncle being a little b**ch about his. 
4299 2018-02-02 21:44:55 The oil is just going back to where it came from.
4300 2018-02-02 21:44:49 I was thinking the same into the close. Posted at like 2:00 that I may rotate a small portion from gold to oil. Didnt see the perfect setup, so did nothing. Like that play though
4301 2018-02-02 21:44:43 @Q_dog Quinny you glorious bastard. Old CoolShite on the Tube listener here (from the early days through to the end) just been recomended the Periodic Table of Awesome of by a friend and fuck me sideways with an oil tanker it's you guys!!! So happy that I squeed everywhere!!! 
4302 2018-02-02 21:44:40 My home girl got me some essential oils and a diffuser for Christmas aaaand I be gettin headaches here and there so I use the headache oil a couple times already....BITCH my headaches are gone. Thank u hoe @Stephcsr22
4303 2018-02-02 21:44:28 they said cause my car takes synthetic oil 
4304 2018-02-02 21:44:14 Trump and his administration don't mind hurting the poor and little guy and will impose all sorts of regulations on the poor.  But as to the rich banks and oil companies it is a whole different story. Trump must go.
4305 2018-02-02 21:44:11 can I just essential oil all the negativity out of my life?
4306 2018-02-02 21:44:08 ...and offshore Oregon and California and every other state with coastline and possible oil reserves.

4309 2018-02-02 21:43:43 Even the US the E&Ps are still off their highs overall even with oil at $65.  Problem in Canada is Keystone leak clogging storage, cause a big discount is WCS
4310 2018-02-02 21:43:39 Its the fancy beard oil my mum gave me
4311 2018-02-02 21:43:23 You lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist need to spin something New, this #Nunesburger isn't selling the lead tainted snake oil.
4312 2018-02-02 21:43:23 Never knew what real love and happiness was until I "inherited" a Poodle, not something that can be explained. Loved your documentary about Sumatra, more determined than ever to take action on unsustainable palm oil. Loved Winter Watch. Waiting for the Shrike lol! Xx

4315 2018-02-02 21:43:12 Chef Gusteau cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Silly Putty.
4316 2018-02-02 21:43:05 Hell nah mfs charged me 100 for a oil change when I first got my car and didn’t tell me the price till it was done 
4317 2018-02-02 21:43:01 With 318 million Americans NOT receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS, 2018 is off to crappy start!
Thousands of Corporate layoffs

4318 2018-02-02 21:42:59 I think the one that really made me feel uncomfortable for a bit, was the one with the girl whose Dad and brother became obsessed with cooking oil and her whole house was just a giant oil trash dump.
4319 2018-02-02 21:42:55 Man. Why do I need an oil change... On a Friday.... I just wanna go home.

4321 2018-02-02 21:42:39 Will expectation of low oil demand forestall companies from big projects? Antoine Halff @antoine_halff challenges the notion. “Some may interpret it by adding high upfront expenses now and enjoying the benefits of low variable costs in the future.” #oilandgas #CUEnergy2018
4322 2018-02-02 21:42:38 I’m sure this friend in the oil business, did something to thank trump too. Was it an all cash gift, or a %of the profit from the oil ?
4323 2018-02-02 21:42:33 Finally Spotify adds songwriter and producer credits to its. This is great news for all creators! It highlights those people that are working behind the scenes to deliver the oil in the candle of the music industry.
4324 2018-02-02 21:42:28 If we could get that, that would be awesome. Lots of oil, commodity, and gold stocks to buy!!!!!!
4325 2018-02-02 21:42:25 You have demonized the oil sands and carbon fuels. Don't be surprised when environmentalists fight them. Try reminding the public that we will be using oil for decades to come and leaving our resources on the ground benefit no-one. Just means more to import.
4326 2018-02-02 21:42:14 Whoever made hot oil hair treatments I  you
4327 2018-02-02 21:42:12 #Senegal: the first phase of development of the offshore SNE oil field will require the drilling of about 25 wells. SNE should come on stream between 2021 and 2023
4328 2018-02-02 21:42:06 I love paying $60 for an oil change 
4329 2018-02-02 21:42:02 Much fancier than mine — I usually just throw on olive oil (roast garlic infused, if I’ve got it on hand), salt, pepper, and good smoky paprika, and go for it :)
4330 2018-02-02 21:41:57 Remington gun oil with Teflon, and a soft dry cloth.
4331 2018-02-02 21:41:54 The whole siege also just felt like it kinda happened. Oh here the enemy army is, now they're gonna attack but wait now they're retreating because a couple of guys got hit by hot oil? And now Aishela is almost dead but then she's fine again because magic
4332 2018-02-02 21:41:31 It is the new oil. Was meinen Sie?
4333 2018-02-02 21:41:28 Which essential oil do you diffuse to cancel out bacon grease?
4334 2018-02-02 21:41:22 IMO Russian connections & Rosneft deal.Get Trump to lift sanctions & the oil/gas deal is back on with a financial reward to those involved.
4335 2018-02-02 21:41:21 Underactive sebum is what it fixed. I sprouted whiteheads everywhere when my guts went wacky, including getting clogged oil ducts in my eyelashes leading to dry eyes & scratchy feels when blinking. Found K2 before starting restasis & never needed it after.
4336 2018-02-02 21:41:19 My main priorities though are: 

- Trump needs to GO immediately.
- Need major public ed reform. Kids are still learning curric. from 50 years ago.
- Need to support companies like Tesla, not coal and oil.
4337 2018-02-02 21:40:54 @tonyesiki I use power oil to fry Indomie with egg then eat it with  bread #MylndomieMyStyle
4338 2018-02-02 21:40:39 Cute you think I liked Obama. And no, the deforestation for a solar farm, nah. Oil pipeline, known to leak, yeah that's a negative. Wind farm off of the coast, yes. Drilling for oil off of the coast, no. Your infrastructure, however, like your economy, was crashed by a Republican

4343 2018-02-02 21:39:56 Add some body oil and some DSL please.
4344 2018-02-02 21:39:43 I love nice people this guy is filling up my steering oil for free 
4345 2018-02-02 21:39:43 This oil just did my scalp justice
4346 2018-02-02 21:39:31 I am IN LOVE with oil pulling.

4486 2018-02-02 21:21:43 So ... my mood is better now even tho I thought my car needed a simple oil change but also needed a new radiator  so yeah that was an unexpected fee today
4487 2018-02-02 21:21:43 I *want* to get on cam today but my cam room is a complete disaster and really needs some attention. It was already getting kinda messy and then yesterday during a show I spilled melted coconut oil all over everything... #moisturized #smellsgood

4489 2018-02-02 21:21:27 We think oil wars were brutal. Wait for ground water wars.

4491 2018-02-02 21:21:12 They really believe this kind of rubbish Ben! It’s staggering! Most embarrassing and hypocritical fan base in football history! They’ve not handled the oil years well as a group
4492 2018-02-02 21:20:44 I need some beard oil
4493 2018-02-02 21:20:39 what i do is wash my face with hot & cold water then moisturise it with bio oil and cocoa butter than put sudocrem on the spots and it goes overnight sometimes takes 2 days but yeah
4494 2018-02-02 21:20:38 Wrapping up the Columbia Energy Symposium. Topics included New York State clean energy goals, electric vehicle infrastructure, blockchain, green and commercial bank project financing trends, peak oil. Future is clean
4495 2018-02-02 21:20:27 Big question: who will predominantly own electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the customer relationship in the future - big oil, auto companies, power companies, regulated utilities or independent providers? #BNEFSummit #Mobility @albertwycheung
4496 2018-02-02 21:20:10 As if confirmation was needed, Hillary Clinton is a dishonest crook. Spent too much time around slick Willy it appears. The American people should absolutely have no trust in democrats. They define sleazy snake oil salesman.
4497 2018-02-02 21:20:07 Exxon, Chevron fall short despite rising oil price:RISIN' "OIL" PRICES !! All because OUR PEOPLE FRIENDLY BILLIONAIRE PRINCE ALWALEED bin TALAL got shut down !!

4499 2018-02-02 21:19:54 BTW/unrelated: Ahead of EIA's Tues. release of AEO2017 we (@postcarbon) are releasing new report showing how their shale gas / tight oil forecasts are dangerously unfounded & overoptimistic. We'll send you a PR & are happy to brief Sen. Wyden's policy staff if interested.

4502 2018-02-02 21:19:22 Oil industry will reply, 'your evidence is shakey'

4505 2018-02-02 21:18:54 I am paying attention. Like how he said he would leave medicinal marijuana up to the states $ now is allowing the revocation the Cole Memo. Or how he said he prevent violence & there have been 3 school shootings in Jan. And how about the LGBTQ? No roads - but oil rigs in parks.
4506 2018-02-02 21:18:46 @realDonaldTrump gains will not last after even the greedy realize was selling snake oil
4507 2018-02-02 21:18:45 Everything looking good now. Want to see the dollar above 90. All out of gold puts near the day lows (humble applause). Still waiting on oil. Short average right around 65.50
4508 2018-02-02 21:18:40 It is made from oil and egg whites...I am sure the Cheese industry would have a problem with you calling mayo a "soft cheese".
4509 2018-02-02 21:18:34 TFW you threw the only licensed pilot out of the aircraft because he was a "libtard" and gave the controls to a snake oil salesman.

4512 2018-02-02 21:18:15 Who funded this study?? The oil companies and Ploughshare is behind this. He needs to disclose all his financial holdings in Iran.
4513 2018-02-02 21:18:11 DOW INDUSTRIALS gain 666 points. 
OH wait, NO 
The DOW  plunged 666 points.
@realDonaldTrump
Oil stocks fail very badly amidst the turmoil.
Looking forward to hearing the earnest explanations of the 
Dow drop as being Obama's fault.
4514 2018-02-02 21:18:11 ...They are destroying our environment for oil; for money...Cape Town, South Africa should be a huge red alert yet it is barely being mentioned in the media...That is the future we will face.

4517 2018-02-02 21:17:34 Right?  There have been oil tankers leaving a BC port for decades, and now people decide to freak out about it.
4518 2018-02-02 21:17:34 Oils are more than just a scent. They produce a physiological response with your body based on the oil(s) used. If you want, DM me and I can give you the DL on brands, types of oils, etc...
4519 2018-02-02 21:17:13 Foolish trade off oil for quakes, but I guess it is easy to make if you do not believe in science and you do believe in oil.
4520 2018-02-02 21:17:10 Thanks @GovernorSununu for guaranteeing we won’t have oil platforms off the NH coast.
4521 2018-02-02 21:17:05 Why do u have to put dependent on oil
4522 2018-02-02 21:17:00 Undercutting Gazprom (Russian oil & gas giant) in E. Europe and the symbolic strike on Assad were plenty aggressive. Leeway has to be allowed to leverage vs Russia in negotiations, which is where sanction enforcement comes in.
4523 2018-02-02 21:16:51 Big market correction coming fuelled by a weak president. Honeymoon over. US oil over produced. Serious troubled ahead
4524 2018-02-02 21:16:49 2 dam hours for an oil change I don’t want to go to El Centro for like another month 
4525 2018-02-02 21:16:46 I beleave Justin may have a different agenda where being a part of the UN is paramount in his decision making. You know - more oil to port..
4526 2018-02-02 21:16:40 I remember when one stock I was watching went from 4.20 to 6.66, and oil this summer went down to 42.00 and then roughly up to 66.60

4528 2018-02-02 21:16:17 BNEF’s @albertwycheung at the #Mobility #BNEFSummit: by 2040, EV’s will displace 8.5m barrels/day (8% global oil production) and add 1,800TWh of power demand.

4532 2018-02-02 21:15:46 someone please do something to make me get an oil change. take away my phone. revoke my weed privilege. tell me you won't be my friend anymore. anything
4533 2018-02-02 21:15:31 His hair would significantly reduce the need of foreign oil
4534 2018-02-02 21:15:16 Gargle coconut oil for 15 minutes twice a day it took my infection and pain away in 3 days
4535 2018-02-02 21:14:55 Out with the old. In with the new! This customer will see a significant difference in efficiency and savings in oil.
4536 2018-02-02 21:14:45 i sell coconut oil holla if interested

4539 2018-02-02 21:14:29 Just remembered we told one lad we called the oil and fuel patches on the floor ‘bukkake’ and made sure he filled in his school work experience book “mopping bukkake up - 30 mins”

4541 2018-02-02 21:14:12 My favorite thing about having an oil change package with the dealership is when they come and recommend me $1,000 worth of work. Uhhhh..sorry I go elsewhere for that.
4542 2018-02-02 21:14:06 I used Castrol GTX synthetic oil
4543 2018-02-02 21:13:54 And needless to say you’re a fan of a team who struck oil and have spent nearly half a billion in 18 months and you’re suddenly precious about what other clubs pay players! Give me strength
4544 2018-02-02 21:13:51 Squeaky Wheels , need some oil to fix that
4545 2018-02-02 21:13:46 I swear it seem like it take longer for an oil change in the afternoon than it do in the morning sometimes

4548 2018-02-02 21:12:56 Says a guy who was duped by the self-serving lies of a snake oil salesman & a party who reps the top 1%. Thanks but my opinion is consistent with that of major intelligence experts, not random conspiracy theorists on InfoWars & Twitter
4549 2018-02-02 21:12:54 ‘Bacon’ ?   And here I thought you were Jewish.   ;) 

Palm oil is nice though.
4550 2018-02-02 21:12:51 I don't have a question Darnell just wanted to say thank you...its been great watching you grow with the Oilers and always fun watching you play and having that big positive smile.  Looking forward to you with Oil Country for a long time

4553 2018-02-02 21:12:15 Equatorial Guinea, one of Africa's least populous countries with a population of only 1.221 million, is Africa's fourth largest producer of oil, yet 75% of its citizens live in poverty. It has been ran by President Obiang since 1979, whose son, Teodoro is his Vice President.
4554 2018-02-02 21:12:15 Pups groomed, oil changed, lots of work accomplished and only one more thing that is a must... but it's a biggie
4555 2018-02-02 21:11:52 I have been pondering over which face oil to get for a while now and this product looks great! Would love to try it out :) Nat x
4556 2018-02-02 21:11:52 Bush dropped banking regs, started 2 wars to drive up oil/gas and the military economy (Halliburton), and lost the surplus Bubba had gifted him. I'm pretty decent at history, too.
4557 2018-02-02 21:11:45 My pusher's bday party  tonight. Haahhaahaa - exactly why I had to stay another week in the oil city.
4558 2018-02-02 21:11:44 I often feel like people think this is a new thing?  As though there are no current pipelines or that trains are currently being used to transport oil. I wish there was a map and or information of what is in place now?

4562 2018-02-02 21:11:29 @JustinTrudeau  When you say "World Class Oil Clean up" can you point to anywhere in the world where it has worked? #cdnpoli #Trudeau
4563 2018-02-02 21:11:26 Get the moroccan mask for dry hair and they have a Moroccan oil for blonde/light hair. Do a mask once a week 30 min to and hour and put Moroccan oil in after you wash your hair. It’s amazing shit dude I promise you.
4564 2018-02-02 21:11:22  guys have a good weekend! We did manage to get a red candle on the weekly
4565 2018-02-02 21:11:16 It's not as dangerous as you might think. I got my husband a fryer and he pulls it out, uses it until the oil needs changed, and then puts it up for months.

Also the vegan Quorn chick'n patties are amazing deep fried.

4569 2018-02-02 21:10:52 Father, anoint me with fresh oil tonight so i will encounter breakthrough in all i lay my hands on
4570 2018-02-02 21:10:48 I heard this years ago & it’s wonderful. I barely dry off, add plant oil mix. I don’t have dry skin but this feels great all year round. Great tip as always!
4571 2018-02-02 21:10:35 And did you hear the man on the noon show talking about the so-called World Class Response to an oil spill? 15% recovery? Astonishing. I wish he'd been at the meeting to ask JT to respond to that.
4572 2018-02-02 21:10:34 She's been good to me.  Keep changing the oil, keep it away from salt, and I hope it'll drive forever

4577 2018-02-02 21:10:13 -665.75. I understand that energy stock were down today. Did the U.S. get a shipment yesterday? Possibly Russian oil.
4578 2018-02-02 21:10:01 That's the central point about #KinderMorgan: even "world class" spill response is woefully inadequate. 15% recovery (in flat water, with conventional oil) would leave 85% to decimate our coast for many years.  @bcalmanac #TrudeauTownHall

4600 2018-02-02 21:08:19 .@JustinTrudeau says #KinderMorgan pipeline is safe b/c it empties into a busy port with capacity to deal w/ oil spill challenges. Do they understand #science in #Ottawa at all? #EnglishBaySpill #bitumensinks
4601 2018-02-02 21:08:08 I’m not sure yet..I ignored oil because it was returning to trend and I believed it was glob recovery and modestly lower dollar...now that the dollar has spilled need to rethink..

4612 2018-02-02 21:05:49 The thunderous roar of disapproval will continue until the moment he stops the pipeline or loses the next election. We don't want toxic dirty oil in BC - or indeed anywhere else in the world!
4613 2018-02-02 21:05:39 Also, is it really in the strategic interest for the United States to frack every last drop of oil out of the ground for world consumption, followed by #Alaska?

4620 2018-02-02 21:05:13 That basically is his definition. His brother @EricRWeinstein talks about it often. Subsidized industries probably don't qualify as rent seeking because they actually produce something. Oil production is actually an important productive industry.

4622 2018-02-02 21:04:57 Thank you so much Alice! We we're both really inspired by the endangered species videos from YTAC (thank you again for focusing yours on palm oil - such an important issue) and really wanted to form a collective focused on conservation and emerging artists I'm so excited!
4623 2018-02-02 21:04:46 How does Oil Drilling affect tourism and fishing? Does not sound right.
4624 2018-02-02 21:04:45 Oh, well, they're all very good at their crafts and some of the most...alive people I've ever met. I hope that makes sense. They don't just exist, they live. They've all made me feel very welcome. Raevis and James are the oil painters, Greg likes water colours...

4626 2018-02-02 21:04:43 Welcome back Jesse. Hope that you are liking my town so far. I will ask u that question again in August after u have fried an egg on the hood of your car!!! Re oil, I think the smart money sees this as nothing but a dollar down trade with no fundamentals to back the rise in price

4631 2018-02-02 21:03:39 I don't think anyone lost "hope & change" aspirations more than Obama himself. I was sad to watch a man who always pressed to end oil & gas subsidies, stopped the great recession, watched all these mass shootings, get reversed now.

4655 2018-02-02 20:59:26 I don't get it either.  Then again we have politicians who "believe" the science and yet are pro-fracking.  One of President Obama's accomplishments was to streamline domestic oil permits.

4662 2018-02-02 20:57:48 Mostly great news, but didn’t see in article how @PepsiCo, which is linked to major rainforest deforestation for palm oil, is participating in these eco-friendly Super Bowl efforts. Also under party tips, simply refuse plastic utensils/bags when ordering out.

4666 2018-02-02 20:57:25 I'd assume something along the same lines will work mate. If you have vics vapour rub, boil a kettle and pour the water in to a bowl....take a spoon of the vics and stir it into the water.. then use that liquid in the same way as I described with the olbas oil mate.
4667 2018-02-02 20:57:22 I was curious and too lazy to dig around and find it so thanks. Hate how Iran gets used as a political tool by USA. USA needs to stay out of other nations' politics. That mess started back in the 50's or earlier. Inevitable bc of oil I suppose .
4668 2018-02-02 20:57:03 Yes! Get an oil cleanser.

4674 2018-02-02 20:56:13 In the words of Paul Flanagan, CEO of Nasuni (speaker in @JereDoyle's other class) "Welcome to the party, data has always been king".

4677 2018-02-02 20:55:22 2/ Tapper also failed to challenge Gaetz on the bogus outrage of the warrants being renewal. Renewal requires that the warrants have provided useful evidence in the prior 90-day period. Gaetz is peddling venomous snake oil and we need @jaketapper and others to call him on it.
4678 2018-02-02 20:55:17 For everyone that doesn’t believe in animal inteligence, my cat saved my mom’s life yesterday night.

4683 2018-02-02 20:54:22 No one wants a pipeline in their backyard but they want and continue to use the benefits of the oil industry.  everyday we’re hypocrites if we can’t recognize that we are consumers of the oil industry. Unless we’re willing to down size, have less children, stop driving?

4685 2018-02-02 20:54:16 Well I hope that's true...but I just changed the oil in my snow blower today just in case it's the other super storm
4686 2018-02-02 20:54:12 Trump’s idea of correct government control is to destroy the Arctic refuge, the western national parks, and allow drilling for oil virtually anywhere.

What is the plan for when there is an oil spill?
@JustinTrudeau "We're going to continue investing in climate change."

Not having an answer to that simple question is literally why you have crazed boo-ers who don't respect anyone else b/c whats the point in the face of that?

4702 2018-02-02 20:52:41 ...because of Rachel Notley's Climate Leadership Plan and oil sands emissions cap therein, Canada can meet its Paris obligations
4703 2018-02-02 20:52:24 Me too!  Waiting on an oil change and the guy at the counter keeps looking at me odd because I’m still giggling!
4704 2018-02-02 20:52:18 He knew from the get-go that Mexico wouldn't pay for it. Even if he puts tariffs on their goods coming into the country, we'll be the ones footing the bill in higher costs of imports. He knew. Why didn't the people who voted for him see through this scam by a snake oil salesman?

4719 2018-02-02 20:51:00 Crude oil has held up pretty well today —but it’s going lower
4720 2018-02-02 20:50:44 U.S. crude oil production exceeded 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970.
4721 2018-02-02 20:50:41 It'll be interesting to see if they do follow that pattern. Oil prices peaked well after stocks, and not months into the recesson. Will FANG stocks peak after the overall market? Certainly a reasonable bet as markets usually narrow as they lose steam.
4722 2018-02-02 20:50:40 Bruh I came to get my oil change and this dude let me pull up into the place and he said just to stay in the car while they change my oil

4729 2018-02-02 20:50:02 Donald Trump has successfully bullshitted his way thru Shady Real Estate Businesses & managed to sell enough Snake Oil to get voters to get him to the WH. The bigger story is perhaps who else has been surveilled in Congress & is it motivating their pathetic defense of the Donald.
4730 2018-02-02 20:49:55 Ok here's a life hack that'll change yiur life mate. Dont put the olbas oil on your top or a tissue or whatever....turn on your radiator and put a few drops (3 or 4) on it and the olbas oil will evaporate in to the air leaving you to breathe it all in 
4731 2018-02-02 20:49:42 I don't see it a prelude to firing Mueller. The Trump/Russia hysteria works well for Trump and Exxon Oil.

4757 2018-02-02 20:46:09 everything in my life has an oil or curry stain
4758 2018-02-02 20:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet powerful politicians.

4762 2018-02-02 20:45:35 It is said by insiders that Donald Trump smells of pickled fish, french fry grease and motor oil. Only @piersmorgan can confirm. Any word, Piers?

4764 2018-02-02 20:45:20 Just my novice charting. Either way, time is irrelevant. I have no problem waiting. Nothing can stop the elephant, the ninja, and................the Canadian (that's you @Oil_Tradr)  :)

4768 2018-02-02 20:45:00 Lunch is my favorite meal – it’s perfect for having a big huge SALAD! Raw cheese, a dab of chili-ed pinto beans, avocados, capers, turmeric, cayenne, balsamic vinegar and really good olive oil, celery and apples, turkey, ham, red lettuce, romaine, carrots, broccoli…#killgout!
4769 2018-02-02 20:44:53 Yep, there are plenty of alternatives, but I just use what works for me. Some people seem to swear by orange oil (which that air freshener uses) and even just plain cooking spray (which shares some base oils used in Goo Gone)

4771 2018-02-02 20:44:32 His “logic” contradicts his other actions (he opposes Big Oil but doesn’t want to cut down on personal auto use?) and data (the working poor need transit because they don’t drive, despite the mayor claiming otherwise). He expects people to blindly follow him. So arrogant.
4772 2018-02-02 20:44:29 We are proud to announce Petro will be a sovereign crypto asset backed by oil assets and issued by the Venezuelan State as a spearhead for the development of an independent, transparent and open digital economy open to direct participation of citizens.
4773 2018-02-02 20:44:19 How can't we get off the oil. There has to be a way through this.
4774 2018-02-02 20:44:17 The obvious concern, obviously, is that as an oil exploration specialist he may have been appointed to redirect the @USGS into fossil fuel exploitation.
4775 2018-02-02 20:44:13 Pepsico should show how they use inhumane destructive ways to get palm oil. They are killing endangered species and using child labor. Do  it support companies that use bad ways of getting ingredients 4 their products. @AndyFales @Murph_Andy

4784 2018-02-02 20:43:10 When we drained the oil. it looked like metallic paint there was so much metal shavings in it.
4785 2018-02-02 20:43:05 The right "order of operations" for people who are actually rationally prioritizing the climate crisis is 1. eliminate coal, 2. eliminate oil, 3. eliminate gas, 4. seek to review standards for nuclear operators, 5. upgrade to advanced nuclear and turn old waste into fuel.
4786 2018-02-02 20:42:59 This whole gavotte is a distraction from the unraveling of government protections.  The judicial system is being stacked by Koch puppets, the oil corporations can now plunder willy nilly..smog & mirrors

4790 2018-02-02 20:42:24 Are you folks saying it's a bad thing that KinderMorgan owns an oil spill cleanup company?? If anything it demonstrates K-M probly wld be a responsible operator of an expanded @TransMtn pipeline. I'm not a big fan of K-M's behaviour but the merits of its expansion shld be obvious
4791 2018-02-02 20:42:12 Why do you think they Offer Cashbacks?!! Todays companies are driven by data. Data = Oil. It is important how people are aware & deny too much of Private Info. Like, Adhaar Seeding, Payback points, e-shopping (customized ads), location tracking, etc.
4792 2018-02-02 20:41:57 That’s lit. Somebody fine with a beard come teach me to change oil.
4793 2018-02-02 20:41:51 Even oil prices dropped. Thanks  for nothing, Donnie.
4794 2018-02-02 20:41:48 YES!  We finally are rid of Christy, so we don't need Dump letting big oil drill off our coast!
4795 2018-02-02 20:41:28 Water can never mix with oil
4796 2018-02-02 20:41:19 Train guard just smirked at the picture on my railcard. He’s no oil painting either.
4797 2018-02-02 20:41:02 Ultimately, the behavior of the PM and the vitriol being stirred up in Alberta threatens Confederation. Yes we love being Canadian, but we love our environment more. People also lose sight of the fact that none of this dirty oil is for domestic consumption.
4798 2018-02-02 20:40:59 Oil change!! Thats my bitch
4799 2018-02-02 20:40:57 And btw all these children screaming aew using products everyday made from oil, they can all bite me, they are also first ones to cry the blues over lack of social programs, where do they think the money comes from
4800 2018-02-02 20:40:57 Smells like pickled fish and motor oil
4801 2018-02-02 20:40:57 The tax cut just for OIL companies in ONE quarter alone is already bigger than the total amount of money corporations are giving out in one-time worker bonuses.

4805 2018-02-02 20:40:44 PMJT is showing his true colors
Not only is he a liar with multiple broken promises, but his "social license" license catchphrase was the big lie 2 fool those opposed 2 tar sands expansion &more pipelines
@liberal_party Canada always has been & always will be in big oil's pocket
4806 2018-02-02 20:40:34 Lies to make urself seem important. Collusion, treason, obstruction, destruction of EPA regs that threaten  air, land & water, selling off nat'l park land 2 foreign oil & DIRTY coal interests. BTW, no such thing as "clean coal". Just another lie. DOW down 1,000+ pts in 3 days.

4809 2018-02-02 20:40:18 Hadn’t oil prices plummeted through the floor over the last few years while our economy has not ?  Difficult to say oil drives Canada’s economy.  I think you mean Alberta’s.

4813 2018-02-02 20:39:44 yes you are right. Cashews, viscose, avocados and palm oil can be damaging. However I live in wales and the local environment is wrecked by sheep. Eating a plant based diet would give wales back its wilderness.
4814 2018-02-02 20:39:40 Oh now if 007, Daniel Craig as Bond I'm prepared to distract him & hell I'll dip myself in Vat of oil.. a la Goldfinger.. oh right...not that kind of agent...*sighs*

4817 2018-02-02 20:38:41 Let's hope that drilling for oil or oil tanker spills don't wipe this important creature off the planet. Like to see these genomes rebuild Washington. :)
4818 2018-02-02 20:38:35 Rub myself down with coconut oil... I used too much... I'm oily now... it's cool I smell good 
4819 2018-02-02 20:38:26 Not enough people have the chance to visit the oil patch and BC coast, we need to foster a greater understanding between these two worlds
4820 2018-02-02 20:38:24 Emu oil saved my life, I was being cheap and nearly ruined my skin, but thank God.....never again .
4821 2018-02-02 20:38:10 Oof. That's rough. I worked in the environmental side of the oil and gas industry. Saw so many people get laid off and decided that volatility was not good for me.
4822 2018-02-02 20:37:48 Here's an idea, why won't her millionaire's ass and her millionaire buddies just tap on non oil energy sources and make it happen in a sustainable way instead, if anyone is capable of that, be a part of the solution, bitch
4823 2018-02-02 20:37:42 That's cool that they use environmentally friendly palm oil! How can you know what other companies make sure their palm oil is responsibly made?
4824 2018-02-02 20:37:41 Sending you good vibes
4825 2018-02-02 20:37:37 Very nice.  Little mineral oil will rehydrate that wood nicely!

4827 2018-02-02 20:37:23 Okay quit all this B.S. about standing up for oil piplines, sweating because Kenny is going to kick your butt in next election, You and Horgan can cry when you both loose
4828 2018-02-02 20:37:20 Did you use mobile 1 synthetic oil?
4829 2018-02-02 20:37:19 GORGEOUS Corvette! Wish I owned it! Man, it's too BEAUTIFUL, too precious to be used for racing. I'd use it as a daily driver, & change the oil & filters on a regular basis, & treat it w/tender loving care!
4830 2018-02-02 20:37:16 Crude oil only down 43 cents, yet massive selling in the stocks. What gives?

4835 2018-02-02 20:36:43 The guy changing my oil said he would replace my windshield wipers for free if I added him on Snapchat. I'd say it was a fair trade

4841 2018-02-02 20:36:01 The red ink is disappearing as oil $ is . IMO, the US signed NAFTA back in the day to realize a cheap &  steady oil supply. Keeping it 'landlocked' ensures the same, without any trade concessions. Notley's $ avg. 20% below Global $, tidal water represents a price increase.
4842 2018-02-02 20:35:51 I’m having a good hair day today! Tea tree oil is lifeeee
4843 2018-02-02 20:35:47 In the world but he wanted to trade oil w the petro dollar & his gold standard was top ... in October 2016 obama pardoned the Libyan arms dealer (I can send u some really interesting articles) we sold dead qadaffi weapons into turkey that went into Syria ...
4844 2018-02-02 20:35:35 Scott Pruitt built a $25 k office for himself, is against most RPA efforts but did he not just rule against Zinke’s attempt to drill for oil in the pristine Alaskan Bay.
4845 2018-02-02 20:35:32 Nice. Now clean up the oil spill in British Columbia.
4846 2018-02-02 20:35:18 FAA approves first drones for oil & gas platforms and flame ports.
4847 2018-02-02 20:35:14 Need to #KeepitWild, not open these public lands to motorized recreation, or any type of mining, drilling for oil, etc that would ruin the beauty of these areas #publiclands
4848 2018-02-02 20:35:05 Coconut oil is my bestfriend
4849 2018-02-02 20:35:04 Gas and oil prices are up, inflation is up. Food costs more. Interest rates are rising. So what do we get? CRUMBS
4850 2018-02-02 20:35:02 USA: World leader in oil production and gun deaths.

4851 2018-02-02 20:35:01 My go-to’s: Islands in the Stream by Dolly Parton/Kenny Rogers; Chateau Lobby #4 by Father John Misty; Carey by Joni Mitchell; Fool For Love by Lord Huron; Simple As This by Jake Bugg. Janis Ian’s Between the Lines album is sad(dish) but fun to sing dramatically in a bathrobe.
4852 2018-02-02 20:34:56 I have never seen coconut oil proscribed, I have never heard of it being proscribed as it is not a moisturiser that would be used for people with skin problems. I can't see the full article, but if there is a name for it I can explain why
4853 2018-02-02 20:34:55 If you are still interested in the Palm Oil/ Red Oil Business, now is the right time to hit me up! Season is here!!!

4855 2018-02-02 20:34:45 Unfortunately for me that was a few months before oil prices bottomed out and the industry went into massive down cycle
4856 2018-02-02 20:34:25 Sometimes when I'm bored, I like to wrap myself in a sleeping bag, cover myself in vegetable oil and pretend to be a slug!
4857 2018-02-02 20:34:22 @gillinghamjoe you’re not giving the oil fired radiator community the credit they deserve.
4858 2018-02-02 20:34:17 Kalu Ogechi received N50800 from Elvis Okebalama being payment for Palm Oil
4859 2018-02-02 20:34:10 Don't think it's that simple, the period leading up to Iranian rev 1979 has been cited as one of greatest hikes of wages in history (due to oil prices mainly), & fortunately the masses used that economic power to oust the Shah... I agree tho that dispossessed need to fight4rights
4860 2018-02-02 20:33:26 Friday's are tough days to short oil, as the unknown weekend event is always outt here.
4861 2018-02-02 20:33:19 Ah yeah they aren’t always perfect. I know someone who takes like four at a time for it to work. You can always try lavender essential oil (rubbed on your feet and/or diffused).
4862 2018-02-02 20:33:16 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
4863 2018-02-02 20:33:03 I think I jacked my hand. I went to bowl and hit an oil patch and my feet went from underneath me and down I went.
4864 2018-02-02 20:33:02 Money managers have cut their bullish Nymex WTI crude oil bets by 136 net-long positions to 495,975, weekly CFTC data on futures and options show. - BBG #OOTT
4865 2018-02-02 20:32:45 Good thing oil is still cheap enough to make most off shore drilling prohibitively expensive.
4866 2018-02-02 20:32:37 China has an 5 year plan on electric vehicles and executes it. Despite US tight oil production, the reserves are still small compared to heavyweights in conventional oil production. Producing unconventional oil means the cheap stuff is gone: the marginal wells become more costly.
4867 2018-02-02 20:32:35 Damn, today is one week since the beginning of the Oil Down controversy. Oh how time flies.

4870 2018-02-02 20:32:28 It's an easy solution the federal government needs to ban the use of all oil and gas products in B.C That will get their attention

4877 2018-02-02 20:31:24 Is it common for well-to-do British Columbians to take their motorized pleasure crafts out on the water to protest oil pipelines and oil tankers?

4881 2018-02-02 20:30:53 LOL! Funny you say that! I was just thinking about dips to go with the new @SieteFoods foods chips I bought. No corn - just cassava flour, avocado oil, coconut flour, ground chia seed, sea salt. Do you have a dip or topping suggestion?

4884 2018-02-02 20:30:39 Yes!! When you over-wash, your face gets irritated and compensates by making more oil, then you get clogged pores. 
4885 2018-02-02 20:30:37 i'm sad to say that I go to this gym too and no one has yet doused me in oil!!!!!
4886 2018-02-02 20:30:34 ...THEN you had to put a crush ring between the opening cover and the block and somehow hold it in place while you tightened the cover. And if you didn't put the filter in right, it just wouldn't work, and the engine wouldn't get oil. If you screwed up the crush ring...
4887 2018-02-02 20:30:34 Roger Ailes and Murdoch have been very successful at getting America's biased nonthinkers to embrace fascism and discredit credible news outlets. Sad state of affairs when an absolute snake oil salesman can become POTUS..

4895 2018-02-02 20:30:02 PMJT's "absolute cap" on oilsands GHGs, at 100MMTCo2e/yr, is 50% ABOVE their 2015 actual levels. He has allocated 18% of Canada's nation-wide 2030 GHG budget to oilsands producers. Which Candians must curtail their consumption of made-in-Canada energy to subsidize oil exports?..2

4898 2018-02-02 20:29:44 BHI rig count up nicely this week. Could see the next move higher in RIG count with oil production ticking over 10M - $AVE.V
4899 2018-02-02 20:29:40 Love what I head on Steve Harvey today. Just because a female knows how change oil knows how to use power tools and lift heavy object does not mean she has to. at the end of the day because she knows how does not mean the man let her do it. Because she can doesn’t mean she has to
4900 2018-02-02 20:29:34 When we talk about shade, that speaks to your skin tone, hence you see same bottle with different 'colors'. Re skin type, speaks to getting a formula that best suits your skin. So if you have dry skin, you'd need makeup that provides oil to it. Reverse same
4901 2018-02-02 20:29:25 My flatmate helped me make a new beard oil. It smells nice 
4902 2018-02-02 20:29:02 compare the crude oil price in the international maket in the year 2012 and the crude oil price now just dnt manipulate..andh bhakt ke liye sahi hai

4907 2018-02-02 20:28:29 Can't believe how productive I was between 6am-9am. (Oil change, car wash, hair cut, grocery shopping) and then achieved nothing with my life after that. #DayOffWoes
4908 2018-02-02 20:28:17 451 degrees Fahrenheit - enough for oil painting?
4909 2018-02-02 20:28:07 Oh, you should have seen what you had to do to replace the oil filter on my early 80s BMW bike. First, you had to (not kidding here) remove an exhaust pipe, because the filter opening was behind it. Take out the filter. Get the new filter and put an o-ring on it. THEN...
4910 2018-02-02 20:27:59 Lol @ confirmation. You're 14, get oil all over your forehead when your forehead is already at its oiliest, then you're asked to reject Satan right before high school starts and you need him the most

4919 2018-02-02 20:26:59 Today, @northerncenter @alaskawild @defenders @sierraclub @wilderness filed a lawsuit in Fed Dist court against the Dept of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Mgmt challenging a 2017 decision to issue oil and gas leases in the Ntl Petroleum Res-AK, aka the Western Arctic.
4920 2018-02-02 20:26:52 Depends if youve had a hard day at work.. warm oil, hot stones, my strong hands massaging your gorgeous body..
4921 2018-02-02 20:26:33 The oil issue is a case of Trump answering to multiple masters. The US fossil fuel lobby helped him much more explicitly  so he answers to them first. Trump responds readily to cash flow in his direction.
4922 2018-02-02 20:26:15 Materialism could be an explanation as to why for example the CPA privatised the Iraqi oil sector, instead of leaving that decision to a democratically elected Iraqi government.
4923 2018-02-02 20:26:07 I hope you feel better soon, oregano oil caps work wonderful
4924 2018-02-02 20:25:59 Just learned you can make tortilla chips by cooking tortillas in oil on the stove. I know I should of realized this earlier but wow my life is changed
4925 2018-02-02 20:25:53 Sorry I was beating off to some conspiracy porn and had to buy some infr0warez brain force to fill the coffers of lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist @RealAlexJones
4926 2018-02-02 20:25:49 An oil change on my 7-series involves removing the drain plug with a Torx bit, removing the filter cover with a large wrench, replacing the o-rings on the plug and filter cover, replacing the filter, and reassembling the whole mess. It's way more fiddly than necessary.
4927 2018-02-02 20:25:37 Wouldn't it break great if after indy Scotland shut down all oil fields, could you imagine the tory faces lol
4928 2018-02-02 20:25:28 I sooooooooo wanna try this night oil

4932 2018-02-02 20:24:34 Oh yes, I forgot about your in depth knowledge of sinus issues! olbas oil is indeed a thing of wonder.
4933 2018-02-02 20:24:17 Very frustrating day for oil shorts...
4934 2018-02-02 20:24:16 So apparently the #Kalamazoo County Parks Commission and Patricia Crowley (the Drain Commissioner) has approved oil drilling in Scotts Mill County Park. I still don't know a lot of details, so I'll keep my opinion out of this at this point.
4935 2018-02-02 20:24:07 getting an oil change & a new tire
4936 2018-02-02 20:23:49 There is no length they won't go, to sell the American,people there snake oil. #ReleaseTheMemo #LOCKHERUP
4937 2018-02-02 20:23:45 Never forget Obama and dems saying "we can't drill our way out of oil crisis"  and laughing at anyone thinking we could.  Way to go private indusrty!
4938 2018-02-02 20:23:35 Hey @doctorow ! Check out @Kopser4Congress - he raised so much that #Trump and oil industry lapdog Lamar Smith decided to retire. House science committee will be much better off now.

4940 2018-02-02 20:23:18 Does she realize oil tankers are already there?
4941 2018-02-02 20:23:18 And its like the owners of the land are not getting enough of the oil money anymore and now want back their land.
4942 2018-02-02 20:23:17 Hey!  Oklahoma didn't want #PunkassPruitt anymore as he was a Liability.  Pruitt is a Big Oil representative--Perfect for trump who removed Limits on Big Oil's FRACKING.  Oklahoma  has daily/frequent Earthquakes from this dangerous practice.  Fuck trump AND Pruitt!  #TrumpRussia
4943 2018-02-02 20:22:53 @JustinTrudeau we don’t want the pipeline in BC. Alberta’s oil is not our problem. #protectthecoast #Pipelines #kindermorgan
4944 2018-02-02 20:22:51 Oddly we had electric in the house, gas for the old oven (from gas bottles) and oil for the heating. It’s nice to be one fuel source down!
4945 2018-02-02 20:22:48 Snag some investment from one of those oil millionaires into $amlh :)
4946 2018-02-02 20:22:46 Not sure. Possible oil spill as a lot of sand on the road. Mobile home van was parked up too
4947 2018-02-02 20:22:40 Where can I get an oil change for the low?
4948 2018-02-02 20:22:33 Rear brakes, oil change, and a new filter installed in my car... feels good
4949 2018-02-02 20:22:32 Oil change in the Kia requires taking like 17 bolts out holding a cover on

4955 2018-02-02 20:21:38 Oil in Santa Monica, no, 9 million+ tourists in our city of 94,000 residents, that's okay.
4956 2018-02-02 20:21:28 He looked to the side and then kissed her “You are right but I’m still mad at you so shh” he took off her top getting some warm oil to give her a back rub. “Look Diva couldn’t bare to lose you okay, I know you won’t risk your life for nothing but if would destroy her if you died+
4957 2018-02-02 20:21:23 It's all crumbling down like a house of cards.  And people that voted for Trump either didn't do their due diligence, or were fooled by a snake oil salesman.  Pathetic.
4958 2018-02-02 20:21:16 See - we don't need solar or wind...... (the Koch brothers....) wait until we start off-shore drilling!  We'll have OIL EVERYWHERE!  YEAH!

4961 2018-02-02 20:20:31 He has been flexing his autocratic muscles on behalf of Alberta's Oil Industry and dirty tar sands oil and brushing aside land & ocean risks as minor. People, including moi, are pretty chuffed at him and the whole neolib establishment.

4965 2018-02-02 20:20:06 That's good. I don't really have that luxury. I could change my own oil, and a few other things, but I can't really handle anything much more complex than "unscrew this and screw it to this".

I destroyed the engine on my old BMW bike trying to replace the pushrod seals.

4967 2018-02-02 20:19:45 Why don't Iceland (fishing?), Norway (oil?) and Liechtenstein (banking/haven?) want full EU membership (and all rules). Do they have a USP to help them stand apart? If so, what is UK's equivalent USP?
4968 2018-02-02 20:19:44 It could be worse. You could have heating oil so you never know when they'll show up, fill the tank, and drop a $200-500 bill in your mailbox.
4969 2018-02-02 20:19:33 Yep - You’ve already decided that you want it! TBH that’s quite a lot of fun for ~£10k and if it’s in Aberdeen it’s probably been owned by an engineer in the oil industry that has looked after it.

4975 2018-02-02 20:19:02 Had a 3.9 Classic 5 door, off roaded the hell out of it, and used it on the road, used no oil or water, the p38 4.0 used lots of water, head gasket was fine, just used loads. My 2.5 bmw engine p38 diesel one was great, probably as quick as the 4.0 to

5005 2018-02-02 20:15:06 It really wasn't. Yes this document implies the Peepee Papers (trademark) were the only reason. But doesn't actually say that, because it wasn't. His business was in Russian oil and he admitted to giving documents to a Russian agent.

5020 2018-02-02 20:12:47 I can appreciate that, but if the car is over my head, probably so is the maintenance.

I used to ride BMW motorcycles. The maintenance nearly killed me. Now I ride a Kawasaki. I get the oil changed, new tires, maybe a valve adjustment every third year, and I'm good.
5021 2018-02-02 20:12:46 Venezuela was afflicted by over reliance on oil plus corruption. Nothing to do with socialism. Bernie wasn't advocating true socialism, merely more capital controls and state intervention. Ya know like all those successful, wealthy, happy, equal European countries

The coverage/oil control seems promising, which is why I want it. but the texture showed up on me and that kinda made me hold off from buying for now. I still might buy tho. I prob need a better primer
5038 2018-02-02 20:09:12 Who is that ex oil guy who now writes for the Globe? ( if that's what he actually said)
5039 2018-02-02 20:09:09 Oh easy  . I’ve got all the oils except rosemary oil and tea tree oil. I will substitute coconut oil with something  because it dries my hair  . Aw thank you girl 
5040 2018-02-02 20:09:08 i don’t know why coconut oil works so well for my face, i don’t have genetically good skin i have eczema and cystic acne but when i put coconut oil on my face before bed i swear my face looks so good when i wake up
5041 2018-02-02 20:09:00 Hopefully, that coconut one won’t give me the oil.
5042 2018-02-02 20:08:39 @RegalMovies turned my boyfriend away from a movie because he had a glass bottle with him. It was olive oil in a gift bag, a gift for a friend he's seeing later. #ummwhat

5044 2018-02-02 20:08:20 I get my oil changed at the Chevy dealership every 6 months. Last year this time they said I had a leak & it would be $2,000 to fix. I park my car in the garage & never seen a leak on the garage floor. I say no don’t fix it. 6 months ago I come in and they say my car is perfect..

5074 2018-02-02 20:05:26 Well, we get most of our oil from Mexico and Venezuela, so that's more Europe's problem anyway.  Not that Mexico and Venezuela are having their best days lately
5075 2018-02-02 20:05:19 I think there are several issues here at play, the nunes dud, the 3 lawyers removing themselves from Gates, oil, and a course correction of an over inflated market on Trump's win. They are realizing it may end up being a negative not a positive.

5084 2018-02-02 20:04:07 Private capital. None of our biz. Canadian oil is trading at a $30 discount. The pipeline exists today, just want to increase capacity. Do that and discount at least partially goes away. It’s a no brainer.

It is 100% for export.
Get your facts straight!

5097 2018-02-02 20:02:32 Generally agree, but curious as to how you see oil fitting in? Up 50% is true, but that's off of multi year lows and all we really did was return to long term average price ranges btwn mid 50 to mid 60.
5098 2018-02-02 20:02:22 By the way thanks for the advice on oil pulling I think I'm going to have to find a way to bring that up.

5144 2018-02-02 19:57:40 FYI the Federal subsidies for oil, gas and coal are PERMANENT subsidies. Renewable subsidies are temporary. Current ones expire in 2021, by which time electricity from wind and solar with storage will be cheaper than subsidized coal.
5145 2018-02-02 19:57:33 If to light Petersburg w/ electricity it's necessary that the smallest number of lives should perish, then let Petersburg be lighted by oil.

5159 2018-02-02 19:55:18 @SamHammer (4/4) understand the molecular properties of the oil used in this experiment. The shape that the oil took on is also curious as it didn’t remain connected but rather separated into multiple different circular shapes with water separating each. This leads me to believe

5161 2018-02-02 19:55:01 @SamHammer (3/4) characteristics must differ from water despite both being liquids. The oil’s solvent properties were not compatible with water and this created a lot of surface tension between the two liquids. To better understand what happened in my experiment, I must better

5170 2018-02-02 19:54:13 @SamHammer (1/4) When the oil made contact with the water, the oil did not mix into the water. This means that the oil was not soluble in water.

5172 2018-02-02 19:54:00 @mcten bruh do you need some Beard Oil? @DollarShaveClub can hook that up
5173 2018-02-02 19:53:42 @bcalmanac What I don't understand is how Suncor can announce buying automated trucks to cut 400 jobs, but BC is demonized for wanting better oil spill response. The system is backwards and broken.
5174 2018-02-02 19:53:41 Mi humilde opinion es un poco politico otro esque apareció el tren de nuevo y subio el gas oil
5175 2018-02-02 19:53:34 BMW had just called and that little oil smell is going to cost me $1800 today. 
5176 2018-02-02 19:53:27 But there are plenty of driving jobs avaiable outside the oil sands. Yes a family life change but thats the direction the world is going.
5177 2018-02-02 19:53:07 You love justice and hate evil.
    Therefore God, your God, has anointed you,
    pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.

Psalm 45:7
5178 2018-02-02 19:53:06 Oh wait til he gets the baby oil tomorrow!
5179 2018-02-02 19:53:00 He checked your oil Private Dancerrrr
5180 2018-02-02 19:52:50 Sweetie, what are you even talking about.  The economy, the S&P and the DOW are on the same trend as the last 8 years.  ISIS has been losing ground for years.  We're actually importing MORE oil under trump, not less.  So, no, "nothing" cause it didn't happen.  Read a book.
5181 2018-02-02 19:52:49 I could oil my hair using a Pizza Hut box fam
5182 2018-02-02 19:52:35 Keep the boyfriend I just want the things that come with one..free money , oil changes , car washes , surprise lunch , you know Lil stuff
5183 2018-02-02 19:52:08 Lets say we block all imports. (except maybe some raw materials we need - assuming that our trade behavior doesn't affect those). You think they'll hire people at $40 and hour to turn a wrench? Or buy robots to do it for oil?
5184 2018-02-02 19:52:04 And of course moisturizer is important, ESPECIALLY if you have oily skin. A lot of times oily skin is also dehydrated( it lacks moisture) so the skin produces even more oil to compensate for the lack of moisture
5185 2018-02-02 19:51:48 Decided to have a nice Epsom salt bath with some essential oils after my workout today due to being sore. Added a little too much peppermint oil and now my legs are the embodiment of how it feels to chew 5 gum
5186 2018-02-02 19:51:42 Golddown. Oil down. ES down. BTC down. Jiggy is right. Not even sure if weekend BTC bid mode is coming or not.
5187 2018-02-02 19:51:37 The country is emerging from a destructive civil war, the reconstruction of the country with the oil money explains that number. It is like Europe after WW2 and the Marshall plan.
5188 2018-02-02 19:51:16 I feel like I’m the only person who is not into the essential oil craze. I don’t keep them in my pockets or purses. I really only use them for soap making.
5189 2018-02-02 19:51:16 Another rural #biketourism need we've seen is general stores wanting access to bike distributors like @QualityBike.  Just as many carry motor oil and aren't a "car shop", many want to carry tubes and tires without being a "bike shop". #cycling #tourism #travel #outsidethebox
5190 2018-02-02 19:51:12 Put a snake plant in your bedroom. At night it releases oxygen which helps you sleep. Put some organic lavender oil on a cotton round and put it in your pillow case while you sleep. Do stretches before bed and it will relax your leg muscles. Just a few examples!
5191 2018-02-02 19:51:07 Don’t need nuclear when you already have nukes  and plan to increase oil energy
5192 2018-02-02 19:51:04 What's his plan for "stability" in America? He & Dear Genius screwed the pooch on that. Is our democracy what the KochBros & Oil & Gas oligarchs are selling to do business with international thief & embezzler Putin? How much is the Syrian dictator getting in that deal?
5193 2018-02-02 19:51:00 #NowPlaying Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning
5194 2018-02-02 19:50:59 I Vaped me some and was good at two puffs. Oil is good to vape. I will post some pictures of what I bought. They all are real. I have Occasionally Tremors. That's why I smoke and vape now. 
5195 2018-02-02 19:50:49 Cuzz Cuzz said “To the oil ..”
5196 2018-02-02 19:50:42 basically a fool.. he thinks he can stop the investigation on him this way..
5197 2018-02-02 19:50:23 "I know," he began rubbing in the oil, his thumb pressing in circles on his neck. "Happy birthday."
5198 2018-02-02 19:50:19 CNN has gone so far beyond even comedy in their reporting. At first it was funny to watch them lie, distort, and squirm.  Now their desperation brings the lies to a whole new level. They should be taken off air.  Not news. Public menace channel.  Fake news x100. @cnn @foxnews
5199 2018-02-02 19:50:17 But I prefer olive oil.
5200 2018-02-02 19:50:15 The stitches are starting to feel irriating and I'm stuck with them 'til Tuesday afternoon. I'll try a shower later, apply coconut oil and antibiotic with a new band aid so the site stays sterile and protected.
5201 2018-02-02 19:50:14 Where can one buy a castor oil for hair growth? #GirlTalkZA #AskingForAFriend
5202 2018-02-02 19:50:12 Ok, so fair enough. Property taxes, not the same as income tax.

Bad example. I will own that.

What is 100% accurate, is that Alaskan's own that oil, so therefore any tax revenues generated from said oil sales, belongs to ALL Alaskans.
5203 2018-02-02 19:50:08 Several years ago, the Bureau of Land Management planning office  prepared a document called a “Reasonably Foreseeable Development  Scenario for Oil and Gas” in the Monticello, Utah area ‘The  Monument Upwarp.’ development potential f is  considered moderate to low.”
5204 2018-02-02 19:50:08 no podría haber mercados sin políticas económicas? Pienso que los mercados pueden darse sin políticas.
5205 2018-02-02 19:50:06 while his administration puts tariffs on solar and allows oil drilling in protected areas
5206 2018-02-02 19:50:02 The PM is showing polical courage by standing up for the pipeline. He has always said that in order for the climate action plan to be accepted by all provinces we need to also get our product to tidewater. No pipeline, no buy in from oil producing provinces
5207 2018-02-02 19:49:49 I use the new car - old oil analogy, usually works. 
If industry isn't bothered about enforcing and client is happy to fuck up the new boiler & invalidate warranty, so be it. 
Their penny pinching will cost them more in the long run. I like to avoid those type of customer.
5208 2018-02-02 19:49:48 All that pressure but it can't defeat you
5209 2018-02-02 19:49:47 all day i just have to get an oil change sometime in the morning.
5210 2018-02-02 19:49:40 Haha. Why  now? Things haven’t change any? Never sell Teump short! Have they got oil?
5211 2018-02-02 19:49:40 PREPARE THE BOILING OIL
5212 2018-02-02 19:49:40 Why do you think the oil change is just $25?
5213 2018-02-02 19:49:31 Getting an oil change  was well needed ..
5214 2018-02-02 19:49:31 Hey Alaska friends - looking for recommendations for a nonpartisan oil and gas analyst who can speak to how new leasing opps in the Arctic may  (or may not) impact the state's economy
5215 2018-02-02 19:49:09 Brent is at 68 a barrel, down
WTI at 65 a barrel down.
Energy going down bc Putin trying to creep into American gas/oil market.

5216 2018-02-02 19:49:00 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
5217 2018-02-02 19:48:54 Thanks..I will correct it later.
5218 2018-02-02 19:48:51 Using shampoo, oil or lemon is a waste 
5219 2018-02-02 19:48:31 That's the one. Howe doubled unemployment to 3 million plus, and ensured the North Sea oil bonanza was squandered or squirrelled away by his pals in the City.
5220 2018-02-02 19:48:27 #BRENT oil its all very well gloating  about how high a barrel of crude is   -: its the poor consumer that is paying the price at the pump 
5221 2018-02-02 19:48:26 Lmao. I'm getting a new bottle of coconut oil
5222 2018-02-02 19:48:23 Did not appreciate the fast-talking guys at @THEsuperlube trying to take me for a $100+ ride when all I needed was a basic oil change.
5223 2018-02-02 19:48:23 "No oil/ gas here/ let's leave this one to admire"
5224 2018-02-02 19:48:19 Straws are the biggest polluter out of all synthetics produced from oil.
5225 2018-02-02 19:48:12 I love facial oil, it has helped turn around my terribly dry skin.  It's a little miracle worker 
5226 2018-02-02 19:48:11 Hey Brittany, totaly love ur videos! Where do you get your tea tree oil? I see it in ur videos in ur cleaning solutions and also in ur diffuser. Seems very handy with so many uses.
5227 2018-02-02 19:48:03 I'm getting my oil changed so i actually had to eat lunch in the break room & it was fuckin WEIRD
5228 2018-02-02 19:47:35 Just think! This is all about Russia selling oil, and trump building a hotel in Moscow... fn’ money! #ImpeachTrump #MemoDay
5229 2018-02-02 19:47:12 Almond oil b!! Aloe Vera and tea tee oil (dilute it!) is good for scalps ~ also switch to organic shampoos and conditioners.
5230 2018-02-02 19:47:11 Oil change update the service guy forgot to tell the Service manager I was here really WTF?
5231 2018-02-02 19:47:09 Guess I’ll just stick to the coconut oil 
5232 2018-02-02 19:46:54 -yea doof. Have u Ever asked yourself ‘why would Russia want Trump’?Russia’s economy is a 1trick pony: exporting Oil &gas.
5233 2018-02-02 19:46:52 @jblags the dollar is high value demand&naija was easy source of $ fx auction&oil subsidy payment to stash $ & not a dime payed in taxes
5234 2018-02-02 19:46:43 They bought the snake oil, now they're surprised it has no actual value? Color me shocked.
5235 2018-02-02 19:46:24 Omg j'ai une photo de moi avant et mes cheveux ptn i just wanna thank God for argan oil
5236 2018-02-02 19:46:20 Cause my car was fine. I had an inspection the day before I left. When I came back and went in for the oil change all these problems occurred.
5237 2018-02-02 19:46:15 My point is that subsidies exist for a lot of things. In some cases there's a clear public interest in doing so (like health care research, and IMO clean energy) and some cases not (IMO oil). Why laud "beautiful clean coal" but not "beautiful clean energy?"
5238 2018-02-02 19:46:13 FOLLOWING THE OIL SPILL THERE WILL BE AN OIL  SPILL LIABILITY TRUST TO BE ESTABLISHED WHICH PROVIDES $1 BILLION PER SPILL TO HELP WITH THE CLEAN-UP
5239 2018-02-02 19:45:48 Once made, I drown mine in my favourite olive oil.  That looks delicious!
5240 2018-02-02 19:45:38 Drink water. 
Lather youself in coconut oil. 
Treat your real hair well. 
Get your nails done (toes too).

5241 2018-02-02 19:45:17 David, Thank you for reaching out to us.  This product does not actually contain lavender oil, it is a synthetic form.
5242 2018-02-02 19:45:13 What could be better than a dozen roses? A beautiful, #naturalproduct, of course! We're launching our brand new Valentine's Day-inspired Craft Series Body Oil on 2/5 at noon MST and we've lowered our free shipping to $75 until 2/7 at noon MST as well. #naturalskincare #osmia
5243 2018-02-02 19:44:58 My skin is so dry I literally just dumped a ton of straight up oil on my face and it was absorbed and gone in 3 minutes #ihatewinter

If here and no we follow the constitution we're okay, let's start with first three and go from there we'll see how far we get before we say:Okay let's get through the ammends

yaitu : cengkeh (cloves) & pala (nutmeg), serta no.2 dalam karet
alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
5249 2018-02-02 19:43:44 The smoke and fire sets issues caused to clear land for oil palm is totally outraged and thank goodness mipá is against it even though it's been known as the most effective way to do it. This has to stop as an annual problem in the area.
5250 2018-02-02 19:43:40 its putins goal to get rid of/or make less powerful, nato and the UN

its russia goal to protect assad, trump has already done that

and we know flynn had a plan to work with russia to take over the middle east and steal oil

i mean so much!!! #YouFailed
5251 2018-02-02 19:43:34 What do I do with the advice "man up"? Drink some oil? Eat some spanners? Grow a third testicle?
5252 2018-02-02 19:43:34 oil city ocean eyes hahahaha
5253 2018-02-02 19:43:20 Braise in butter, lemon, salt pepper, olive oil in a roasting pan at 250 until par-cooked. Remove, toss with buffalo sauce (butter, teriyaki, Franks) in a bowl and then finish on the grill to char up and get crispy
5254 2018-02-02 19:43:17 For my "Arthritis" and joint pain they give me muscle relaxers and 600mg ibuprofen.  I been taking Turmeric and Krill oil instead.  Feel waaaaaaay better
5255 2018-02-02 19:43:07 That would be amazing. The ringing in my ears is incredibly loud and I hear consonants wrong. Been trying Lipo Flavonoid, but I think its snake oil.
5256 2018-02-02 19:42:59 day 1 of keto and already tried to drink olive oil out of the bottle like a hot pregnant guy
5257 2018-02-02 19:42:54 Keep your oil paintings this is just engineering beauty
5258 2018-02-02 19:42:23 brendan facetimes me to tell me how when he went to go get an oil change he came back with 4 fish after. what kind of place do you get your oil changed and get fish??
5259 2018-02-02 19:42:08 My mother is currently group texting photos of partial magazine recipes while she’s getting an oil change. Directions for one recipe, ingredients for another
5260 2018-02-02 19:42:06 (2014) ESTIMATED THAT AS MANY AS 21,000 US GALLONS OF OIL WERE STILL CONTAMINATING THE AREA
5261 2018-02-02 19:41:49 Maybe the GOP used to be a fine-tuned dictatorial command machine, but which fool is in charge now? At this point, it's anyone's guess. Oil cronies are definitely up there. A neo-nazi impostor in the white house may also have some influence.
5262 2018-02-02 19:41:24 You are letting a once proud and sensible nation that used to be about what was right slide into a mire while blindly following a snake oil salesman.
5263 2018-02-02 19:41:07 Mexicans in the United States remitted $28 BILLION!!! That’s more money than they generate from exporting oil!
5264 2018-02-02 19:41:01 Still a bit of mileage in the old one if I check the oil and water regularly.
5265 2018-02-02 19:40:47 (2010) ITS ESTIMATED THAT THERE WAS STILL 23,000 US GALLONS OF OIL IN THE SAND AND SOIL AROUND THE AREA
5266 2018-02-02 19:40:41 What about her kids? You know, in 30 years when nobody is buying oil? Recession combined with millions of climate refugees, good long term strategy mate!
5267 2018-02-02 19:40:34 I'm getting my oil changed and watching Head of the Class. Remember that show? I miss shows like this.
5268 2018-02-02 19:40:33 Only in the oil industry would 20% profit be considered a failure for a company. Never be fooled that they are hurting and not making enough.
5269 2018-02-02 19:40:24 As a small oil and gas royalty owner I would like to tracel with an "emotional support Goldman Sachs energy analyst" #OOTT

5271 2018-02-02 19:40:12 I live 25 miles from a nice plot of federal lands which needs oil derricks a plenty. The White House or how about a gas well on the National Mall. American's would oppose our lands in DC drilled. Then why is it OK to drill on our land out west?
5272 2018-02-02 19:40:08 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
5273 2018-02-02 19:40:00 the fear mongering of oil $ not being US is nonsense..... SA is an ally, more importantly. China and Russia have basic flaws, the leader of China has power for life and putin is a despot....
5274 2018-02-02 19:39:39 I have no doubt that Donnie has vast investments in the oil and gas industries. That is the only explanation for his desire to return us to the dark ages.  He wants to spike his dividends!! And he thinks we won’t figure this out since he won’t provide his tax returns. Ha.
5275 2018-02-02 19:39:33 I need gas, an oil change, rent is due, utility bills are due. Help.
5276 2018-02-02 19:39:16 Doesn't expect to get any votes from military.  Will slowly choke the military and the oil sector.
5277 2018-02-02 19:39:13 Love that you can see an oil derrick on top of the hill. Such a strange part of LA.
5278 2018-02-02 19:39:01 The Debt market... the FED will not come here as last ressort to buy  30 Year T Bond (this is connected to oil the $ and reshape of oil cartel)

5280 2018-02-02 19:38:43 too funny!!!
5281 2018-02-02 19:38:34 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
5282 2018-02-02 19:38:25 #Islamaphobia the greatest disease of 21st century millions killed, raped, abused, tortured, enslaved  discriminated against; their homes hospitals schools destroyed. Museums ransacked oil and gold stolen. 100s of thousands displaced and now refugees. Zionists dreams come true
5283 2018-02-02 19:38:21 Which is exactly my point. There will be no resources to deal with half a million tonnes of oil in the water and on the beaches. A major earthquake off Vancouver Island or Wash won't leave any time for moving a supertanker. Waves move 500 mph.
5284 2018-02-02 19:38:19 Shut up, you environment-wrecking, oil industry-owned dirtbag. You're wasting our money on extra security and your stupid cone of silence, all while making sure that those that you are beholden to get what they want at our expense as they poison the water, air, land, and us.
5285 2018-02-02 19:38:18 ....Jesse I just threatened to manually disassemble your body with my thighs. At least have the decency to be a little afraid. *Still rubbing in beard oil*

5287 2018-02-02 19:37:52 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.

5291 2018-02-02 19:37:28 Your welcome, the only reasons for plastic straws was the fact that they are cheap, but they cost the planet dearly not only for pollution but because of the use of fossil oil in plastic which is a finite resource.

Now the @USEmbassyKenya led by @BobGodec and @StateDept care less about our cries for electoral justice and adherance rule of law for they do so too... They'll turn us into Iraq for their selfish gains of oil.

5309 2018-02-02 19:34:32 I’d be coming HOT off the starting blocks at that POS as well.

5311 2018-02-02 19:34:28 Then you better quit using ANYTHING that is made with oil products. Plastics (including your computer and your glasses), your rain boots and jackets, don't use transit or a vehicle... because according to you, it should be completely shut down.
5312 2018-02-02 19:34:24 The funny thing is that you and Jordan arent even REALLY conservative.. Someone dropped the overton window and its sliding down a melting glacier covered in snot and oil. Good luck catching it :p ... :/
5313 2018-02-02 19:34:03 98% sustainable palm oil. 2 years to go before the big 2020 100% sustainable. Best of luck. #palmoilvirtue
5314 2018-02-02 19:34:01 @JimStoppani how many servings of fish oil should I do a day? My capsules are 1400mg
5315 2018-02-02 19:33:55 Meus zinimigos estão no poder ¹!
5316 2018-02-02 19:33:47 They had zero need for the dossier to have probable cause to obtain a FISA warrant. Page's own passing of oil/energy related intelligence to the Russians was all that's needed. Also, he went to Moscow to give an anti-America speech...
5317 2018-02-02 19:33:21 oli not oil
5318 2018-02-02 19:33:16 "Govt believes in long run UK worse off #Brexit than inside EU". 
Report doesn't show that. What is margin of error? 0.3% p/y? Then zero change is within MOE. $20 rise in price of oil will have more impact. Fundamentally report predicts GOVT BELIEVES #BREXIT BENIGN AT WORST
5319 2018-02-02 19:33:16 my mom pulled me out of school because she didn’t want to go get an oil change by herself 
5320 2018-02-02 19:33:16 Jimboman the date in the notebook is off. Glad to see big white arrow down!
5321 2018-02-02 19:33:12 That’s because they have an oil plan
5322 2018-02-02 19:33:10 oil for the win
5323 2018-02-02 19:33:09 after I watched your hits & shits I've been getting a thousand ads everywhere for squalene oil so like they're truly listening
5324 2018-02-02 19:33:06 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
5325 2018-02-02 19:33:05 Dow -+500 points is the right direction, but a) DJIA is to an index what Gartman is to oil prices, and b) they had a coin desk for 3 days at the ATH so hugs.
5326 2018-02-02 19:32:48 @scifri I’m listening to your show on energy and China. It is clear the Trump administration is going backwards and handing China economic prominence in the renewable energy market. @Potus is owned by the oil and gas donor class. Sad for our future due to his ignorance.
5327 2018-02-02 19:32:16 Some in govt want to exterminate all wild  on OUR public lands. They will then allow welfare ranchers and oil companies to drill and destroy. Pls  ur House & Senate Reps: Protect wild ! No slaughter, killing, euthanasia or sale to those who will! Be their voice!
5328 2018-02-02 19:32:05 Hosu oo, you don throway oil oo... #AMBattleground
5329 2018-02-02 19:32:00 Thank you! I’ll definitely try the oil i need it 
5330 2018-02-02 19:31:57 Apple cidar vinegar, Rose water and coconut oil are my new skin favourites, hope it works well for me
5331 2018-02-02 19:31:55 I'd personally prefer to buy oil from the Russians instead of the Saudis - in general premise, but not with the corrupt Putin admin as it exists now.
5332 2018-02-02 19:31:48 I need to learn how to do oil changes man  smh
5333 2018-02-02 19:31:45 U.S. crude #oil futures settle at $65.45/bbl. $0.35. -0.53%. #CME #NYMEX #CL_H7 #OOTT

5341 2018-02-02 19:30:42 my moms mad at me because i told her you're not supposed to leave shrimp scampi in the oil and butter because its not a soup and apparently she liked it like that and hates that i didnt
5342 2018-02-02 19:30:37 I need to get up take baby to get a oil change & detailed
5343 2018-02-02 19:30:28 .@sciencevs (If I may be so bold) Some show ideas: 1) microwaves; 2) coconut oil. Thanks for bringing science to me the way I like it - evidence-based and with humour. @wendyzuk @Gimletmedia #podcasts #sciencevs #PeerReview

5348 2018-02-02 19:29:48 That can be negotiated. Just ask them to help reconstruct the country for a certain trade deal on the oil. If you are not sneaky and act like you are negotiating in good faith you can learn to get along. Look how President Reagan did with USSR Gorbachev. They found common ground.
5349 2018-02-02 19:29:45 What a leader!  I sold my oil and pipeline stocks last week because I knew we could count on him.
5350 2018-02-02 19:29:15 الأمن و الأمان مو مرتبط بالنظام الدكتاتوري و لا لازم تُحتكر السلطة و تستولي فئة على الثروة عشان يصير امان و ما يصير فينا مثل سوريا.   انا مواطن حر من شبه الجزيرة العربية و لا اقبل بإحتكار السلطة و الإستيلاء على الثروة و القمع و انتهاك حقوق المواطنين في بلادي
5351 2018-02-02 19:29:01 In case you're keeping score @JustinTrudeau's government will only protect our coastlines and safeguard the climate if and when we let a Texas oil company build an unwanted pipeline through BC... #cdnpoli #kindermorgan
5352 2018-02-02 19:29:00 I think it's an oil filled sack that lets fish float?
5353 2018-02-02 19:28:56 Also Trump has started something which will bring about his demise sooner than later..and the market senses that.
5354 2018-02-02 19:28:54 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
5355 2018-02-02 19:28:15 Got my school stuff figured out for my car washed got my oil change eyebrows done like I’m getting things  done today love this energy 
5356 2018-02-02 19:28:07 You know what infuriates me? Literally every time I take my car in to get an oil change I end up having to spend like $400 on shit that’s wrong with my car. Is that normal????
5357 2018-02-02 19:28:03 Profit? She’s having you on - she found that fiver under one of the massage tables. It had neroli oil all over it.
5358 2018-02-02 19:27:59 Large cap oil majors reported less than expected earnings leading indexes to drop. Liberals should be happy about that, right?
5359 2018-02-02 19:27:53 Do I look like your monkey?  Go do your own research - why not start with the work written by the Executive Director of the Institute for Poilcy Research and Development.  The West’s motivation in the Middie East and North Africa is the control of oil production.
5360 2018-02-02 19:27:48 Buy some Hyluaronic Acid serum and apply it then seal it with rose hip oil on top. DO NOT use coconut oil on your face its comedogenic and causes acne.

5363 2018-02-02 19:27:24 Yep that's it. The British oil which is strangely nowt to do with the UK.

5365 2018-02-02 19:26:56 finally getting my oil changed.
5366 2018-02-02 19:26:52 Olive oil and spices :)  Rosemary and crushed pepper and garlic were the ones I could identify.

5369 2018-02-02 19:26:36 يعني ما يصير ان النظام السعودي دكتاتوري عميل فاسد يحتكر السلطة و ينتهك حقوق الإنسان؟  ما في سبب يخلي الإنسان يعترض على النظام السعودي الا انه يكون عميل ايران او عميل تركيا؟ هذا لانك انت و النظام السعودي عملاء يا دبوس تفكر كل الناس مثلكم.  انا انسان حر لست تابعا لأحد

5376 2018-02-02 19:25:57 Good evening, before you insult me. I am not trying to defend buhari or his appointment but i was just curious as to how business men (dangote, oil maketers, etc), elected officials (Senate president and speaker) became part of nepotism?

5378 2018-02-02 19:25:38 Comment on facts not sentiments. Schlumberger is the biggest oil service coy in the world. For so many years the CEO was an accountant
5379 2018-02-02 19:25:34 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
5380 2018-02-02 19:25:22 Oil never know when to stop.
5381 2018-02-02 19:25:21 mike told me u can use olive oil for everything
5382 2018-02-02 19:25:11 Oil be mining tonight.
5383 2018-02-02 19:25:09 I had so many branches to deal with and learned how to get eucalyptus sap off your hands (the secret is olive oil).
5384 2018-02-02 19:25:08 I need more then just oil nigga
5385 2018-02-02 19:25:05 Oil save you!
5386 2018-02-02 19:24:39 Well oil be damned.
5387 2018-02-02 19:24:37 Oil pulling @ the bus stop
5388 2018-02-02 19:24:32 I have come to the conclusion that Donald Trump isn't incompetent. He's an IDIOT. Has America become so disillusioned that they put their faith in a snake oil seller. You used to tar and feather them not make them President. He has destroyed America and the Constitution
5389 2018-02-02 19:24:18 I'm getting miffed been here 30 min and still waiting for my oil change don't tell me 1pm and not get my car In . Poor service for a dealership
5390 2018-02-02 19:24:16 Eat the Rich or Love in an Elevator
5391 2018-02-02 19:24:08 I think it is classed as a eureka moment. How do they overcome the boiling hot oil in a bumpy van situation surely health and safety violation
5392 2018-02-02 19:24:05 People who "can't cook" drive me nuts. It's like bitch, just throw like three things in a pan with some oil and pepper. It'll be fine.

5395 2018-02-02 19:23:42 @SueinRockville Heard your comment on @StephMillerShow this morning, and your theory is way more nefarious that I could have thought. But given the 19% sale of Rosneft (oil) went to Trump who says climate change is a hoax to boast oil sales... the theory has merit.
5396 2018-02-02 19:23:38 Well thank you so much.
I really appreciate your reply,  it made my day.  
I will start the hot oil and all on  Sunday and I will report back on the effects after a while.
5397 2018-02-02 19:23:35 Is this the reason for the late rally?
5398 2018-02-02 19:23:31 I haven’t tried the tincture or patches but a massage starting with the releaf balm —letting it soak in for a few minutes, followed by deeper massage with the massage oil is heavenly. 
5399 2018-02-02 19:23:26 
5400 2018-02-02 19:23:24 “we going to get your oil changed tomorrow”

dihhh
5401 2018-02-02 19:23:12 I used to love Bosh but I just saw them post a recipe for oil free stir fry that uses CUCUMBER WATER INSTEAD OF OIL and now that's me done forever
5402 2018-02-02 19:23:08 Just be consistent and the future of the middle east region will be profitable for everyone. You've made your growth because of Persia, because of its Companies, because of its oil and natural resources. Foreigners made deal with you because of it,
5403 2018-02-02 19:22:59 (Beautiful but) economically catastrophic
Also Triumph motorbikes failure,  patronising "beer & sandwiches" north sea oil disinvestment 
In summary a walking disaster
5404 2018-02-02 19:22:59 I slid out of the working week on a puddle of engine oil and biscuit crumbs...happy weekend.
5405 2018-02-02 19:22:52 I'd opt for Midnight Oil. Hear its in the pipeline!
5406 2018-02-02 19:22:24 I just came for an oil change not conversation
5407 2018-02-02 19:22:20 Olvidate q si, lo q no estaria sabiendo si ahi ya comiste la pizza de la oil
5408 2018-02-02 19:22:17 Trudeau keeps arguing that the economy and environment are not at odds. He's right. But that's not the question. The question is whether oil and the environment are at odds. And there he's wrong. They are at odds. Don't build pipelines through BC.

5410 2018-02-02 19:22:05 I can only imagine how many granola heads they will bus in to protest the pipeline. Question though, do  the US special interest groups who are anti CDN oil pay these enviro activists directly in cash or do they submit invoices?
5411 2018-02-02 19:22:05 dude i love their brand! i would use just a cleanser for my face for oil and damn my face was clear in a week
5412 2018-02-02 19:21:50 Ta mate. Good man, sound great enjoy your well earned oil 
5413 2018-02-02 19:21:47 نحن جميعا الفقراء والله هو الغني ...
5414 2018-02-02 19:21:38 So true - focus should be on fiber not protein. An oil free WFPB 80/10/10 ratio (whole carb/protein/fat) should generally provide more than enough. When I tracked everything eaten over 3 days I had just over upper limit for fiber.
5415 2018-02-02 19:21:37 Where is the body oil from? What’s the name?

5417 2018-02-02 19:21:33 That's ok. My wife and daughters say that my default state is confused anyways. Have a great weekend. Hopefully next week oil bulls are taken to the cleaners for a while.
5418 2018-02-02 19:21:28 Wrap your hair and keep a silk scarf on and a light oil

5422 2018-02-02 19:20:22 Just to add perspective on 25 Billion for the wall, it's really not all that much.  BP Oil put 20 Billion in escrow to pay claims to oil spill victims alone - and that is just one company. They could not give the money away as it accured interest.
5423 2018-02-02 19:20:10 Gonna soak my body in oil this weekend and pray for the best

5490 2018-02-02 19:19:00 And I do believe proper regulation in sub-Saharan Africa would help their issues with poverty. These areas are being exploited by oil and mineral companies who make tremendous profits that don’t help local economies.
5491 2018-02-02 19:18:53 Imagine now the extra cost for milk, beef, pork, chicken, cheese, yogourt, oil cartels just to name a few.
5492 2018-02-02 19:18:49 Good. If anyone needs education it is you.

Did you tell them if they study hard and run for office then they could get in bed with big oil and destroy the environment?

Gotta be a School House Rock episode about that, right? "I'm just a shill, yes, I'm only a shill..."
5493 2018-02-02 19:18:45 I’m sitting waiting to get my oil changed: I’ve been here for 2 hr, I’m hungry, I gotta work at 5 and I need to fit a nap in

5523 2018-02-02 19:14:17 My last was a '98 Olds Alero. Nothing but trouble from day one. Around 2 years old, oil found it's way from the engine into my braking system. GM bought me of it, declared it a lemon.
5524 2018-02-02 19:14:16 @AlbertaatNoon   I’m very excited for the new job opportunities, the oil field jobs were mostly trough nepotism.
Now it levels the playing field.

5526 2018-02-02 19:13:39 It is honest not all of us. We just have more than our share of poor-me negative mouth breathers who bitch about how hard they have, and refuse to shut the fuck up. many (most?) are young men who have moved here to work in oil. Most of us weather the highs and lows with optimism.

5533 2018-02-02 19:12:37 Now my car needs an oil change. Thanks a lot #NunesMemo
5534 2018-02-02 19:12:29 In the near-term, enhanced oil recovery (if oil prices sufficient) can create financial incentive to at least advance CCS. That's what drove forward Petra Nova, which has only modest government support (about 16% of the project cost IIRC).
5535 2018-02-02 19:12:25 Yeah that's everyone's been telling me to add an oil.. i just dont want something to clog my pores and make me break it
5536 2018-02-02 19:12:23 When you guys build refinery in Katsina,  make sure you have the crude there too because you can't suck crude oil from Niger Delta to be refined there,   otherwise come and build the refinery in Delta or Bayelsa
5537 2018-02-02 19:12:14 Be here at 1 for an oil change 1:11 car still isn't in the bay really wth?
5538 2018-02-02 19:12:10 Very Predictable - Pocket media will be burning the midnight oil - creating specious counter "arguments" to confuse the collective.
5539 2018-02-02 19:12:00 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5540 2018-02-02 19:11:59 If prices were led by consumer product demand,  rather than an inflated bubble of financial oil demand from Managed Money #BigLong (NOT hedge funds because down the curve from Months 2/3) then cracks would not be compressed
5541 2018-02-02 19:11:58 "The industry" is not monolithic and definitely does not all share that view. I've talked to a lot of oil & gas companies and IPPs that see CCS as important option value at very least and are investing accordingly.
5542 2018-02-02 19:11:51 Screw Alberta. All they Want is Oil Money and they Don't Care How Many Die from Pollution from Their Oil. Many of My Family are in the Oil Business, Screw Them Too, Bunch of Violent Alcholics and Drug Addicts. Very Popular Activities for Oil People. #Sum
5543 2018-02-02 19:11:46 Its so bad for your scalp  

Since your hair is still short, you can spritz with water daily (only use shampoo once a week cos too much dehydrates hair) and use an oil mix to moisturise. Coconut oil mixed with a few other oils (avocado, castor and rosemary) will do
5544 2018-02-02 19:11:44 @arunjaitley Nothing for middle class people in ur budget. Infact you are looting common public by increasing crude oil prices on daily basis. Cut down excise duties which u increased when crude oil were cheap.otherwise time has come to throw bjp in opposition again.

5563 2018-02-02 19:09:39 @tweetrbell Misleading the public by changing the name from Tar Sands to Oil Sands, does not change billions of Bitumen to Oil. That's what Upgraders do. Misleading the Public into thinking Diluted Bitumen is going to be Shipped to Asia is also doing a huge disservice!
5564 2018-02-02 19:09:28 1) Oil is subsidized far less than solar/wind according to Obama Admin.
2) Speaking of the Obama Admin, did you support his bailout of the auto companies? I didn't.
3) Agree that people should take responsibility for impact, but subsidies are chosen by politics, not effectiveness

5580 2018-02-02 19:07:12 The oil industry is subsidized and auto industry was recipient of one of the largest govt bailouts ever. Govt support of fossil fuels is pretty evident. Fossil fuel consumption poses health & enviro risks that both public and private entities have interest in addressing.

5589 2018-02-02 19:05:42 Colorado has hydro electric. Minnesota has a biomass plant. Natural gas is clean burning fuel. But what about all the environmental impacts from manufacturing and shipping, for example, wind turbines? Coal train still move those blades. Crude oil still burns to make those panels?
5590 2018-02-02 19:05:31 Is that right! And by the end of the 1970's there was to be no oil left in the world. Yet here in 2018, there is more oil being consumed then ever before.

5595 2018-02-02 19:04:51 that's irrelevant. the content of the law is the issue. the fact that an extremist law is passed does not mean its no longer extremist. a man who supports it, denies population inflation & opposes the oil derivation principle is an extremist.....

5627 2018-02-02 19:01:40 And I have always believed that is Trump and Putin's alternate plan. Main plan was to lift sanctions so Putin could drill for oil. If that didn't work, then do what it takes to change the world's view of America. Isolation from all but Russia.

5644 2018-02-02 19:00:07 @tweetrbell Shipping Refined Oil Products by Tanker, is infinitely safer than shipping Diluted Bitumen. Exporting Diluted Bitumen by Tanker means extreme Environmental Dangers!

5699 2018-02-02 18:51:49 Sometimes we all have to do things we may not support for the good of the country as a whole. The ability to move our oil to Asia easily will force our main customer (the USA) to pay a more competitive rate for our resources. Having more options is good for Canada as a whole.

5735 2018-02-02 18:48:44 Oh man this nation is in deep trouble. Imagine Donald Trump being presented as anything other than a huckster of Snack Oil.
5736 2018-02-02 18:48:37 Also used tanning oil & lotions...worked fairly well. I'm like the SunscreenNaziMom! Especially at the beach! I'm like  -> Kids, you'll thank me some day!
5737 2018-02-02 18:48:29 Friendly reminder that if u take a moral high ground when it comes to food but only pay attention to ur meat consumption plz also look in your cabinets and throw out everything that has palm oil, the most unethical crop pretty much ever.
5738 2018-02-02 18:47:59 Sick this oil spilled on my joggers 
5739 2018-02-02 18:47:56 I need to go get a oil change
5740 2018-02-02 18:47:36 I’m drowning my body in coconut oil this weekend cause of this bipolar ass weather
5741 2018-02-02 18:47:28 I wonder if Mystic Buick has gotten an oil change in the last 3,000 miles...
5742 2018-02-02 18:47:24 Yes there is that, I left a gorgeous one at our old house, Swampy even routed a lovely pattern around it so I want it again but in the utility. Swamp will rub it down and oil it, he likes a bit of maintenance, cant sit still.
5743 2018-02-02 18:47:17     Beard oil. Kill me please
5744 2018-02-02 18:47:13 I think it's more important if they consolidate, saves kurds and helps Syrians. You split the oil and you damage the country in total, Syria can barely pay for the reconstruction of their major cities and because of the American campaign in Syria, Raqqa is obliterated.
5745 2018-02-02 18:47:07 Living in west Texas where we have to ration water often lately it's not as easy as you think you use more daily than you think we can make sure everyone has oil and gas but not water we're not trying hard enough
5746 2018-02-02 18:47:04 Except we’re not. Demand for oil is increasing, and there is not even line-of-sight to when we might see “peak oil” consumption.  Perhaps less time lobbying the producers, and more time lobbying the consumers?
5747 2018-02-02 18:46:48 Why is the federal government so much concerned with the private business of herdsmen and interfering with internal state security laws. The federal government has never anytime demonstrated that for the fisherman and farmers of the Niger Delta from oil firms.
5748 2018-02-02 18:46:35 cheers guys, it’ll be pouring tonight in Hamilton :-)
5749 2018-02-02 18:46:32 Who rubs beard oil on the head? The name is in the title. We might need to examine some of the men in your life save me
5750 2018-02-02 18:46:14 @jjhorgan Can you put together a scientific panel on how to prevent and/or reduce the risks of an oil spill happening? I think everyone can agree that oil introduced to an environment is bad. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
5751 2018-02-02 18:46:03 What a price to pay. Maybe if we were all more aware of the impact palm oil has on the natural world we could and would do more.
5752 2018-02-02 18:46:01 Yes their 5.4%GDP compared to 1.7%, 200000 jobs in January, industry coming back not leaving,overtaking Saudi Aribia and Russia in oil production, more money in middle class pockets,higher wages,$1000 bonuses for thousands of employees, investment capital pouring in. Wake up.
5753 2018-02-02 18:45:46 Blend 4 1/2 tbsps Ahi Tuna with 4 cups ham. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with salmon
5754 2018-02-02 18:45:44 Beard oil? Cos it's obviously not working
5755 2018-02-02 18:45:43 We know profit is good 4 the business WE work 4 or WE own. Why not also 4 every business? #Selfish profit is good 4 small salon and big oil.
5756 2018-02-02 18:45:17 Buttercup is doing good. All we need to do for her hip is get some joint medicine and fish oil and give her some asprin when it gets bad like it was the other day. She did lose some weight tho. But other than that she should be fine, YAY!!! :)
5757 2018-02-02 18:45:14 Why is every time that I jump in the wife’s vehicle she is either 1000 miles overdue for an oil change or the gas gauge is on E? Absolutely infuriating.
5758 2018-02-02 18:44:50 I am such hipster trash. I love me some truffle oil. Hah!
5759 2018-02-02 18:44:44 i hate getting my oil changed by myself
5760 2018-02-02 18:44:30 Groundnut oil????
5761 2018-02-02 18:44:27 It is better. But no way they let it happen, because it would end monopolies. Like the oil guys are scared clean energy will take over. And you know the money in that has made Governments!
5762 2018-02-02 18:44:05 In the waiting room at the dealership getting an oil change and whatnot and there’s this absolutely repulsive man just coughing and sneezing and picking his nose and farting and everyone in the room is just disgusted and uncomfortable
5763 2018-02-02 18:44:03 @JohnKDelaney  What will you do about Fracking and oil ruining our water? What will you do to prevent digging on Sacred Tribal Lands? Bears Ears? KXL? Indigenous People want to know.
5764 2018-02-02 18:43:59 - Only lane 1 remains closed. Severe delays continue to ease - currently slow moving traffic back to J12. Resurfacing has taken place due to an oil spill.
5765 2018-02-02 18:43:44 Is changing ur oil easy it sounds hella hard
5766 2018-02-02 18:43:34 Monroe at the 5 and Horford at his natural position PF will be tough for the NBA. Buckle up Celtics fans!!! Trader Danny is burning that midnight oil!!!!
5767 2018-02-02 18:43:25 Thank you baby and all i do is drink plenty of water. Exfoliating once a week. And coconut oil every morning and night before bed 
5768 2018-02-02 18:43:21 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
5769 2018-02-02 18:43:11 Well we've all grown up with a multitude of cultures it's only in the last 15 years..... Since the west has bombed the middle east for oil, pipelines the petrol-dollar & for the Saudis there's been all this Anti-Muslim sentiment. 
They'd not be any of this if we'd not bombed them
5770 2018-02-02 18:43:06 Burping up fish oil will hit you harder than coffee 
5771 2018-02-02 18:43:02 but check this out, without oil we wouldn't be able to make all the solar panels and John generators #irc #quotes #bot
5772 2018-02-02 18:42:58 Anyone want some coconut oil?
5773 2018-02-02 18:42:54 Hey @RachelNotley This is NOT an economic debate, so save your breath. This is about the survival of our species & other species on earth. Maybe you could help us instead of helping Big Oil? #bcpoli #cdnpoli
5774 2018-02-02 18:42:40 I bought the loreal extraordinary oil low shampoo and I hope my hair will be looking as good as @KaushalBeauty’s looks 
5775 2018-02-02 18:42:31 Getting my oil changed, and my car starts rocking, i started to freak out, then I realized that they were underneath my car.
5776 2018-02-02 18:42:18 Sauté with some olive oil, white wine, garlic and salt and pepper. Sprinkle with Parmesan and it’s really good.
5777 2018-02-02 18:42:15 Not one news agency is covering the story that for the first time in US history Russian tankers full of oil are on our shorelines. How this can not be significant to current WH events is beyond my understanding
5778 2018-02-02 18:42:14 Received some @LOrealParisUK elvive extraordinary oil multi use nourishing balm to try and OMG my hair after a few minutes of leaving in damp hair  definitely repurchasing 
5779 2018-02-02 18:42:09 Today’s one of those days where it really sucks to be an adult. Left the doc, he told me I have bronchitis or walking pneumonia and all I really wanna do is nap. But gotta take my car to bville to get the oil changed still

5783 2018-02-02 18:41:47 Our mechanic just heard the car and knew what was wrong with it, like wow my brothers ain’t shit. He taught me how to check the transmission oil and how much it needed, I’m so mad bc if I’d known I would’ve done it.  so quick and easy.
5784 2018-02-02 18:41:41 Oil change and getting that tire ro ro.
5785 2018-02-02 18:41:31 Goldman Says Investors ‘Largely Agreed’ With Bullish Oil View

And Goldman's prop desk is happy to sell all the oil investors want
5786 2018-02-02 18:41:28 All it would take would be some negotiations and willingness on both sides to compromise to make land from between all those border states. It would bring some peace to the area, would it not? But I think everyone is more interested in the oil on both sides now. Share it.

5788 2018-02-02 18:41:22 Texas made history yesterday guys!

The first dose of medical marijuana was legally delivered to a 6yr old girl who suffers from intractable epilepsy

Even tho it was straight CBD oil.. it's a tiny step but a step nonetheless towards medicinal marijuana in Texas!!
5789 2018-02-02 18:41:17 you need ingestion of cannabi oil vapor - it would open your airways ... granny taught me, i take pot of boiling water, put cannabis oil in it, put towel over ur head & breathe that vapor ...  i wish you could utilize it.
5790 2018-02-02 18:41:12 okay was cleaning my car and hanging my oil too and this masculine guy comes and say "do you need help? I know girls don't know anything about cars" first of all.... I DO bitch suck my dick thnx anyways loser
5791 2018-02-02 18:41:05 Yes
5792 2018-02-02 18:41:03 What is up with Food Growers in CA.  REPORTS are they are using Oil Fracking Water to hydrate Fruit and Vegetables.   Even Organic.  WHAT?
5793 2018-02-02 18:41:01 U.S. Rig Count is down 1 rig from last week to 946, with #oil rigs up 6 to 765
5794 2018-02-02 18:41:00 You do realise that vegans actively avoid palm oil (which is harmful to health like dairy saturated fat) because it involves torture and killing of orangutangs.  This was a weak attempt at a "tu quoque" fallacy.
5795 2018-02-02 18:40:42 You’re so welcome, but thank you for sharing your gift with the world. Your work on Wytches will always be my favorite. I wonder, are you also an oil painter?
5796 2018-02-02 18:40:39 Excellent choice
5797 2018-02-02 18:40:30 Restaurants that use peanut oil to cook need to put large signs with large print saying so.

5810 2018-02-02 18:39:24 Or lint getting inside or needing oil orz
5811 2018-02-02 18:39:21 I believe he Conservative party has members that deny the cause of climate change.... such as oil and gas caused...they are correct. You falsify the reality that since the dawn of earth, the earth has gone through numerous climate changes. It’s always changing. Not cuz of humans
5812 2018-02-02 18:39:19 You'll buy the whole olive oil popcorn! but you'll only need the EDGE!
5813 2018-02-02 18:39:18 Arnold you couldn't be more wrong in your belief of this. Until renewables are efficient we have no other choice. Would you have done curls with 10s if 50s were available?  That's the difference between oil/gas and renewables.
5814 2018-02-02 18:39:10 Bruh lmao I’m getting an oil change and the dude was like “yo oil change is gone be 79.95, is that gonna be okay” but his body language suggested I was a broke bitch 
5815 2018-02-02 18:38:31 It needs government oversight for sure.
If B.C./Canada is bearing the brunt of the risk, it's only fair that we dictate the safety margins.

But yeah ultimately the best way to lower risk would be to lower demand for oil as a whole.  That unfortunately is not in our power.
5816 2018-02-02 18:38:31 هذا اللي تشوفه نظام يبي يحمي كرامتك وعرضك ودينك فهمت ؟! واموالك
5817 2018-02-02 18:38:21 My favorite oil change place that didn’t ask you questions or care about your air filter got bought by a company that does all that. Oil Masters, you live on in my heart and respiratory system.
5818 2018-02-02 18:38:21 Dedicated to Palm Oil, deforestation and extinction of Orangutans...how do people even buy it least of all eat it ? #auspol
5819 2018-02-02 18:38:15 The goverment has no developmental plans whatsoever and over relies on oil revenues. The economy is deteriorating. Life is becoming unbearable for most of the populace. Our priority is only to blame any western government that warns our government.
5820 2018-02-02 18:38:11 Todays oil rate is $ 65.65 & $ 63.90 not $ 30.60
You are mistaken dear.
WTI Crude65.37-0.43-0.65%(10 minutes delay)

5822 2018-02-02 18:37:56 also leaves out Carter Page’s 2016 meeting with with Igor Sechin, a Putin ally and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now chief executive of Russian oil conglomerate Rosneft.
5823 2018-02-02 18:37:55 @tweetrbell Kinder Morgan Burnaby Terminal CANNOT handle large enough Tankers to make shipments to Asia competitive. Diluted Bitumen shipped through the TransMountain Pipeline WILL be Shipped to California Refineries! Ref. Mar 08/17 Art. Alberta Oil Magazine by Nick Wilson.
5824 2018-02-02 18:37:28 Could that be the uncoded oil...........
5825 2018-02-02 18:37:21 That is a very recent view of nature.. Look at all she has been through.. We had 2 major extinction events in earth history (that we know about).. We are severely over-populated.. that is the fundamental issue.. More than anything we do wrong with oil/gas/pollution - we breed !
5826 2018-02-02 18:36:51 @DougFairchild there’s an add for The Last Jedi on in the waiting room where I am getting my oil changed and I kinda wanna see it again after all our chats. Haha!

5833 2018-02-02 18:35:33 I don't know if you recall my rage over a book character claiming an unfinished oil painting would be deliverable in 4 days XD So... yeah
5834 2018-02-02 18:35:22 Is your dentist nice? Could you visit?
Myrrh essential oil or cloves are recommended for pain in the meantime.

5842 2018-02-02 18:34:31 Too much oil cake up
5843 2018-02-02 18:34:29 Why are you promoting articles that include other companies. how about address the shareholders at v.aao and v.moo only. oil has sky rocketed, Montana in play at $60 oil "remember" its been at $60 for a while now in fact mid to high 60s.
5844 2018-02-02 18:34:16 that just shows that they're not going to be responsible about operating it if they're not going to be responsible about building it. Also this is going to make a few people alot of money in the short term, leaving a scar on the landscape when we should be curbing oil dependency
5845 2018-02-02 18:34:14 Robert Mercer, an altogether deplorable human being, thinks we should just plunder Iraq for its oil (a violation of international law).
5846 2018-02-02 18:34:08 The only thing controversial was ref changing call twice. You can’t force the goalies glove into net with puck. States it clearly in rule book. Winnipeg and St. Louis have a case. Oil do not plain and simple.
5847 2018-02-02 18:34:05 i just love it when @mikexingchen mention hot oil likes it’s his bae or something 
5848 2018-02-02 18:34:04 Florida's R governor has already blocked this. Nobody wants oil drilling in their backyard.

5850 2018-02-02 18:33:36 The primary reason I'm in real estate, oil, gold, and silver is because the U.S. dollar has become the peso the world. It's becoming more and more worthless as the U.S. is the world's biggest debtor nation. Robert Kiyosaki

5859 2018-02-02 18:32:09 How is it showing that you love America when you tear up national parks in order to dig and destroy all for oil and coal and uranium that will benefit only your pocket.
5860 2018-02-02 18:32:05 Alberta needs to mind their own business. They've already polluted the north beyond repair. @RachelNotley that corrupt POS is a shill working for big oil. Crooked is as crooked does.
5861 2018-02-02 18:31:56 Getting my oil changed after work and it allows me to scope out a new truck I’m looking to get

5864 2018-02-02 18:31:50 apparently oil is now viewed as a flight to safety.  Gold?  meh.  $DXY, bah!  Even bitcoin, against a reason, is down!  Oil it is! #oott
5865 2018-02-02 18:31:49 To not be completely mean to your boss, you should give them 30 minutes to get someone to cover and then just walk out at the top of the hour.
5866 2018-02-02 18:31:36 I've never tried baby oil. I also didn't use sunscreen until my late 30s. My skin just tans, never burns. And I hope the same.
5867 2018-02-02 18:31:18 And the crude oil prices per barrel have also halved since congress' rule. I dont understand why are they increasing prices now.

5871 2018-02-02 18:30:37 OIL DIFF: 3.59 -> 3.66
5872 2018-02-02 18:30:35 Oh definently.
There needs to be worst case scenario plans and strategy to minimize risk.
B.C. is taking the brunt of that risk just having the pipeline/oil tankers.  Only fair to implement regulations to make sure that the chances of a spill are minimized and that it's damage is
5873 2018-02-02 18:30:30 You can smell my oil burner all the way from the elevator. You’re welcome neighbors. Because I went on another floor and it didn’t smell so good lmfao
5874 2018-02-02 18:30:29 Oh I'm ready for this pot of treason to boil over  some #ComplicitGOP are going to get burned. Oil burns, fourth degree burns
5875 2018-02-02 18:30:27 This guy doing my oil change has the prettiest eyes and the longest lashes
5876 2018-02-02 18:30:18 Fucking hell, Neck Oil is lush, no wonder John Robins lives drinking it so much.
5877 2018-02-02 18:30:17 Hey, I'm right here
I don't like being objectified like that
5878 2018-02-02 18:30:12 Reading Paddy Adenuga's viral piece, I kept wishing it was a renewable energy company, not an oil company

Well, we move!
5879 2018-02-02 18:30:08 cause the salad question alone let me know i was in for a bunch of “do you really use coconut oil for everything? hey babes, can i wear your thing you put on your head to sleep in? why don’t you like when i cook?”, and I’m not at that point in my life yet 
5880 2018-02-02 18:30:02 they cant say i didnt try to filter the oil
5881 2018-02-02 18:29:52 You hypocrites live in one of them. Instead of taking this message to the man who should hear it, you are playing wise on twitter. I guess oil in Cameroon is not as much as that in Libya and Afghanistan, or we aren't just so strategic for you to expand your empire.
5882 2018-02-02 18:29:37 I agree to the power of eleventy.
5883 2018-02-02 18:29:35 Who said it? “America must work towards energy independence. You know, last year 37 percent of the oil that America consumed was imported, and so far this year, that figure's up to almost 40 percent. And that trend means trouble.”
5884 2018-02-02 18:29:21 Plus it goes through a loooooot of highly contested first nations land, and with its extreme remoteness, impacts just to build it are gonna be astronomical. Monitoring is gonna be next to impossible too. Honestly, oil kinda has a no win solution with transportation.

5886 2018-02-02 18:29:09 Oil! Hahahahaha! Yep, Turkey invaded Iraq and destroyed all the country to sit on top of oil. Turkey has been controlling gulf countries to absorb the last bit of oil drop.
Oh wait, it is another country. Guess which one?
5887 2018-02-02 18:29:08 RW Reform Party noodleheads blame Pierre Trudeau for 'spending' even though both Harpie & Mulroney spent much more and accumulated MUCH more debt; blissfully unaware in PET era the Arab oil embargo, Iranian revolution etc caused an unprecedented spike in world inflation #cdnpoli

5896 2018-02-02 18:28:15 Oh, and your boy conducted his first oil change last night on the family vehicle. Small accomplishments, bit by bit.

Also if Oil prices fall from 67 to 65.
It causes stock market crashes.
5904 2018-02-02 18:27:25 Member Artwork: Robynann painted this beautiful painting of Lilies and Decanter in Oil. An absolute masterpiece. Can just see this hanging in a formal dining room for guests to appreciate. A beautiful composition. Well done! Do you also love this great painting?
5905 2018-02-02 18:27:18 This is something people have been doing since they burned oil in lamps. We do it less now because of indoor plumbing (regular bathing) & electricity (e- lights).

We also keep more indoor pets & have better insulation (low air exchange) which concentrates aromatic oil effects.
5906 2018-02-02 18:27:16 Tar sands oil is more expensive but if tar sand asset and fracking were not developed - where would the price of oil be in N. America? Market share aspect and oligopoly pricing behavior must be used-  not tradional "market" theory to analyze Tar sand investment.

5908 2018-02-02 18:27:10 Sweetest thing just happened while getting my oil changed. Dude thought that, because we were talking about video games and I'm obviously into them, that I was about 33. Awww. 

Dudes. Just because we are 40 or over doesn't mean we stop liking the things we love. Like, ever.
5909 2018-02-02 18:27:03 CL almost a dollar off the lows with a stronger usd and 6 more rigs out in shale country. Makes complete sense. Sold to you again #OOTT #OPEC #OIL
5910 2018-02-02 18:26:57 Remember how the US opened up the vast majority of our coastline for oil exploration and drilling a month ago?
5911 2018-02-02 18:26:40 I should just quit.
5912 2018-02-02 18:26:28 $CVX 4Q profits up helped by tax cut, rev results fell short, rising oil was expeted to help more, today oil is down adding to the downturn.

5914 2018-02-02 18:26:19 Nunes must be looking for a payout from Russians, maybe he sees allowing them to drill for oil on his farm? or find some other resource there that they want but are denied right now?
5915 2018-02-02 18:26:10 DIY Hair Mask:
1 tbsp Coconut Oil

5917 2018-02-02 18:26:09 He did more than just talk, he was the 1 man show behind Global Energy Capital that specialized in the Russian oil business. You can go look up his pro-Putin anti-US comments he’s made over the year.

Why anyone on on either side would defend this guy is beyond me.
5918 2018-02-02 18:26:08 Ugh! No fun. I never went to a tanning bed place. So much easier/cheaper to break out the baby oil and the lawn chair in the backyard! (*Still hoping I don't get skin cancer!)

5925 2018-02-02 18:24:52 I’ll take her earnest statement over your snake oil any day.
5926 2018-02-02 18:24:46 Keep “fucking that chicken”, Hal. The essential nature of a closed epistemology is its ability to help you deny reality.
Like thinking that appointing a cabinet full of Goldman Sachs executives, oil CEOs, billionaires and generals is somehow “murdering the Establishment”.

5929 2018-02-02 18:24:33 I find with the tincture market there are a lot of snake oil salesmen and pyramid sales schemes going on. A great deal of placebo effect. But depending on if you are a cannabis user or not directly effects how much CBD works on your body. I don't use Cannabis.

5943 2018-02-02 18:23:00 Sure because his cabinet LOVES oil and coal even though it pollutes and his base works in the coalmines and oil fields.  Solar is cheap and free.
5944 2018-02-02 18:22:50 You can't tell Nigerians like me this statement because you are not in position to advice people like me you are in UK enjoying all the goodies of this world and leaving behind your people in the Delta in puberty and hunger with no infrastructure despite being oil producers.shame

5951 2018-02-02 18:21:57 Nice spin. But no. Facts are stubborn things, such as the fact the dossier wasn't produced until the DNC started paying Fusion GPS.

6020 2018-02-02 18:14:22 So how it can be possible to predict such a news ?? Even multi-multi-trillion markets (aka "fiat currency", Oil, Gold) are very sensitive to some "Black swan" events. So what you expect from ~400-500 bn market fully dependant from the will of authorities ?
6021 2018-02-02 18:14:07 10 year yield above 3%, oil prices, pmi data, and core CPI and PCE short term should do that but all 3 need to move up together with world trade data getting hotter. Duration period will be small ... that 1.60% -3% 10 year yield channel I talk about will still be intact
6022 2018-02-02 18:14:03 Mr. Oil Spill is about to hear from BC!
6023 2018-02-02 18:14:01 Once established, pipelines are the lowest risk & impact transportation of oil, yes, but also the most difficult to monitor & repair when leaks do occur due to their length & remoteness.

6035 2018-02-02 18:12:16 It gets cold enough here, occasionally, that LCD screens start to freeze up. The oil in them isn't water, but it is liquid.

6037 2018-02-02 18:12:03 The world is going green.  Developed world are moving away from oil.  Oil prices haven't risen to significant prices  since 2014. Solar,  wind,  and nuclear isn't being discussed. Nig can't manage its refineries, yet we building close to Niger.

6040 2018-02-02 18:11:40 So this is a case of "not in my backyard" also known as being a hypocrite. You want all the benefits of oil but someone else should deal with the negative sides. People like you are the problem. You probably think it's a better idea to import it than use Canadian oil #getaclue

6137 2018-02-02 18:00:46 You realize we are  a 2 trillion dollar economy. No 100$ oil like Harper had, and economy still thriving.  100m$ is peanuts regardless.
6138 2018-02-02 18:00:44 Trade GM’s... Magic for Jerry West & throw in Mr.Softee or as I like to call him Olive Oil. Maybe Clippers will throw in a 2nd round  pick. West will bring a balanced & tough team, plus a new coach.....

6144 2018-02-02 18:00:01 Thank you Arnold. I agree when so we force the old billionaires out of Oil and into renewable energy that we have been developing since the time of Nikola Tesla- The Father of Wireless energy.
6145 2018-02-02 17:59:55 Glad you see this. Its the oil in Turkana, Kenya they are after. "American interests". The US is about to do Kenya dirty. If you want to kill a dog, start by soiling its name. Words like terrorist are not far away now either.

6157 2018-02-02 17:58:19 Oil still looks good for lower given this current intraday bounce.  So long as y'day's HOD 66.25 keeps a lid on it should be good to take out that 63.67 for a move to 61
6158 2018-02-02 17:58:14 I have a funny pesto story. I was cooking something kinda freestyle just adding stuff. I add some basil, garlic, oil, parmesan... then grabbed the pesto "hmm this might be good". added it. Then I said "wait, what's in this pesto anyway? Basil, garlic, parmesan... lol.

6170 2018-02-02 17:57:06 All that oil shit is distracting.  Like who has to clean all that up? It's oil, do they have to detergent the floors in those nice ass houses? What if they have wood floors? I might be desensitized to porn but that oil flying around gives me anxiety.
6171 2018-02-02 17:57:04 Alberta should restrict the flow of Oil / Gas to improve pricing, and Alberta should be removed from the equalization formula so all taxation derived from natural resources is returned to the province or origin.

6211 2018-02-02 17:52:24 Apologies in advance for the novice question:  How exactly do you use the coconut oil for cleaning your face?  Slather & remove with soap?  Or put some on a cotton pad, swipe, & remove with soap? Or some other option?

6224 2018-02-02 17:51:49 The group is comprised of company reps who sell snake oil to menopausal women.  If you take a look at the founder's (Gwen Harris) fb page you'll get that this site is about selling products and not about supporting women. Shame on GMA for sloppy vetting.

6280 2018-02-02 17:44:46 Whatever oil they help produce, is produced more efficiently with autonomous trucks and with less pollution. And the corporations that make the largest profits are not only oil companies (google? Apple?)
6281 2018-02-02 17:44:43 Just got my oil and air filter changed !
6282 2018-02-02 17:44:41 #BasEkAurSaal and phir ayegi modi sarkar! Admit it, modi govt has delivered like no other govt in 60 yrs.
Controlled inflation, oil prices, fight against terrorism, foreign policy, FDI, transparency, corruption free governance and much more!
6283 2018-02-02 17:44:36 What if you could get your oil changed at work so you can keep writing your paper
6284 2018-02-02 17:44:34 @RexTillersom of course when you say that they want the old venezuela was the one that sold them the oil at 4 dollars a barrel but that cock will no longer be a bastard son of a bitch
6285 2018-02-02 17:44:26 Both coconut and palm oil have saturated fats implicated in cardiovascular dz and as such the statement is to avoid. Other plant-based oils R mono and polyunsaturated types & cardioprotective. There is no clinical benefit of adding "oils" when eating #wholefood #plantbased.

6287 2018-02-02 17:44:15 Wages up. Dollar down. Goods prices up. Oil up. Food prices up. Gas prices up. Inflation on the rise. Buying Power stagnant. To reverse this effect we all need a stronger dollar.
6288 2018-02-02 17:44:10 @bengreenfield I want to give your "diet" a try.

Do you have a rough idea of the wild plants you're throwing into the blender with coco oil+superfoods for the smoothie breakfast?

6291 2018-02-02 17:43:31 What advice would you give to someone wanting to move up the ladder in the oil and gas world?
6292 2018-02-02 17:43:28 Part 7 the environmental damage costs of oil, coal not factored into price.  The military harm of gasoline not factored into price.  Ford Model T ran on biofuel and petroleum .
6293 2018-02-02 17:43:21 Speaking of BMWs, I got mine back from the shop yesterday. The dealer wanted $6,000 to fix my oil leaks.

1) I fixed two of them myself in about an hour. My cost: $50. The dealer wanted: $1300.
2) My indie mechanic fixed the major leak for $950. The dealer wanted $1300.

6295 2018-02-02 17:43:15 @dino_melaye i will recommend you deploy solar solutions, its cost effective. Now, my question is .... who will fuel the gen considering the uncertainty in the oil industry. I can go on and on with my questions. My senator, please DM me or let me have your email addy.

6298 2018-02-02 17:42:37 I go out for oyster crackers I end up spending $70, plus having to go get cases of hot wings, lottery tickets, oil change, spring rolls, and filling up the car.

6301 2018-02-02 17:41:52 I had a grandfather who unfortunately liked to make lamp conversions of stuff like antique vases or oil lamps.  The variety of things that fit into a tiny "real" HW store is astonishing if you're used to home improvement stores.
6302 2018-02-02 17:41:35 Part 6 takes into account harm from pollution over time.  IMF Externational: Prices Do Not Capture All Costs.  Pollution from oil, coal increases health care costs by trillions of dollars over time - children with asthma, seniors with heart lung, 2016 black lung soaring again
6303 2018-02-02 17:41:35 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
6304 2018-02-02 17:41:22 Wow  Brakes have wear tabs that will squeak. That's when they need to be replaced. No squeak no need for new brakes

Btw We're just a mobile oil change company that only changes your oil & filter. If you need anything else done we can just simply recommend shops we trust
6305 2018-02-02 17:41:19 Yea, because once we get finished eating Kinder Morgans lunch we're simply going to ignore dangerous expansion of oil by rail. Once we beat Kinder Morgan oil by rail is the next target, homie.
6306 2018-02-02 17:41:19 No. But I'm sore and woke up next to a bottle of baby oil??
6307 2018-02-02 17:41:10 No I wash my face with biore baking soda face wash then use coconut + tea tree oil as a moisturizer
6308 2018-02-02 17:41:09 Palm oil rice is still so underrated
6309 2018-02-02 17:40:56 Models who do glitter shows (!!!) how the heck do you do it? Coconut oil and glitter? I want to ~sparkle~ but not permanently.
6310 2018-02-02 17:40:45 I'm not a fan of coconut oil either.
6311 2018-02-02 17:40:42 Going back into deeper paint prehistory I identify two main epochs:

6312 2018-02-02 17:40:37 How did you not ask Pruitt about his conflicts of interest with the oil and gas industry? Everything he says is compromised by that
6313 2018-02-02 17:40:34 I am sore af, where is bae with the oil and hands
6314 2018-02-02 17:40:33 I feel so gorgeous today. I used a rose oil blend last night and this morning and it really made a difference in how my makeup applies
6315 2018-02-02 17:40:22 Bakken is a spent play ask Oasis.  Any of these article not referencing how many tier 1 locations are garbage.  Tier 2 is a third the oil.

6325 2018-02-02 17:38:48 I use coconut oil mixed with tea tree oil twice a day 
6326 2018-02-02 17:38:46 Well he’s giving me brand new everything filters and oil change so i guess . I paid 150 last time from someone else and still had to pay for parts
6327 2018-02-02 17:38:41 Why do you keep on adding oil to the fire
6328 2018-02-02 17:38:25 Today's pizza has crushed tomato, red onion, mozzarella and Valbreso feta cheese, garlic olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and cilantro

6333 2018-02-02 17:37:38 So my day was a little late starting.  But I'm getting CosmicQuandary's oil change done, then I'm renting her a copy of Overwatch for us to play later tonight.  Then I'm off to the house to start my stream extra early.  If I get affiliate before 4-1I'll easy my 1 chip challenge.

6338 2018-02-02 17:36:48 They didn't even bother to remove the olive oil?

6340 2018-02-02 17:36:27 @evandawson fossil fuels are only cheaper because we don't price in the health effects of pollution, the added cost of an outsize military to defend oil resources, the future loss of real estate value due to rising sea level, etc etc.  comparatively solar is extremely cheap
6341 2018-02-02 17:36:15 what oil do you recommend for acne scaring and/or texture improvement? @glossiers
6342 2018-02-02 17:36:13 They hoagies down here oil

6344 2018-02-02 17:36:07 Since you’re brunette cocoa powder is a good alternative as it’ll soak up the oil but not leave a white residue. Plus it smells nice lol. And yeah honestly just once a week and deep conditioning keeps it in check
6345 2018-02-02 17:35:49 Montoya has been in the league how long? I find it incredibly hard to believe that word had not spread around about it. I absolutely believe anyone covering the Oil would have called anyone they know that covers Mtl and asked about him.
6346 2018-02-02 17:35:13 Pull up to valvoline for an oil change and before the guy even says hi he goes you look stoned and if that wasn’t awkward he’s screaming stonner every time he walks by my car

6348 2018-02-02 17:35:04 Huge HT to @PhilippaDunne for  connecting the dots between the historical compression in workweek (offsets wage gains), weakening in diffusion indexes & weak temp employment. Outside of natural disasters and oil prices, there was little to write home about in this jobs report.

6356 2018-02-02 17:33:22 Big Pharma solutions are pretty much useless—really they only are motivated to get into your wallet and ensure you need their product forever: they have zero interest in providing a true cure. Try some CBD oil or smoke a joint
6357 2018-02-02 17:33:21 Right, forget our lumber, fishing, tourism, etc. I realize Alberta needs oil expansion to prosper and help Canada, however, the 94% of provincial land BC has deserves to not be intruded on by another.
6358 2018-02-02 17:33:21 find you another oil filter
6359 2018-02-02 17:33:13 And you guys forgot to help us with the car but it’s cool while you guys wash it and oil changes we’ll be out here building another car

6361 2018-02-02 17:33:05 I don't get how or why individuals own oil Lincence for profit, where states of the federation can't pay salaries. Fundamentally wrong in my opinion. Every state should own the wells-wealth. 

#Nigerian #wayforward #2019 #PIB
6362 2018-02-02 17:33:04 By washing it everyday you’re stripping it of its natural oils so it’s overcompensating by overproducing oil which is why it’s greasy after day one
6363 2018-02-02 17:33:00 Aye yo @arco what’s going on with you gas prices dawg. Y’all went from being the most responsible to the most expensive. Y’all going to make me go to US oil and all that weak stuff till y’all go down. Money don’t come out the ass you know 
6364 2018-02-02 17:32:57 What about a Mobile Oil change ?
6365 2018-02-02 17:32:33 #UKOG is aimed at English nationalists. Its appeal has little to do with immediate commercial rewards. All that's important is the dream of England being self-sufficient in oil. Facts don't matter.
6366 2018-02-02 17:32:32 The rest of my body? I used avocado oil on the whole thing 
6367 2018-02-02 17:32:32 Alaskans own 387,091 shares of WPX ENERGY INC, worth $5,183,148. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
6368 2018-02-02 17:32:29 Geraldo repeat..... hype and snake oil
6369 2018-02-02 17:32:20 So another day, and prices at the pump are $1.475 per litre. Whats the ridiculous excuse this time @GasBuddy @CKNW @NEWS1130 dollar is up, price of oil is down? Why can’t a single journalist dig deeper into this collusive monopoly?!? Punitive mobility pricing is already here.
6370 2018-02-02 17:32:13 Bahaha I didn't even realize ole floppy ears was taking salmon oil!!

6374 2018-02-02 17:31:43 How is it all the naysayers forget we are a long way from total green energy. And the fact that Alberta and it’s oil are the economic engine that drives this country making all Canadians have a higher standard of living
6375 2018-02-02 17:31:38 @Boilerjuice not received my oil today even though I paid extra for it to be delivered today! Can you tell me where it is?? I’ve tried to call but on hold for over ten minutes!
6376 2018-02-02 17:31:31 Been away for he afternoon, come back and #I3E has had yet another stormer. Good top up this morning. #ECHO my other oil play slowly regaining ground. Have a good weekend everyone.

6383 2018-02-02 17:30:29 It's snake oil. On the surface is sounds great, then you get in to the detail and realize there is nothing that addresses the root problems of the immigration process, or the issues plaguing the border patrol agency.
6384 2018-02-02 17:30:17 @VW Love your cars - just ordered an ‘18 Tiguan and already have a ‘13 Beetle convertible. However, your dealer in Downtown Chicago is SHADY and has deceptive business practices. I did not work with them - but will NEVER - wont even take my car there for an oil change.
6385 2018-02-02 17:30:12 I just came back from the pharmacy they only had tea tree oil for external use only, I'll order some from Holland and Barrett's.
6386 2018-02-02 17:30:09 As I’m sure you know, we auctioned off 19 deep water oil blocks in the Gulf this past Wednesday.
6387 2018-02-02 17:30:05 ... currently listening to @WenonahHauter on @wnyc. extremely interesting, about using oil wastewater to irrigate crops in Central Valley. A reminder of how water-intensive fuel extraction often is (in nuclear, oil, fracking, and so on).

-pan fry chicken strips in olive oil. Season with salt, pepper and chillier flakes. 
-chop bacon into bits and fry as well. 
-sauté mushrooms in butter and season with salt & pepper.
6394 2018-02-02 17:29:21 I hate how much places charge for an oil change.
6395 2018-02-02 17:29:17 We can’t allow one province to control what another can sell. It would have been better to cap oil sands production to reduce emissions, not use pipeline as a proxy. But, given fed/prov power balance…
6396 2018-02-02 17:29:08 "Hi sir I just got my oil changed there 15 minutes ago and you said you checked and fixed my tire pressure but the warning light is still on"

"..... ok thanks for your help bye"
6397 2018-02-02 17:28:57 I eat a 100ml edibles every day. The pain relief I get from vaping is almost instant. I may have to eat more instead of just 1 a day. I took a BIG dab of oil before this started.

6401 2018-02-02 17:28:32 You should really write a piece about the oil industry in Scotland. You know more about it than anyone I know.
6402 2018-02-02 17:28:23  T-Rex is talking too much. And his pickets are full of Oil money=Europe don't care about about T-Rex.(Tilerson)=
6403 2018-02-02 17:28:17 Absolutely and even let them keep their Barnett. Let’s see how they get on without all our exports ( which don’t tally as they leave English ports) I.e whisky, oil, fish etc .. I think that’s sounds fair..

6407 2018-02-02 17:27:39 One of the best Redacteds I've watched ever -- both your convo w/Lee and the segment on the NY Times, oil and climate.
6408 2018-02-02 17:27:33 Well believe it or not whether you're talking safety or tree hugging the answer it the same. Only way it won't happen is of it doesn't get shipped. Won't get shipped it out don't need it. So as I said, better return all oil products, Phone included!

6418 2018-02-02 17:26:11 mineral oil is terrible unless you have chronic eczema in which case it's the only thing that keeps you from looking like quazimodo (personal experience speaking here.)

Me- hi, wanted to schedule an oil change for tomorrow if possible.

Lady- oh okay yeah we usually don’t take any drop-offs.

“My brain- Pendeja thats why im calling”
6422 2018-02-02 17:25:31 What happens when these oil spills are in the oceans where no one can see? Where are the Enviros and their Anti oil protesters?
6423 2018-02-02 17:25:25 @BillGates  I’m not sure you are aware of this or not, but FYI, there is an add for CBD oil using your name and Twitter account that is a fraud. My wife ordered some for her disorder and was charged $80 for a free trial and then treated rudely when trying to cancel it. Ripoff.

6429 2018-02-02 17:24:42 Perhaps they are headed to the equity markets where shorts seem to be having plenty of luck this past month.  It's almost like an inverse relationship to oil prices (oil up, energy equities go down!)

6431 2018-02-02 17:24:07 .@JustinTrudeau science is clear that 1.5C-2C is catastrophic for our kids future.

Y don't you accept the #climate emergency, acting rationally?

Why aren't you pushing for carbon free jobs rather than fossil fuel ones of AB oil & BC gas?

6435 2018-02-02 17:23:30 I’ve always found that when we ask a customer if they would buy brand new car, would they drain all the old oil from their old and and put it in the new car? They say no! Then the flush has been accepted lol. Or put a boiler with short warranty! They won’t repair it if it’s dirty

6439 2018-02-02 17:23:10 I used African Pride Shea Miracle line & used their leave in conditioner + bouncy curls pudding. I also used this other small sample I got from an event along with a little Argan oil + eco styler olive oil gel. I’ll take pics of the products when I get home.

6446 2018-02-02 17:22:06 It really is admin  but once the hair is plaited, you get a break.

Yes, avocado oil is a very good oil. I use mainly that and a little bit of other oils I have - coconut, olive - and essential oils (rosemary, tea tree - these help nourish the scalp)
6447 2018-02-02 17:22:03 The vast majority of waste water disposed of each year is from oil/gas production, not leftover from the frac
6448 2018-02-02 17:22:02 Vitamin E oil got my eyebrows flourishing.
6449 2018-02-02 17:22:01 Yes, lower demand for gas during economic slowing leads to lower gas prices.

More, Obama luckily presided over the shale boom on privately-owned land. This led to increased domestic oil production (despite decreased govt-land oil production bc of Obama’s onerous green policies).
6450 2018-02-02 17:21:55 Was a revelation when I learnt to heat up the oil/crude oil-like soy sauce ones before you open em.

6461 2018-02-02 17:20:24 Yup, when I was at Lush, they would explain that most people with acne are making their skin worse with the stuff marketed to them. When you strip your skin of oil with astringents, you body then produces MOAR oil to compensate - which creates more acne.
6462 2018-02-02 17:20:10 This seems a bit surprising.
I thought the brain functions better with certain types of fat, and that coconut oil was among them.

6465 2018-02-02 17:19:59 No its not all going swimmingly and in my recollection rarely has but it is going about as well as it can and to expect otherwise is pie in the sky. A very few countries run a surplus, Norway, Singapore, Germany and the oil states but for the rest of us this is how life us.

6479 2018-02-02 17:18:41 I do so far. They have some with coconut oil though that I don’t like. But the one I’m using now is just chia seed oil and my face seems to like it!

6490 2018-02-02 17:17:29 Nigeria is a very foolish country. Nothing explains a refinery not being cited at Akwa Ibom state.

6493 2018-02-02 17:16:59 Don't forget to also boycott Ontario wines, poutine, and maple syrup.  Ontario and Quebec don't want an energy east pipeline which would allow Alberta oil to be refined on the east coast instead of the Middle East oil we currently import.

6500 2018-02-02 17:15:50 Where will they get the crude oil to refine? 
From the South of course!
So they are gonna spend more money constructing more pipelines to transport crude up North when we have 2 refineries in the South. SMH
This govt is a complete failure.

6503 2018-02-02 17:15:29 Their drones still think the oil brings in loads of money.  The SNP doesn’t disabuse them because it suits it. It all seems to be about Brexit now - everything they say applies in spades to the prospect of Scotland leaving the UK

6515 2018-02-02 17:14:39 We’ll agree to disagree then.  Mexico has a state run oil industry with an atrocious safety record.  Their 1979 spill in the Gulf is still among the largest ever (including when Sadam set fire to Kuwaiti oil fields).Profit is not a dirty word. I go to work b/c I expect to profit.

6532 2018-02-02 17:12:43 I agree. The main determinant is the crude oil price. But surely local refining will provide logistical efficiencies that will ultimately reflect in pump prices.

6537 2018-02-02 17:12:08 Why are these politicians giving permits for pipelines to be dug? And assuming the gas pipelines are unbreakable just like they assumed with oil pipelines in the ocean. How are they going to dig up gas in the soil when it break and prevent getting into water?

6552 2018-02-02 17:10:46 So sad. Evanka did a great wall, and nobody can compete with that country? Trade has big benefits, and I take the oil. Boeing’s secrets.
6553 2018-02-02 17:10:45 I’ve been using the AHA peel. The best way I can describe it is I’ve always been super oily and now I’m not oily anymore. I mean zero oil! I love it.

6558 2018-02-02 17:10:15 So far a nice week trading $NG and $ES.  Now if I can just get OIL/GOLD to start heading further south icing on the cake.

Dogs are precious pets. Most people normally prefer keeping them for companion purposes. I
6561 2018-02-02 17:09:47 Decided I’m buying a diffuser for every room in my house. Just gotta decided on essential oil scents-I’m ready for some new scents 
6562 2018-02-02 17:09:33 I love the Daily, but I wish you would've had a more substantial rebuttal. The enviro writer just rehashed Pruitt's positions, & since he wasnt asked about his relationships with oil & gas companies, it's just another opportunity for him to spread his anti environmental message.
6563 2018-02-02 17:09:26 @StateDept rectify the mess in your government you shitholes. We know you are salivating for our OIL
6564 2018-02-02 17:09:22 CA:  Twoworkers killed in oil and gas well explosion.
6565 2018-02-02 17:09:13 It's 12 in the afternoon and Juan and I are walking around NY with four lokos and our oil pen lmfao

6567 2018-02-02 17:08:20 Bratwurst cooked without oil. With us possible....#London
6568 2018-02-02 17:08:20 Loser pts plus special teams are probably solely responsible for Oil being out of playoff spot right now.  Meaning even with poor goalie start, injuries & some slovenly games it's good enough roster, never mind if goal & injuries settle.  Shit yr but no need to panic for next yr.
6569 2018-02-02 17:08:12 Lash extensions are all fun and games until you take them off and you have no lashes. Now you’re stuck using caster oil every night. 
6570 2018-02-02 17:07:20 I don't know you seemed to manage making mac and cheese with olive oil once, I assumed you could pull off another culinary miracle???
6571 2018-02-02 17:07:05 Question about all of the forthcoming Permian production misses “due to cold-weather”. Does cold weather actually impact existing oil production? I know it can cause freeze offs and downtime during D&C, thus deferring new production until next Q, etc. @RobertClarke_WM @RTDukes
6572 2018-02-02 17:06:33 Another question. Is it not funny to be sighting a refinery so far from the raw materials to be refined?  ie Crude Oil. 
Why take the jobs and spin -offs to the north where they are no deposits?
6573 2018-02-02 17:06:33 Sending my condolences and thoughts to @AdamLarsson3 and his entire family today. All of Oil country is behind you 
6574 2018-02-02 17:06:32 I have had the opportunity & pleasure 2 work for a crude oil reserve company in SA. DEA & WCG has a long way 2 go...as LONG the pipes that transport gas and crude oil from 1 region to onother. Pride defeats US AS A NATION ALL THE TIME.
6575 2018-02-02 17:06:29 short of military coup...oil workers' strikes..." another example: MeanTimeToRepair for major failures (pipes and pumps) at Vzla.s East coast export facilities are in excess of 1 year. Exports out of those terminals would be 0 in that interval.
6576 2018-02-02 17:06:16 Exactly.
 All political parties are same. If Congress gets in to power they will do corruption and anti people things as they done in last term. Like giving oil companies the right to fix oil price etc
6577 2018-02-02 17:06:10 Oil changes are annoying
6578 2018-02-02 17:05:47 nice chart Anas. goes for the other oil dependent economies like Russia.
6579 2018-02-02 17:05:46 One of my favs..  Packaging/bottles direct to dispensary/grower and they acquired an canna oil company..  solid company.. been in them since $2.50, not a bad place to add if you're long term with them
6580 2018-02-02 17:05:42 open your eyes and see the deceit ... the oil and gas industry get massive subsidies and the public is often on the hook for cleanup costs due to spills as well to the tune of 700 BILLION in subsidies in the US alone ... subsidies to electric car manufacturers is a tiny fraction
6581 2018-02-02 17:05:19 Imperial Oil posts $137M loss in 4th quarter
6582 2018-02-02 17:05:03 short of military coup...oil workers' strikes..." another example: lack of diluent for the Orinoco Belt (numerous reasons could trigger that one) = 0 production out of it.
6583 2018-02-02 17:05:02 Big new oil finds, deep depression in the unionist ranks, how do they spin this as disaster?
6584 2018-02-02 17:04:55 As it stands there are only two ways forward for VNZ.  Overthrow the government and replace it with one the US will drop sanctions for, or two, overthrow the government and replace it with one the Russians will support , in exchange for their oil assets.  Frying pan or fire?
6585 2018-02-02 17:04:28 Fine for formal numbers but I'm asking for 'guidance' to emphasise how you see the impact into the first half of 2018 numbers of $60-plus oil. Holders & market needs something to crunch, hence 'guidance'. Many do it if good or bad...
6586 2018-02-02 17:04:09 I wanna die I can't get my laptop fixed I can't get my oil changed what am I supposed to do
6587 2018-02-02 17:04:08 "Oil can"
6588 2018-02-02 17:04:02 Drove around listening to Fall out Boys "From Under the Cork Tree" and had a few "teenage flashbacks" to when boys were my biggest problem. Now I have to pay oil and feed myself.

6593 2018-02-02 17:03:36 Huffing some lavender oil. If I had lavender buds, I would make a London Fog.
6594 2018-02-02 17:03:13 short of military coup...oil workers' strikes..."You are leaving out many critical factors that could produce that result. Hardware failures to name one. The pipes at East coast main terminal are over 10 years overdue life expectancy. Already had a major leak...

6598 2018-02-02 17:02:43 Just scraped my glass palette so clean that it’s literally glistening, now unwrapping some spanking new Rosemary brushes...I’m encapsulated by the scent of fresh oil paint, and....a bunch of heart-eyes emojis just materialized above my head?? 
6599 2018-02-02 17:02:32 I love the Goldfinger throw back scene! What an oil bath! #007
6600 2018-02-02 17:02:27 Been up for two and half hours. Ate some lunch gave the makeup brushes a much needed shampoo and conditioner. My own hair is next with an oil treatment for the dry ends. Should be able to a daytime show today. Yay!!!

6602 2018-02-02 17:02:04 It tasted like someone spit their fruity gum in it and let it sit there for 13 hours and then dropped some essential oil in just for an extra kick on your taste buds
6603 2018-02-02 17:02:02 There is a slight difference between waffle syrup and pancake syrup. Much like used motor oil, you’ll know it when you taste it.

6609 2018-02-02 17:01:44 So advocating there be 100% proper safe gaurds in place and the responisibility of clean up clearly defined in the inevitible case of your poison spilling all over our beautiful province and coastline is treating you unfairly. Cry me a river of spilled oil in your own backyard.
6610 2018-02-02 17:01:28 If the breakout hasn't been popped and there's no injury, you can dab some apple cider vinegar on it or tea tree oil too. Both work well, tea tree oil is effective.
6611 2018-02-02 17:01:25 I bought some cedarwood essential oil to try in my diffuser, cause, hey, who doesn't like the smell of cedarwood? Have you ever smelled cat urine that has gone bad? Real bad? That's what I ended up with. Please heed my warning and stay away. For your own safety and sanity.

6644 2018-02-02 16:57:53 does tea tree oil berangin???
6645 2018-02-02 16:57:25 Is it an oil defused or a humidifier?

6688 2018-02-02 16:53:02 "Data is essentially the new oil, and the CDO is beginning to be recognized as the linchpin for tackling one of the most important problems in enterprises today: driving value from data." Langley Eide, chief strategy officer of self-service data analytics specialist Alteryx
6689 2018-02-04 23:59:57 1 of my patients found it weird that I had a backpack with store brought soap, lotion, Aquaphor healing cream, perfume, cologne, hair spray, hair oil, mousse, a comb, a brush, scrunchies, shaving cream, and after shave. He said "She's not in #Chicago anymore. We don't need that"
6690 2018-02-04 23:59:53 Go overseas, kill innocent people, and secure new oil contracts for multinational corporations. Whats not to love about being a #USMC
6691 2018-02-04 23:59:40 I've not gotten the oil pastels out once for this project and that's really sad? need to start gettin messy again
6692 2018-02-04 23:59:32 u should try !!! eucalyptus oil w steam inhalation my nose is always blocked but when I used to do that it was actually pretty ok most of the time
6693 2018-02-04 23:59:30 I hope I win. I need a new car to get to work and school since my current one is leaking oil and can’t afford to fix it
6694 2018-02-04 23:59:02 I definitely think so! When I have the oil,  I put it on some cookies 
6695 2018-02-04 23:58:50 eliminated salad dressings ,use very little oil, just for sautéing,  not much. I work 10 hour+ shifts at Cleveland Clinic as a nurse. I walk a lot,  have been walking after work 30 min. Also on my off days, but I will walk twice on off days
6696 2018-02-04 23:58:26 See how this baba is trying to tarnish my hopes ! Allow me with my castor oil in peace .. I have faith , why can’t I unread this 
6697 2018-02-04 23:58:21 Misrepresentation might also be open to interpretation. The data sheet, though informative, doesn't really provide the guidance around 'here's where we will be by this date on Palm Oil'

Here's another question - 'Why Palm Oil?'
6698 2018-02-04 23:57:43 My point is that LPs are selling CBD oil for insane amounts, and making projections based on these amounts. hemp farmers will destroy those margins.  "unique formulations", is bs hype talk. The carrier oil isn't the magic, the CBD is.

6729 2018-02-04 23:55:32 well evidently according to a top CS they're got "impartial"&"unbiased" written right through them it's just the brexit "snake oil salesmen" who don't want them looking at what they're selling,he said without even a hint of irony lol

6745 2018-02-04 23:51:59 I made steak fajitas cooked in  an oil mixture with hidden valley ranch powder (I know it kinda sounds weird but it's really good) and she made fettuccini Alfredo with garlic bread tonight.

6758 2018-02-04 23:50:49 :eye roll: the formula is irrelevant, the CBD is the magic.  Selling "patented" sunflower oil with CBD for $30,000 when it's worth $1000 is the crime.  LPs thinking they will make bank from CBD oil are only fooling themselves (and their clueless investors of course).

let's get real uranium won't run out soon like oil and gas and it's much more stable than natural energy, all things considered, it's reasonable to use uranium.
we must point out you need some specific type of uranium to fuel nuclear power plant, as far as those goes,

6773 2018-02-04 23:48:47 The ~$30 heavy oil discount is a subsidy from Canadians to American users. We are losing an opportunity worth, literally, tens of millions of dollars per day. Or look at it as we are giving Americans a huge discount on each bbl sold.
6774 2018-02-04 23:48:45 We live in a city where they have to put gear oil on the light poles if that's not the most badass thing ever Idk what is

6778 2018-02-04 23:47:56 My doctor said to put the oil (I use baby oil) in before your shower so it gets warm and softens the wax

6783 2018-02-04 23:47:14 Hell yeah did my oil change under 30 mins.
6784 2018-02-04 23:47:14 Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, Brazil - all failed socialist oil states.  So why in hell does trump want to emulate them?
6785 2018-02-04 23:47:11 Wow Dr Oz out here with Celsius like the snake oil salesman he is
6786 2018-02-04 23:47:11 Who thought using Doctor Oz was a good choice for their commercial? Dude is a snake oil salesmen
6787 2018-02-04 23:47:10 Imagine the politicians that makes those bills worthless are those who are creating #petro backed in oil barrels that haven't been produced yet. So still no intrinsic value there. It is only confidence

6798 2018-02-04 23:46:31 What horses crave and desperately need is coconut oil, dontcha know?
6799 2018-02-04 23:46:21 OMG, You should try mojo pork. In a crockpot, throw in a pork shoulder - 2-3 lbs. then add mojo sauce. 

Mojo sauce: 
Bring 1/3c olive oil to boil. Add 8 cloves garlic, diced. When fragrant, take off heat. add 2/3 citrus juice - I like either fresh orange or pineapple. Season.
6800 2018-02-04 23:46:14 Fuck you, snake oil salesman
6801 2018-02-04 23:46:09 I've got to pace myself, have only one beer in the house (but it's a Foster's "oil can")

6806 2018-02-04 23:45:47 For what, exactly? This isn't really McCarthy Era, Cold War is over, Soviet state collapsed in 1990s. More concerned about ties with China and the oil countries.
6807 2018-02-04 23:45:42 Aye, certainly in the north east it is like that. Folk here never happier than when moaning especially the older generation. Got into a row with a pensioner in Stonehaven a few years back. He was adamant our oil was not our oil. I asked him who owned saudi oil... Hard work...

6816 2018-02-04 23:44:23 Breaking through the wholesale belief that “cannabis oil/products” are based on small scale “hippy” remedies will take an awful lot of counter marketing, yet the business has had £200K of spending.

6822 2018-02-04 23:43:55 The companies disposing of waste water using disposal wells in areas with active faults are to blame for triggering the Oklahoma earthquakes earlier than they otherwise would have occurred. The oil industry didn't cause stress on the faults. Just released it earlier.

6828 2018-02-04 23:43:06 So just wondering, how are they planning to clean that crap off the poles!  Every time you bump into a pole you’re going to get oil on your clothes...
6829 2018-02-04 23:42:47 ngl. all these ksoo rub head with oil jokes want me to actually rub my head with oil now
6830 2018-02-04 23:42:42 It's funny to remember when Man City were just also rans stuck in a lower division. Then Middle East oil money stepped in...
6831 2018-02-04 23:42:31 Tess, try the Clinique acne solutions oil control cleansing mask! It has a 1% of salicylic in it!
6832 2018-02-04 23:42:21 It’s a trash sandwich. Italian sub with extra oil and vinegar + oregano is much more delicious and simple. The Fake News Mainstream Media has sold you a lie
6833 2018-02-04 23:42:06 The canola oil makes it
6834 2018-02-04 23:42:05 @ChiefPerm What’s up with Belichik? Is he dressed to coach or to change the oil in his car? #SuperBowlLII
6835 2018-02-04 23:41:42 I would much rather have my pain medication but am trying full spectrum CBD oil made from hemp.  I don’t know what else to do until they realize that us chronic pain patients aren’t the problem.
6836 2018-02-04 23:41:36 Soooooo Kylie squeezed out another spawn of Satan, cool. I was going to give a fuck but ummm I'd rather dip my balls in boiling oil.
6837 2018-02-04 23:41:23 Yes, zero capital project! Did not default in what? 

Oil price had little or nothing to do with recession! It was the poor economic team he assembled. There’s a reason the ECA was created. But instead, Baba spent $3b from there trying to find oil in the north, eyeing another 1b
6838 2018-02-04 23:41:17 #Benin - Oil Tanker carrying 13500 tons refined petroleum products and crew 22 #India nationals reported missing off Benin coast
6839 2018-02-04 23:41:06 I know. I spent a lot of time looking at rundown East German oil and gas facilities. It's estimated that Germany spent more on regeneration and integration than the EU on the last financial crash. It's still not the same as absorbing 16m people.

6842 2018-02-04 23:40:51 Have you tried rubbing a drop of lavender oil on the bottoms of your feet and diffusing it in your bedroom?
6843 2018-02-04 23:40:42 True. But NEW oil sands require $80+ for decades to justify investing billions. US Shale now de facto swing supplier very quick to react with breakeven of $50 getting lower, Saudis concluded their oil will be stranded, hence defending market share, no room for high cost producers
6844 2018-02-04 23:40:40 Thankful that I can come home and my dad will change my oil for me 
6845 2018-02-04 23:40:30 The Ol hydraulic oil trick!!
6846 2018-02-04 23:40:29 Nope, they invaded North Africa because they need natural resources ( iran, silver, copper, gas, oil...etc). that's the main reason.

6849 2018-02-04 23:40:04 Hot coconut oil on the scalp and massaging it in, is actually a blessin.
6850 2018-02-04 23:40:00 He's great for getting people doing it for themselves. His recipes are cut back and achievable. Both his 30 minute and 15 minute meal books are great. Although he needs to calm the fuck down with the olive oil usage.

6852 2018-02-04 23:39:54 After @AshleyEmmax did such an amazing oil show last night, I think we all agree that it's the turn of @Amberjade_uk tonight!! Eh @BabestationTV ?

6854 2018-02-04 23:39:36 Is that the guy from Midnight Oil? 
6855 2018-02-04 23:39:36 They're the ones that set that release clause, and another oil rich tean paid it, it is the reason transfers are insane now, but you can't blame the man himself
6856 2018-02-04 23:39:33 hope those Dubai oil barons will invest a few million in AMLH.
6857 2018-02-04 23:39:32 Venezuelan oil is cheaper than Russianil as Russian oil is harder to extract.  before sanctions, Exxon was going to drill, Exxon = Tillerson
6858 2018-02-04 23:39:30 I've got a bunch on my arms from grabbing my sisters cat while he was having a panic attack and trying to kill the other cats he had to be pried off by two people and some from tripping and spilling hot cooking oil on my right arm lmao
6859 2018-02-04 23:39:24 If anyone knows anything about the energy business is that #Russia rules oil and gas in their country. You can not do energy business without the blessing of the govt. it’s not criminal just business as usual.

6866 2018-02-04 23:39:00 It's Brexit that is the snake oil. It's fake and not going to deliver on most of what it promises. Hence snake oil.
6867 2018-02-04 23:38:40 Superbowl Sunday. The one day of the year that the whole of America takes a break from stealing other countries oil and shooting schoolchildren to sit down and watch a convoluted version of rugby with a pop concert in the middle.

6870 2018-02-04 23:37:53 Before they are actually ripe you can slice them, roll them in panko and fry them in hot oil.
Use them for tacos, sandwiches, or just eat them. They are fantastic.
6871 2018-02-04 23:37:53 Yeah, still not provincial jurisdiction. He can ask till he's blue in the face, he just can't stop shipments while the review is taking place. Not on. Also, take a moment to think about the hundreds of thousands of Albertans employed in oil and gas. You know, your neighbours.
6872 2018-02-04 23:37:43 Considering Houston being largely oil and gas business any indication Houston would get by May 2018?
6873 2018-02-04 23:37:29 How can we link “ the ball had a leak  “ with “ our chain of oil change locations ” and get 1,300 Social media execs to retweet it to each other and it to reach nobody who matters ?
6874 2018-02-04 23:37:29 We had glass milk bottles delivered on an electric milk van in the 1970's and we were miles away from the dairy. Obviously oil was too cheap then

6883 2018-02-04 23:36:03 Put a little oregano oil on his chest it will clear up the flu and prevent measles ! #fuckbigpharma
6884 2018-02-04 23:35:54 Just asking to make sure you have completely eliminated oil and are at least walking twice a day.
6885 2018-02-04 23:35:45 The collab I’d give anything to see. I hope olive oil comes too. Popeye can taste popeye chicken then arm wrestle Rhett and Link. A+ content.
6886 2018-02-04 23:35:33 Even Turks supported Gulen. Erdogan broke the cease fire agreement and started assaulting Kurds. Turks support syrian rebels (& sometimes ISIS arabs as well). Who purchased ISIS oil, I hope it was not Erdogan's son.I didnt say US is sage, west,arabs&turks colluded 2 destroy syria

6889 2018-02-04 23:34:50 Vitamin E oil
6890 2018-02-04 23:34:34 Zero capital projects?... Can we also reflect on how Nigeria did not default with 26usd per barrel and little savings? 
Recession?... Is the economy not tied to oil?.. Or does Buhari control global oil price?
6891 2018-02-04 23:34:34 They should have used vegetable oil or something similar...not a petroleum based product.
6892 2018-02-04 23:34:28 Massaged kale, roasted cashews, Asian pears and lemon juice with olive oil and salt/pepper is my favorite
6893 2018-02-04 23:34:15 my boyfriends dad is such a dad to me  like he makes sure my oil is good and he topped off my coolant and wiper fluid like wow  i’m so blessed
6894 2018-02-04 23:34:00 No, they will not. There is no doubting my mind that once we start to undo the legislations they have put in place to oppress everyone, their bombs will start dropping here. It's how oligarchy operates. 

Syria protested oil pipelines once... And look at what we have done to them
6895 2018-02-04 23:33:49 One gallon of used motor oil can ruin approximately one million gallons of fresh water!
6896 2018-02-04 23:33:24 the Republican Party +Trump want to please the robber barons of oil and gas with a proposal to cut 72% of the clean energy research. It is going to be years and years before we can clean up the damage from the Republican Party as currently constituted and its standardbearer Trump

6900 2018-02-04 23:32:46 If the National Theatre took the Cheviot, the Stag, and the Black Black Oil on a tour of every theatre, civic centre, school, church hall, etc for six month leading up to indyref2, there would be no doubt about the outcome (especially with the actors' delightful wee adlibs)
6901 2018-02-04 23:32:14 Good luck 5j!
6902 2018-02-04 23:31:53 It's just whipped oil and fake sweetener. How is that healthier than a scoop of actual ice cream?

6911 2018-02-04 23:30:30 Great quote from @Gus_ODonnell “If your selling snake oil, you don’t like the experts and testing your product.” So looking at u @Jacob_Rees_Mogg remember that organisations like the @OBR_UK were created so politicians like yourself don’t distort economic facts. #TreasuryGate

6922 2018-02-04 23:28:42 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
6923 2018-02-04 23:28:38 No. You have a political problem in BC. It’s called obstinacy and hypocrisy. Y’all drive cars, fly and use oil - but you won’t let Alberta get it to tidewater. Fix that and we might listen to you. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #abpoli
6924 2018-02-04 23:28:30 If the recipe doesnt start out oil/butter, onions, pepper, garlic (& in that order), I’m already side-eyeing it.

6949 2018-02-04 23:25:22 Early 1800s scientists shot & stuffed ~15 Great Auks. Millions boiled down for oil. Oil burnt, but specimens in museums remain & may even help resurrect the species in future. Indignation at the extinction is directed at both parties almost equally. That's not right, is it?

6971 2018-02-04 23:21:53 Funny, how if "Putin wins," Trump is breaking the Russian oil industry with new American energy dominance.

7126 2018-02-04 22:57:46 Also, I bet that's good for the environment...... oil just running down the streets. What a bunch of losers who half to act out so much because they're life didn't amount to anything, that they think they're part of that team or had anything to do with them.
7127 2018-02-04 22:57:30 Everybody want a car til you gotta pay the insurance, get an oil change, fill the tank up, get new parts, and also get all the other unnecessary shit mechanics over exaggerate is wrong with the car.
7128 2018-02-04 22:57:29 I didn't sell everything. Just took some off the top. Also I've been long oil & soft commodities for a while.
7129 2018-02-04 22:57:29 we know, we see all of them, sad part is many will get the fake ones from TV or find some recipe that really does them all wrong... The only oil in them should be cocoa butter, anything else is swizzle..
7130 2018-02-04 22:57:26 just used vaporub for the first time in years n now a smell like hoof oil in an old mouldy tack room, where the FUCK did the minty smell go
7131 2018-02-04 22:57:19 Shoutout to castor oil seriously, there’s hairs on places of my face I thought would never come I feel like crying 
7132 2018-02-04 22:57:12 More people die of chemo than the cancer itself.  You can look that fact up.  I have been studying this stuff the past decade.  Also look into and CBD oil.
7133 2018-02-04 22:57:11 "Cuenta que en 2017 la producción de petróleo quedó por debajo de la de 1980 y que la de shale oil todavía no llega ni al 9% del total. [...]la extracción de petróleo en baja y la de gas estancada representan una parva de dólares en importaciones." Alcadio Oña.-
7134 2018-02-04 22:57:02 Forgot to mention, @calpizzakitchen has a certified #glutenfree kitchen and will even bring you plain pizza crust with oil and spices before your meal.
7135 2018-02-04 22:57:01 The good part it looks realistic. Like using oil paint
7136 2018-02-04 22:56:23 Received a poorly lit, painfully loud snap from Francis, who tells me between sobs he's at the bottom of an oil reserve about to have his dick drilled off!
7137 2018-02-04 22:56:19 Keep in mind that most "corporations" are small incorporated businesses . That's what people forget . Not every corporation  is amazon or big oil . Most are small businesses .
7138 2018-02-04 22:56:18 There is nothing like “too much coconut oil” when it comes to my skin.
.
It soaks up oil in a minute 
7139 2018-02-04 22:55:59 in trying to implement things before they're established, I make things so much harder on myself
7140 2018-02-04 22:55:45 The only thing bogus was your time at DOJ.  Stop trying to sell the snake oil.
7141 2018-02-04 22:55:42 It's not wages that's causing stock downturn, dollar collapse, oil price rise, & interest rate increase.
7142 2018-02-04 22:55:39 Don't know why i stopped using coconut oil in my hair for so long, my hair hasn't felt this soft in at least a year!
7143 2018-02-04 22:55:33 selling the rest of my cbd oil stock, get with me for an awesome price.
7144 2018-02-04 22:55:27 oil
7145 2018-02-04 22:55:12 Honestly my favorite dressing is just homemade olive oil+vinegar+salt and pepper, it's super basic but gives it just enough flavor and doesn't weigh it down, also very easy to make!

Oil is STILL on Valdez, AZ shore rocks from EXXON SPILL, decades later
7147 2018-02-04 22:55:03 Hydraulic oil smells horrible, so it will make it smell better there.
7148 2018-02-04 22:54:49 You tell um Ed, the current administration  wants to take us back to the dark ages so the oil/coal guys can squeeze out a few more trillions, with our environment and health paying the price.
7149 2018-02-04 22:54:38 Britain's greed for cheap oil saw them arm Nigeria and support a blockade against Biafra which staved men,women children to death.
7150 2018-02-04 22:54:28 Never claimed veganism is going to “save” us. But you can not deny the fact that if we stopped using oil, electricity, gas, etc we’d still exceed our carbon equivalent GHG emissions of 565 GT by 2030 if we continue to produce livestock the way we do today.
7151 2018-02-04 22:54:13 najelepij kup oliwke dla dzieci albo bio oil i samruj rano i wieczorem te czerwone nie znikną od razu, ale po jakimś czasie na pewno
7152 2018-02-04 22:53:59 That's what happened to me during the oil price crash. Smh

7154 2018-02-04 22:53:45 Con lo que cuesta la luz en este país, van a tener que poner unos buenos pesos. Y si es con generador a gas oil, ni te cuento. En la región, curiosamente, es bastante más barata.
7155 2018-02-04 22:53:43 Fear not.  Orange Jello promised billions in infrastructure money - to pay for the oil pipelines.
7156 2018-02-04 22:53:15 Anyone not eagerly awaiting word that Brady's sub par first half is due to Giardia-based diarrhea brought on by drinking Raw Water with his snake oil salesmen trainer?

7159 2018-02-04 22:52:48 Best suggestion I have is to check your vitamin and testosterone levels as well. That's typically the cause of thin beards. A good beard oil will help as will derma or menoxidil.
7160 2018-02-04 22:52:34 Ha! I’m young ... I strip pipe all the time. Wait... strip trip? 
7161 2018-02-04 22:52:31 Wait for much longer than you think you'd have to wait. They should be almost all black, and then you just fry em in hot oil (as one does when frying things) and I put them on a paper towel-lined plate while I cook (as one does for all things fried).
7162 2018-02-04 22:52:25 All the Sultanas I've seen in UK Supermarkets have Cotton Seed Oil added to them too.

7167 2018-02-04 22:51:54 $TEP stockholders love this. In a time of growing domestic oil and gas supply & lowered imports, TEP has the distribution network in place.

7176 2018-02-04 22:50:20 Why exactly is it a huge mistake? He’s saying Brexiteers are snake oil salesman and Whitehall are the experts. How is that fuelling suspicion?
7177 2018-02-04 22:50:07 Awesome! I wish you the best.
7178 2018-02-04 22:50:05 Not betting against him & I'm hardly an oil bull (I've been called a perma-bear as recently as a few months ago). I'm just trying to understand Joe's thought process. I'm a scientist not a trader. If you expect a certain price, CI tells you how much inventory you add/subtract.
7179 2018-02-04 22:49:59 Bought a new cool air humidifier off Amazon. It doubles as an essential oils diffuser. I didn’t know I needed this. Tip: One drop lemon, orange, and eucalyptus oils in 10oz of water is good for the sinuses. Also peppermint oil.

7182 2018-02-04 22:49:47 I’ve got so much beard oil in right now that there’s a Pizza Hut serving the local postcode from my jaw.
7183 2018-02-04 22:49:40 It's the frying bit that always trips people up. Oil too hot, oil too cold. There's a sweet spot.

Damn, now I want some wings.
7184 2018-02-04 22:49:25 Gee...let's hope this is biodegradable hydraulic oil or the environmental types might get upset
7185 2018-02-04 22:49:09 I need to get my oil changed ASAP.
7186 2018-02-04 22:49:06 I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact Venezuelan oil is cheaper than Putin's oil, makes Putin lose $$$
7187 2018-02-04 22:49:00 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
7188 2018-02-04 22:48:55 Mineral or vegetable oil is the biggest component.

7191 2018-02-04 22:48:20 Sorry they cannot pull the wool over our eyes.
I have never seen a snake oil salesman, do they exist?
uncivil servants methinks!
7192 2018-02-04 22:48:15 lol I used coconut oil
7193 2018-02-04 22:47:55 Omg this looks amazing any particular oil u used

7198 2018-02-04 22:47:10 Why when they hear democracy do they scream castor oil? Is it some fixation left over from their nursery days?
7199 2018-02-04 22:46:51 Nicks trying to cook and he's already panicked because we have olive oil but no vegetable oil and dropped an egg on the floor. 
7200 2018-02-04 22:46:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
7201 2018-02-04 22:46:15 Is it ok to start with fresh tortillas from the local factory or do I have to make them from scratch too?  Because I'm very capable of cutting up tortillas and throwing them in oil. And the local tortilla factory makes them better than I can with minimal effort.
7202 2018-02-04 22:46:08 I bet oil would drop to $30 when it was $120 in 2014. It happened.
7203 2018-02-04 22:45:27 Brexiteers are near to agreeing a compromise over the customs union as long as they can maintain their trade in snake oil.
7204 2018-02-04 22:45:19 Trump Admin threatening to boycott Venezuelan oil in support of protesters but not a word about Ahed Tamimi and the hundreds of Palestinian children illegally jailed in Israel's military detention system. #hypocrisybeforeGod
7205 2018-02-04 22:45:19 Yes open our coastal waters for more oil till the price of gas is under $1.00 a gallon
7206 2018-02-04 22:45:17 My car has been feeling weird ever since I got an oil change 
7207 2018-02-04 22:45:15 My Valentine is Roscoe. I’m spoiling tf outta him. Oil change. Wash. Vacuumed. New tire. New wiper blades. New vent clips. Juices cleaned out. Baby boy gon be fresh
7208 2018-02-04 22:44:41 Tea tree oil, aloe vera and bio oil all help
7209 2018-02-04 22:44:32 Already anti-EU, anti-Christian Fake Media like Los Angeles Times, etc. pushing narrative supporting illegal #migrants over EU Citizens rights, all to divide+weaken EU+Christians. Sunni Gulf Oil sheiks money to Fake Media to weaken EU is working well
7210 2018-02-04 22:44:26 you’re better off using a straight up moisturizer! coconut oil just gives the illusion on the surface but you also need something with water in it to moisturize deeper. Becareful about synthetic humectants, but things with honey/aloe/hyluronic acid will help! (and stay hydrated)
7211 2018-02-04 22:44:10 Too faced born this way but that one kinda oxidizes too:/  the struggle, maybe just get the fenty in a shade lighter for yourself BUTTT cover fx’s matte setting powder is SO GOOD for oil control & doesn’t have talc so it won’t clog your pores  that + the primer = 
7212 2018-02-04 22:43:57 Oil slick? Has a pollution-supporting undertone.
7213 2018-02-04 22:43:51 So does anyone really need another reason to never vote GOP again but also to actively fight this gone-rogue amoral & v dangerous political party that couldn't give a toss about well-being of the USA or the world, but sucks it up to power, especially the greasy teats of oil & oil
7214 2018-02-04 22:43:48 I thought all of the shallow pays has been depleted and they are now going for deeper shale formations.

Depth of your last well?
7215 2018-02-04 22:43:37 To the @Walmart employee that saved me $30 on oil for my car, I appreciate you
7216 2018-02-04 22:43:28 We don’t need their oil
7217 2018-02-04 22:43:27 Please where did #bbnaija bring these kids from... kbrule is still vexed cos Anto refused to kiss him yesterday...uncle will soon be red like oil they used to fry akara after eating that pepper.
7218 2018-02-04 22:43:23 I don't believe anyone that lives inland can have the feeling we do about our coast and ocean. Sorry Alta. Keep your oil.
7219 2018-02-04 22:43:23 They just want to look good. Like most  companies with their sustainability lies. They want to sell more so they want to come across as environmental friendly. That you off all people believe the advertising from big oil.

7222 2018-02-04 22:42:53 I cannot and will not defend how individ oil/gas/tarsand co's in #abpoli have abused local landowners, polluted water wells etc but #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli economies still need properly-run pipelines and/or railways for petrochems to reach export markets and thus boost govt revs
7223 2018-02-04 22:42:52 I actually love the taste of black seed oil.
7224 2018-02-04 22:42:19 Made a seasoned poached egg on toast drizzled with apple cider vinegar and extra virgin olive oil

7227 2018-02-04 22:41:32 And can it be diluted with something yummy say, like, almond oil?
7228 2018-02-04 22:41:32 I've wondered how well those cook.  I love my fryer but if tasty, air better than oil!
7229 2018-02-04 22:41:31 That's a great idea, maybe even some cinnamon oil, fennel or clove oil would be great too 
7230 2018-02-04 22:41:17 And on top of that a labour govt will nationwide every thing else save be world and make the sun shine every day ffs Britain the guys just a snake oil salesman
7231 2018-02-04 22:41:02 And as much as we should care for our bodies, we should pay more attention to our minds. For they, like lamps of oil, will grow dim with time if not replenished.”
7232 2018-02-04 22:40:59 Plain mineral oil is cheaper, without high temperature additives
7233 2018-02-04 22:40:41 I got this cbd massaging oil and I’m rly excited about it

I love experts
7236 2018-02-04 22:40:36 In all fairness, come 2035, Scotland won't be reliant on oil & gas. By then we'll be 100% renewable energy. (So long as @scotgov continues to keep investing in new technologies) We're already world leaders in this field, so who knows, maybe even earlier.
7237 2018-02-04 22:40:29 Aquaphor is god sent. Just don’t rub it on your face. Also coconut oil on your face is not the greatest!

7247 2018-02-04 22:39:21 Oil absorbing sheets are so fun to use
7248 2018-02-04 22:39:00 The Oklahoman represents all that is wrong with the news.  Their political coverage is little more than propaganda and bird cage lining.  Ok would say they will go out of business, but insure our oil overlords know propping them up is cheaper than paying taxes.
7249 2018-02-04 22:38:55 Buying a gram of oil and taking a dab every patriot score. Whether it’s field goal, touchdown, safety. Anything.
7250 2018-02-04 22:38:26 I will, i don't use shampoo on my hair but i have the 3-1 cowash conditioner, mask treatment and growth oil. I've used the pills before and currently use them, they make my hair super thick.

7264 2018-02-04 22:35:46 @Rhitrition hi Rhiannon, is there a difference between using olive oil and rapeseed oil for cooking. I notice in your book it's always olive oil. Does it make much difference to swap? Love the book btw.

7268 2018-02-04 22:35:19 I gotta change the oil on Paloma but tbh I been so lazy as if it’s so much work 
7269 2018-02-04 22:34:59 I’m like this as well but recently I’ve been using lavender oil on my pillows and I don’t know if it’s a placebo but I’ve been falling asleep in less than half an hour when usually I’d toss and turn for HOURS

7274 2018-02-04 22:33:48 He likes Donald Trump?

He employs a snake oil salesman?

Whatever the reason, some people will always dislike athletes who win. (See: LeBron.) Best to not worry about why.

And for the record, I don't really dislike him. I'm just tired of New England. There's no storyline left.
7275 2018-02-04 22:33:39 With i literally drown myself in coconut oil and I'm still getting hair losses??
7276 2018-02-04 22:33:27 "If you're selling snake oil, you don't like experts testing...", says the ex-head of the Civil Service on #PestonOnSunday. #Peston is revealing that some MPs are lying to us.
7277 2018-02-04 22:33:21 Fry them very gently in olive oil with garlic and chilli, and use as the base for a puttanesca sauce. They melt down and you can barely taste them (except for in the good way!) Also great with lamb.
7278 2018-02-04 22:33:07 @TGowdySC is my voice of reason and a man whose integrity I hold in high regard.  @RepAdamSchiff, @SenSchumer, @NancyPelosi on the other hand, complete opposite. They are snake oil salesmen. Who are you going to believe?  #FisaAbuseMemo #FISAWarrant #FISAMemoRelease #FISACourt
7279 2018-02-04 22:33:04 Oh okay, so what will then? Can't go and buy an oil for 5k and it doesn't work.. I'l just break someone's neck.
7280 2018-02-04 22:33:02 just try the Becca matte primer, it kinda crusts up if you don’t blend it in correctly but it’s the most oil controlling shit you’ll try 
7281 2018-02-04 22:33:01 Purely for the health benefits of the fish oil tbh.
7282 2018-02-04 22:33:00 It’s oil! But either way- we will overcome
7283 2018-02-04 22:32:57 Come on enegi oil vet play nice 
7284 2018-02-04 22:32:51 Please promote veganism! Animal ag accounts for 51% of all GHG emissions and animal ag accounts for 91% of all Amazon destruction. We could stop using oil, gas, electricity, etc and we’d still exceed our emissions by 2030 from JUST livestock alone.
7285 2018-02-04 22:32:43 Was just at cottman and frankford it looks like the city didnt use waterproof motor oil
7286 2018-02-04 22:32:38 White pizza is just an excuse to shovel garlic and olive oil down your throat.  Probably why I’m eating it right now.
7287 2018-02-04 22:32:33 Earth balance, would you by chance know of a brand that is good that doesn't use palm oil?
7288 2018-02-04 22:32:30 Last week was full of earnings reports of giant companies. This week we continue with a few Tech giants. #Tesla #nvidia #Twitter #TomTom.

7289 2018-02-04 22:32:16 Finessed the system and got a free oil change
7290 2018-02-04 22:32:10 You would be happy if all voices except your special interest oil industry voices were heard, wouldn’t you?
7291 2018-02-04 22:32:08 Today I was supposed to get ann oil and filter change, get my brother a bookshelf, clean my car & room, shower, get ready for the super bowl, then go to work ... I’m half way through #3 and I all I want is to take a nap
7292 2018-02-04 22:32:01 That said, first time trying to oil. Which basically consists of me saying, "Ah, I'll just leave it out." 

What will happen? Stay tuned!
7293 2018-02-04 22:31:57 Colgate, gm, ford, ibm, standard oil, dupont, is the quick run down of hitler funders, and the standard oil exec pushed for the UN. Of course they tried a coup in 33 vs fdr before funding hitler. The anti trust laws pissed em off.

7296 2018-02-04 22:31:41 Boy that will be good when it rains and washes the oil into the water sources. Pretty bad when you must grease poles so morons don’t climb them.
7297 2018-02-04 22:31:35 If you are asking: Can chilies be added to the Hollandaise, or sprinkled over all when plated?
Yes to both. We (meaning: Deb) grow habaneros, Jalapeños, Anaheims and tiny Thai peppers during our growing season; we make jams and jellies, spiced olive oil and vinegars from them.
7298 2018-02-04 22:31:06 So stop using oil. Oh wait, you can’t go 24 hours without the products and services made possible by oil.  What’s it like being a massive hypocrite?
7299 2018-02-04 22:30:35 True but as Klopp says we're not billionaires. Citeh have a shit ton of oil money we can't go toe to toe with them. Pointless to compare, 2 totally diff clubs under diff conditions. We must look within ourselves and improve at our own pace. Difficult but will be worth it
7300 2018-02-04 22:30:35 You just have to chose the best deal from the least corrupt snake oil salesman.There are no righteous man among us.We deserve justice whoever gets burned.
7301 2018-02-04 22:30:27 Yes..well did Google..and looked at a recipe..they used butter and melted in oven..another suggested oil but warned it could burn things

The Us #Dow Market went UP hard in 2017+Peaked in January 2018
Why ? =Fear of INFLATION  #FED % hikes..Spook Markets 
Truth = There is NO Wages + Consumer goods Inflation..Yet 
so the Market % Rate Rise Fear.. is Premature !
Higher $OIL prices = Inflation driver

7308 2018-02-04 22:29:08 It’s also a critique of the lack of care for vets! That the system is so fucked up a weirdo STEM dude could sell desperate people snake oil that makes them explode

7348 2018-02-04 22:22:28 Mr. Cullen, the record shows the NEB considered marine transport of the oil as part of the TMX review. If the review is as troubled as you claim, the proper remedy is to seek judicial review at the Federal Court of Appeal, not an unconstitutional end-run of federal jurisdiction.

Garlic sauce from royal kabab in hamtramck

Tamarind, garlic chutney and achaar are all good but none distinguish themselves enough for me. Heinz ketchup is terrible though and Desi ketchup is way better

7398 2018-02-04 22:15:08 Yes I agree, but chip shops are not using either of those. Most of them use a commercially blended oil exclusively for the fish & chip trade. The best oil in the business is supplied by the catering division of Kraft Foods whose European headquarters are in Holland.  QED

7409 2018-02-04 22:13:42 Went to get my oil changed at a shop by Jesuit, and the guy asked me if I went to school there. I don’t know if I’m more confused as to how he thought I was male or how he thought I was in high school 
7410 2018-02-04 22:13:39 The DNC is bankrupt.
Every Democrat run city is in chaos.
California is insolvent and cannot rectify.
The richest country in the world for oil reserves Venezuela is a cot case.
Not very good publicity for left wing socialist policies.

7419 2018-02-04 22:12:47 Compared to the conflict we have today with ISIS, recent Al Queda it was small potatoes Andy. Recheck the numbers. It was a handful of incidents not even comparable to today. 1 Millon Iraqis died under military occupation by the west. 1 million. For what? Oil. Nothing more.
7420 2018-02-04 22:12:42 That article is about high pressure injection wounds. Any liquid under pressure can do that. Getting hydro oil on your skin won't do that.
7421 2018-02-04 22:12:12 My go to is any dark greens (kale, spinach, chicory, etc...) tomatoes, cucumber, goat cheese, dried cranberries, walnuts, homemade honey balsamic, and grilled chicken. Another is dark greens mixed with romaine, sun dried tomatoes, feta, olives, balsamic and olive oil.

7424 2018-02-04 22:12:05 Block the pipeline... you have the majority of B.C. voters support. Only 1 tanker collision off the coast will destroy BCs economy for 10+ years. You think Alberta will pay? No, they’d blame the oil company that would blame the pipeline that would blame the tanker
7425 2018-02-04 22:12:03 Rode like 3 motos. Noticed it was low. Nome of us had oil. Axel came through but with Maxima. Ran it 2 motos and was leaking bad. So I rode the 450 the rest of the day.

7441 2018-02-04 22:09:56 Little one--now 8-years-old--likes them on pizza (with tuna) or on top of chopped tomatoes. You can also put a baking tray with cherry tomatoes & salt in the oven. When roasted add anchovies, olive oil & oregano. Hey presto. Cold white wine optional.
7442 2018-02-04 22:09:56 Do you use veg. oil or butter in the bottom of each tin?

7448 2018-02-04 22:08:26 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
7449 2018-02-04 22:08:17 I'm 17, hardly college age. I don't even know what you're point is here, abhorrent means it's disliked, hated, oil drilling is very dislikable. 'Survey says?' You do not know what abhorrent means' is the number 1 answer!

7456 2018-02-04 22:07:17 @walmarthelp Your team needs to rethink how you intake customers at your Auto Centers. Your system & equipment is antiquated. Waited in a sweltering car for over 90 minutes just to have my information taken. Didn’t include the oil change. I’m never coming back. It’s not worth it.
7457 2018-02-04 22:07:16 Where are the sanctions on #Russia? Maybe you and#Trump have huge interest in the oil in the land of #Putin...
7458 2018-02-04 22:07:15 Whats more, you assume that because I beleive in human caused climate change I am against resource extraction and oil in general. I am not. Modern society is dependent on plastic. I just beleive that we shouldnt socialize the risk for private industry.
7459 2018-02-04 22:07:15 Dish soap n little bit of olive oil  on a plate with lime warm water 
7460 2018-02-04 22:07:11 Yes.  Beware of the “snake oil” salesman.

7465 2018-02-04 22:06:58 He told @rejected_rebel and @sadbandboys that his jug of water was cooking oil so yes
7466 2018-02-04 22:06:57 You say & BC “should benefit from our own resources” (Oil). Well why is BC crying @Trump putting huge tariffs on BC Lumber. Our Lumber prices dropped in . You say Oil is raping the environment. Look @ BC raping Millons of acres of Forest for export $
7467 2018-02-04 22:06:49 We are in Cochrane today taking on Bow Valley.
7468 2018-02-04 22:06:18 For Newcastle United on behalf on a multi multi billionaire oil baron a friend of mine, same investor who wanted to by Bolton Wanderers.
7469 2018-02-04 22:05:43 Obstructionist how am I an obstructionist? Trump is working for the people of this country. All of them. I just got a pay raise because of the tax breaks. Dems all voted against it. My 401k looks better than it has in 10 years. Oil industry just hit 1070s production
7470 2018-02-04 22:05:19 'If you are selling snake oil you don't want experts examining your products'
No wonder @michaelgove doesn't like experts.
7471 2018-02-04 22:05:10 I may be burning the midnight oil to get my part done. #carproblems #sickmotherinlaw
7472 2018-02-04 22:04:45 How can Gus O'Donnell be taken seriously when he says the civil service is impartial, and then in the same breath describes Brexiteers as "snake oil salesmen"? #itvnews #peston
7473 2018-02-04 22:04:23 Society actually uses oil. Canada imports hundreds of thousands of barrels a day. Your analogy is pure sophistry. Money that would contribute to Canadian economy goes out. Debt goes up. Ability to fund social programs and green energy goes down. Win for foreign oil. #SJWSophistry
7474 2018-02-04 22:04:20 Horgan only asked for a review of the cleanup regime. If they're as ROBUST as touted, then you, Big Oil & the Fed's got no worries.
7475 2018-02-04 22:04:04 Yes it is getting grants of the government- how ever the oil companies get more
7476 2018-02-04 22:03:55 Pre pan fry your pepperoni. No oil or anything needed. Takes a ton of grease out and you get crunchy pepperoni
7477 2018-02-04 22:03:51 I never met an oil pastel I didn't like...
7478 2018-02-04 22:03:47 That's because Brexit is snake oil. A project of the extreme right.
7479 2018-02-04 22:03:47 Not unless u work w/them to undermine our elections. Not unless u refuse to enact new sanctions while simultaneously allowing Russian spies into the country while also allowing ships with Sanctioned oil & gas from Russia to dock in our ports. If u do those things, u will get FBI.

ちなhomosexual is to me what water is to oilの方がisで統一できてきれいかもしれない
7483 2018-02-04 22:03:06 Yes, I would certainly like to know about where the ru oil flows, especially the flow to USA.
7484 2018-02-04 22:02:58 Popeyes is the bomb....much like what caused the oil rig explosion near that head.  But aye...It's all good.  
7485 2018-02-04 22:02:45 Did not feel like I was buying snake oil when I voted to Leave
7486 2018-02-04 22:02:40 'The Irritating Gentleman' - Berthold Woltze - Oil on Canvas - 1874
7487 2018-02-04 22:02:37 I don't recall anybody saying oil and gas would last for ever...but it certainly can be used as a source of funding to diversify and expand certain areas of the economy. For an "expert" he sure is a fud.
7488 2018-02-04 22:02:33 To maliciously exacerbate an economic crisis in order to fit a narrative that their economy sucks. How about instead we BUY oil from Venezuela to help alleviate problems. China won't let Venezuela fail anyway, so why not be good instead of evil
7489 2018-02-04 22:02:18 Olive oil and salt as dressing.
7490 2018-02-04 22:02:05 Also forgot I put Olbas oil on a tissue and used it to wipe my eye.. why does the world hate me this weekend?!
7491 2018-02-04 22:01:58 I'll look at it, I promise. I have to complete a spreadsheet for disposing of ~100 poison gas cylinders for one of our oil/gas clients for tomorrow.  Managing this stuff is very expensive, and that is part of the reason the EPA is under attack. Disposing of waste costs  money.
7492 2018-02-04 22:01:57 意味がわかりません。
7493 2018-02-04 22:01:34 Wheres citys history? All i see is oil money
7494 2018-02-04 22:01:24 Go get yourself some clove oil tomorrow.  Most pharmacies  should sell it also those in larger supermarkets.
7495 2018-02-04 22:01:01 I use my spray bottle with water and a little leave in conditioner Nd some days i use a mixture of coconut, sweet almond and sunflower oil.
7496 2018-02-04 22:01:00 sounds like his pockets are lined by the oil companies.
7497 2018-02-04 22:00:45 semi , you'll soon eat your words. And my fresh homemade sourdough dipped in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar
7498 2018-02-04 22:00:38 Bush = "War criminal" ! Trump too! Let God sort them out. They'll BOTH have much CAUSE for REGRET. No way to ESCAPE their Fates & no way to REPAY ghoulish harm they've both caused. Riches cannot save them!I HOPE I live long enough to see the FUN!! GENOCIDE & MURDER-for-OIL.

7500 2018-02-04 22:00:29 According to the National Petroleum Agency, #ANP figures & marking a 1st in its history, December 2017's oil production in #Brazil saw more than half attributed to its pre salt exploration areas

7503 2018-02-04 22:00:16 Philly: Don’t let the rain distract you from the fact that it is rinsing that “oil substance” off of the poles so we can climb them when the Eagles win. #FlyEaglesFly #SBLII 
7504 2018-02-04 22:00:11 February 04, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7505 2018-02-04 22:00:09 coconut oil is the nectar of the gods
7506 2018-02-04 21:59:57 You want some oil?
7507 2018-02-04 21:59:55 i thought i needed the rush , but it was never enough. all i needed was some coconut oil 
7508 2018-02-04 21:59:55 Must be Wild Root Creme Oil. No wait. That was also discontinued.
7509 2018-02-04 21:59:53 Another Coleman comment:  just as with land-based env regs, BC cannot frustrate federally-approved oil transport. As always, BC can argue that it’s regs do not frustrate fed approval of interprovincial/international trade. There is no silver bullet that will allow BC to stop TMX
7510 2018-02-04 21:59:46 i knew i was trans the first time i laid eyes on an oil refinery
7511 2018-02-04 21:59:45 Yes, absolutely! We have a lot of customers who have has great success with using our Shea & Coconut oil free body butters. A little bit goes a long way & caters to a wide range of skin irritants, our butters are gentle yet, highly effective 
7512 2018-02-04 21:59:44 When odunlade has forced him and baba Latin out
7513 2018-02-04 21:59:36 Lettuce of choice, chikpeas, ham, tuna, corn, and, most important, rice (of choice). 

You can use vinegar, olive oil and salt or a cream cheese-mayo-water sauce
7514 2018-02-04 21:59:36 They’re putting motor oil on lightposts in Philly. Of course we are going to have some crazy vids. Those people are crazy.
7515 2018-02-04 21:59:22 Nationalize oil like you should have.
7516 2018-02-04 21:59:15 Man ever since I bought these oil burners for the crib my life hasn’t been the same.
7517 2018-02-04 21:59:00 NW kind and Claywolf both had significant price drops! Now anyone can get some top shelf oil!
7518 2018-02-04 21:58:44 I can’t give you my obedience. I can’t give you my purpose. I can’t give you my walk with God. You have to have your own oil for your lamp (Matthew 25). - Pastor Tory Gant “Our Time Will Come”
7519 2018-02-04 21:58:37 Yup
7520 2018-02-04 21:58:19 You're aiming down amigo, you're supposed to shoot for the stars friend. I think a better steward of the environment would be one who doesn't spill oil all the time, by not drilling it, one who doesn't pollute our air, by not putting clouds of pollutants in it
7521 2018-02-04 21:58:08 Taxes, resumes (some do this but not all), general car maintenance like oil, tires, brakes, and air filters
7522 2018-02-04 21:58:07 And there we have it! 
The Government can just keep it ...
Kinda like dipshvt wants to do with Iraq's oil ...
7523 2018-02-04 21:57:56 Underway from Oil Guys Center!
7524 2018-02-04 21:57:50 There should be no relish in deviled eggs! Olive oil Miracle Whip with olive oil.
7525 2018-02-04 21:57:48 I feel sooo great right now  I shaved put body oil on scrub and face mask i feel like I’m sitting on clouds right now
7526 2018-02-04 21:57:42 $1.50 a week is crumbs you moron when the wealthy are getting millions. $1.50 a week won't even pay for the higher gas prices since Trump took office. Oil companies will be making out like the thieves they are with your tax scam.
7527 2018-02-04 21:57:35 Philly police are now putting motor oil on poles instead of Crisco.

Meaning the entire city will ACTUALLY be up in flames if the Eagles win.
7528 2018-02-04 21:57:29 Wait where is Baba Suwe,hope he's still alive

7532 2018-02-04 21:56:53 Beets and feta is a good one, with lemon and olive oil. I also grab the bags of shredded veggies for coleslaw from the grocery store and build salads with that, peppers, chick peas (any beans), farro, berries, pre-cooked chicken.
7533 2018-02-04 21:56:37 Services such as Medicare. While he has employed a record number of Goldman Sachs ceos in his cabinet. Education is suffering at his cabinet pics and the environment is being raped by his oil Barron friends who consistently fund republican campaigns.

7536 2018-02-04 21:56:34 So so true! I’m trying to find that book company with no luck at all. Probably gone to bed with a cup of this immunitea and a cannabis oil face mask 
7537 2018-02-04 21:56:22 also coconut & argan oil masks 
7538 2018-02-04 21:56:03 I hope you're buying these items at the Dollar Store. I mean veg. oil COULD be taxed, so...
7539 2018-02-04 21:55:56 That’s pretty funny. Now it’s all about secret oil fields and historical grievance. They’ve gone full on hate-Nat nowadays compared to simply lying about things 1.3 generations ago.
7540 2018-02-04 21:55:52 Finally got my oil changed after being 900 miles over due :))))

7542 2018-02-04 21:55:15 There's a good oil reserve there isn't there?
7543 2018-02-04 21:55:15 Everyone knows land is the best "investment" during good times. So when the times are good in Saudi Arabia, billions from from oil find their way into land speculation. When the returns are so high from land, why would anyone bother to invest in building real things like housing?
7544 2018-02-04 21:54:57 I think the oil on then
7545 2018-02-04 21:54:57 #Vancouver #Burnaby - There's an oil spill on the Boundary on-ramp to #BCHWY1 westbound. Use extreme caution! ^rc

7548 2018-02-04 21:54:39 Agreed. Parallel is learning the value of these minerals. Seal the bottom of of our pockets. Tell me 1 king or queen in Africa with our golden, silver etc crown. Again, we Africans tend to be very emotional and leave our brains behind. Look at Nigeria oil, Drc, Sierra leon etc.

7550 2018-02-04 21:54:22 They weren't irrelevant when the PET government bailed out Syncrude in the 70s and when the Chrétien Liberals bailed out the oil sands again in 1996 with Accelerated Capital Cost Allowances worth $300 million/year until 2010, when the Conservatives phased them out (2014).
7551 2018-02-04 21:54:21 Realistically, how many who complain about moving oil around ride bicycles everywhere? Everyone in my transit-served neighbourhood has 2 cars in the driveway.
7552 2018-02-04 21:54:11 Snake oil was marketed in the same manner a century ago...

7556 2018-02-04 21:53:51 The reason they’re supporting trump with not sanctioning Russia is because they make a shit load of money off of that country! Big oil for Tillerson & big bucks for Mnuchin!

7557 2018-02-04 21:53:37 Funny....it is funny also...

Philly police are now putting motor oil on poles instead of Crisco.

Meaning the entire city will ACTUALLY be up in flames if the Eagles win.

7561 2018-02-04 21:52:47 If you want to appear submissive and weak. 
Why Dems promote followers to kneel.

7564 2018-02-04 21:51:54 Awesome! This is outside of my back window :) the birds love our cedars and Rose of Sharon. They must love the back oil sunflower seeds! Thanks!
7565 2018-02-04 21:51:46 you are a billionaire many times over. you waste tax dollars in security to go to Florida all the time. You sold America out to Russia. You have intention on exploiting the poor in America in labor with contracts from Russia drilling oil. Your hard heart amazes me.
7566 2018-02-04 21:51:45 You only care about making huge oil companies richer. And use pseudo science and Faux News to do it.
You have zero credibility among intelligent and/or knowledgeable people.
7567 2018-02-04 21:51:28 Good point. The ancient Romans are generally credited with developing the wicked candle by dipping rolled papyrus repeatedly in melted tallow or beeswax. However the ancient Egyptians were already using wicked candles 3000 BCE. But yes, you’re right Romans widely used oil lamps.

7571 2018-02-04 21:50:44 So NYC is looking at about a $4.5 Billion budget deficit. NYC is also planning on suing Oil Companies over "Climate Change damages" for $5 Billion. The two are totally not related, I am sure... #SMH
7572 2018-02-04 21:50:33 Damn I need to find more of these oil cartridges. Where's the Cali connect at?

7575 2018-02-04 21:49:47 In a throw back to the good old days of studio living in Paris, I'm sitting surrounded by wet oil paintings, palette knives and brushes in turps in Doonbeg. 

This room and that flat are about the same size too!
7576 2018-02-04 21:49:09 It's submissive and weak. Not surprising dems approve
7577 2018-02-04 21:49:08 How many of you work or have worked directly in the oil/gas industry?

Because that is your bias.

The more you deny it, the less respectable you become.
7578 2018-02-04 21:49:06 Seems less gross than mayo and coconut oil actually is pretty bad for leaving buildup. Also it's really bad for drains.
7579 2018-02-04 21:49:05 is coconut oil bad for ur hair pls lmk
7580 2018-02-04 21:49:02 You've never had Sicilian eggplant. Grilled with olive oil, it's creamy, mostly seedless and not bitter. It's nothing like what we associate eggplant with. It's like vegetable foie gras.

7583 2018-02-04 21:48:58 Interesting, or arrogant, of US to admit they are continuing to prosecute the illegal Obama/Soros-backed, systematic obliteration of #Syria & stalking of Assad! No shame. No conscience. No decency, or respect for national sovereignty. Just CRIMINAL & MURDEROUS conduct for OIL. 
7584 2018-02-04 21:48:43 Yea... i just use face cleanser no oil..nothing
7585 2018-02-04 21:48:40 No oil to fry my chicken 
7586 2018-02-04 21:48:40 But there is nothing Engineering here now, its a point you can expand on. We have benefited immensely in different ways, Opec made a choice for us not to cut production cause of Niger delta boys even tho they wanted to bring oil prices up
7587 2018-02-04 21:48:24 Dictator Uhuru Kenyatta is doing what he's doing because US/UK and by great extension Trump and Obama are stealing Kenyan oil at Turkana..Kenyans we have a choice;survive suffering and we all die a slow painful death or fight our way out from American colonization? CHOOSE?
7588 2018-02-04 21:48:02 So if there is a Cascadian Subduction Zone as promoted by the Democrats; then how can there be oil deposits?
7589 2018-02-04 21:48:01 Foraminifera fall like rain to the sea bed. Over eons the continents move and the land is folded and heated and folded, layer upon layer. Eventually, in the deepest of depths, the carbon deposits form oil and coal. In #McMafia something is about to happen
7590 2018-02-04 21:47:50 Have you tried the Blistex relief cream in a tube? It’s SO GOOD- it goes on white but then runs into a nice light gloss and it feels like it locks moisture in. I found coconut oil just made them worse! Honestly try it, it’s really good!
7591 2018-02-04 21:47:13 They are good for you but tinned ones v salty & best used as flavourings in stews & sauces. Fresh ones in oil from deli counter best eaten with fingers from the pot like a filthy harlot.
7592 2018-02-04 21:47:03 People must boycott palm oil products, especially Nutella!
7593 2018-02-04 21:47:00 @realDonaldTrump the very best you can do at this point, Mr. Trump, is to admit you’re a snake oil salesman. It does us no good otherwise.
7594 2018-02-04 21:46:10 Anybody have any essential oil diffuser recommendations?
7595 2018-02-04 21:45:58 gettin my all meats pizza, and cold bud lights, ready for the game go patriots #BlitzForSix #DoYourJob america we love to liberate oil
7596 2018-02-04 21:45:45 I think they should stop using olive oil because the Italians use it in their cooking
7597 2018-02-04 21:45:10 Young living has a natural vitamin called sleep essence. It's awesome! Im 22 weeks and couldnt sleep either until I got it. Or try a smudge of cedarwood oil between your brows.
7598 2018-02-04 21:45:05 This is the new oil.

7600 2018-02-04 21:44:51 @PhillyPolice - Will GEAR OIL work better than CRISCO to grease poles so #Eagles fans can't climb?

7601 2018-02-04 21:44:45 Can't stop drugs but we'll stop oil in pipelines all over central and South America
7602 2018-02-04 21:44:41 @MaitlandWard omfg baby oil?!

7604 2018-02-04 21:44:28 Do you have olive oil?
7605 2018-02-04 21:44:18 Dedication to a routine. Sugar/coconut oil and lavender scrub, green tea blemish control gel, tea tree foaming face wash and lots of water.
7606 2018-02-04 21:44:18 Target: "Source 100% certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) by 2015." 
Achieved: ""In 2016, we increased our procurement of physically certified sustainable palm oil to 16 percent of our volume..."

Pathetic.
7607 2018-02-04 21:44:14 I buy fresh Avacados weekly. I slice them and add olive oil, I made fresh #Guac once every 2 weeks. #GuacWorld #gno
7608 2018-02-04 21:43:48 Clearly, we need to move off oil quickly for many reasons including the fact that it supports some horrible people running (ruining) some countries. Then there is the pollution caused by fossil fuels that is ruining people’s health.
7609 2018-02-04 21:43:48 He doesn’t deserve a seat.   He’s not for the farmers he is to represent.  He’s just another salesman selling snake oil.
7610 2018-02-04 21:43:46 Go buy waste oil. As we're finishing up dude's 70 year old, Scandinavian father in law comes out:

Fox: well, it'll have to be her

7621 2018-02-04 21:41:22 Get to work on that 2020 dossier RNC. Republicans can insert names once we find out who's running. It's a dem approved standard now.
7622 2018-02-04 21:41:01 From reading up, I don't think it isn't anything to be worried about. Apparently rubbing some cooking oil should fix it up, then just make a habit out of cleaning the knife as soon as you're finished cutting with it.
7623 2018-02-04 21:40:57  im saying it should be petty money to him and the art is actually good for it to have been painted with oil, its hard not to mess up

7636 2018-02-04 21:39:57 Donald Trump is a liar . He doesn’t believe in anything that isn’t money. He is going to destroy our land our national monuments, our water ,our air and all for the almighty dollar. Big Oil, Gas, and Coal. Corporate America nothing else matters except maybe his rich friends.
7637 2018-02-04 21:39:55 If Italy, France, Germany, UK, US, Saudis, Qataris and their proxy puppet Jihadis weren't rampaging about the fucking middle east destroying nation after nation on an imperial quest for oil, gold and control of central banks, we wouldnt have a migrant crisis.
7638 2018-02-04 21:39:45 This includes Lemon essential oil as well correct? I saw a youtube vid with someone using it and I was skeptical.
7639 2018-02-04 21:39:42 Ooh! Toast, olive oil, sliced tomatoes, anchovies on top. Mind your hand on the tin. I needed five stitches after the last encounter.
7640 2018-02-04 21:39:19 You are not serious about Climate Change. You want to build a pipeline and ship more of our oil to Asia all while you import more oil from Middle Eastern dictatorships. Climate Scientists and Humanitarian orgs would disagree with both policies. Your words mean as much as Cherrys.

7684 2018-02-04 21:34:18 The real story of the #NunesMemo is Carter Page, and credible evidence that he was working as an agent of a foreign government: Russia. And the real story of Carter Page (and Russia) is one of #Oil.
7685 2018-02-04 21:34:18 I use the kroger store brand mix, in a blender I puree half a diced avocado, half the amount of oil the box calls for, and substitute soymilk for the other half of the oil, then mix the puree in with the mix. If it seems dry splash in a bit more soymilk. Bake according to box.

7689 2018-02-04 21:33:45 We had three weeks without heating as our oil central heater conked out (tricky to get parts on an island) so I know what it's like waiting all night to get the cold edge off! Should be great in Spring, tho'.
7690 2018-02-04 21:33:43 Learnt a very VERY valuable life lesson today. NEVER put olbas oil in your bath if you have a cold. I really don't know where hurts the most right now
7691 2018-02-04 21:33:43 Everything from eggs and sausage to fried tomatoes (he he) have finely diced garlic with olive oil. Probably the only reason my heart still works.

7697 2018-02-04 21:33:36 I used to suffer with that - I found spraying magnesium oil on the soles of my feet worked - it relaxes the muscles. That and good insoles and I get very few pains now with it - it used to be agony setting feet on the floor first thing every morning - hope you get relief soon

7709 2018-02-04 21:31:15 Get you a big ole Vidalia onion, slice it, batter it, fry it in kanola oil. Your tongue’s liable to knock an eyebrow off.

7711 2018-02-04 21:30:58 Yeah but you think that's gonna be the case cause of so many countries like Venezuela north Korea Iran could buy the oil and barter trade while they may think that sanctions may help it hasn't stopped north Korea.

7718 2018-02-04 21:30:27 I usually just squeeze lemon and throw a bit of extra virgin olive oil on my salad... Or I make dressing but I like the jarred dressing for quick sandwich spreads or veggie dips

7727 2018-02-04 21:28:37 Nothing to explain. This is how to America.
GMO runs agriculture.
Logging runs forestry.
Pharma runs medicine.
And Exxon doesn’t just run the environment; it runs the State Department cuz we understand ourselves correctly: as an oil company with an army.
7728 2018-02-04 21:28:23 He wants to do that so the US can sell more oil. Of course, it’s killing all of us, but those who hoard money don’t care as long as they get more money. Always more...

7730 2018-02-04 21:28:11 Crypto market is like the stock market like the oil market like the corn market.  During period of mania it is traded in emotions and not fundamental. That a why good traders like me make good money on noobs and young kids thinking crypto will change the world.

7736 2018-02-04 21:27:38 Conservatives don’t want the truth. They want to hear that the world is reversing to the fifties when America was “great”. They don’t want to hear how soldiers get PTSD, how animals are becoming extinct, how oil and gas are polluting our world so badly our climate is changing.
7737 2018-02-04 21:27:31 somebody needs to limit global oil supply so that the price would go up - Putin's war preparation needs cash.

7748 2018-02-04 21:26:12 We do because of oil. We have had an almost 40 year proxy war over it spanning democrats and republican admins. Clinton era docs had every country we screwed with, including syria and libya in the late 90s. Saddam was a cia plant as it were
7749 2018-02-04 21:25:57 I don't think a tablespoon of oil and baking makes sweet potatoes suddenly unhealthy. That seems like too harsh a criteria to me.

7763 2018-02-04 21:24:03 I think we need a shift in perspective. It is hard to break patterns. In nature when a species over hunts they die off. The trouble is nature's balancing of our stupidity will be an existential threat for all of us. Scientists for oil and gas will say everything's fine, but . . .

7826 2018-02-04 21:14:41 Likened to a Snake oil salesman!  By extension, a snake oil salesman is someone who knowingly sells fraudulent goods or who is a fraud, quack, or charlatan.

7844 2018-02-04 21:11:40 Your country exchanged our electoral justice for a dual carriage road construction from Nairobi to Msa. For Kshs 330 billion you sold our soul and now want our oil. Shame on US
7845 2018-02-04 21:11:33 Most upstream oil companies produce oil that is per-barrel far less carbon- and water-intensive, so that would help the planet.  Doesn't help jobs in Alberta, but that is a different issue.

7865 2018-02-04 21:09:23 They have zero credibility. Their only job and purpose is to deny science and push the right wing oil interests to continue unrestrained capitalism and the utter debit brings.
They use the Koch Bros/Peabody propaganda to further their conspiracy theories.

7869 2018-02-04 21:08:31 Fishing industry on coast is roughly $144 million and total tourism in Oregon, of which the coast is a big portion, is over $10 billion. I've walked on tar ball beaches in Texas (gross to say the least) & we already know what oil spills do to fishing industries.
7870 2018-02-04 21:08:24 The Rockefellers literally sold snake oil, ruined the medical industry by vilifying and outlawing true healers (which continues today), got us off the gold standard and onto the petrodollar scheme that necessitates endless wars. The list could go on.

Trying to abolish protections:

- bad investment for industry 
- worse for Utah’s economic future

7874 2018-02-04 21:07:33 Construction costs already high for alternatives. Labour is scarce in Canada. Expensive pipeline and oil sands projects just increase the cost of building alternatives.

7901 2018-02-04 21:02:21 I need oil paint pens
7902 2018-02-04 21:02:06 Agreed! Unless oil companies rapidly reinvent themselves as 'Energy Companies' supplying power for EVs, they will struggle to survive 10-15 yrs from now. H2 & Fuel Cell might have a role in HGV & shipping, but BEV will dominate the car sector.
7903 2018-02-04 21:01:59 Oil pulling activates enzymes that have a powerful detoxifying affect on our entire system; they literally pull toxins, bacteria, fungus, and other nasty bugs from the mouth and the entire body, helping to cleanse our blood.
7904 2018-02-04 21:01:46 The Canadian TSX has made zero headway for an entire year. By ignoring high tech and fixating on oil pipelines Canada is cemented in emerging market status.
7905 2018-02-04 21:01:36 Oil pulling is the act of swishing oil (usually Sesame, Sunflower or Coconut) in the mouth for up to 20 minutes to improve oral health.

7910 2018-02-04 21:01:13 yes! correct, the same reason they sent young people to die in a war to get their oil, they pander to scared poor white poeple to get their vote to get more power. its just greed. its not personal. they're just assholes.
7911 2018-02-04 21:01:05 Invest in wind, solar and electrical storage & transmission. All of those sectors produce more jobs than oil.
7912 2018-02-04 21:01:01 This is a nonsense conspiracy theory that's been disproved with ease.  The amount of money being alleged stolen in oil would've taken centuries to accumulate at Iraq's production rate at the time, and all the gold ever located on Earth does not equal the amount alleged stolen
7913 2018-02-04 21:00:58 Every $1 that leaves is never taxed again. 
Gov relies on fact circulating dollars are taxed everytime they change hands. This is net loss

7915 2018-02-04 21:00:54 well chicken wings are pretty basic - what you have to ask is do you want to deep fry them or braise them - frying, toss in seasoned chickpea flour or masa then fry, toss in whatever mixture of hot or sweet sauces you prefer - braising, saute in oil and onions...
7916 2018-02-04 21:00:54 Good to hear. I've been making my own mayonnaise using olive oil rather than using the store-bought mayo that's made with soybean oil.
7917 2018-02-04 21:00:52 Soy or almond milk. Pea protein, coconut oil and lots of other stuff. It’s much better than it used to be and melts now! Used to be terrible but so many vegan products are getting better. I still love real cheese
7918 2018-02-04 21:00:38 Makes me wonder —  how likely is it that Cicero would have used candles, instead of oil lamps?
7919 2018-02-04 21:00:32 No, oil price is less than half what it was. And I'd suggest you'd read the SNP white paper, oil was the BASIS of the economy they planned.

7939 2018-02-04 20:56:53 We can invest in those alternative, without increasing the supply of fossil fuels. Supply and demand. Increase the supply while demand falls, prices plummet. Cheaper oil is a disincentive to use less oil or build the alternatives.

7952 2018-02-04 20:55:18 All this Momentum/Moggery nonsense just adds to my feeling that the next election is going to be much like choosing your method of execution; torn apart by wolves or lowered into a vat of boiling oil. Very different spectacles but fundamentally the same outcome.

7958 2018-02-04 20:54:26 Doesn't curcumin & curry powder have turmeric in it?  I put turmeric, ginger, pepper & cinnamon in warm lemon water every morning and today had to add some coconut oil with just learning that turmeric is fat soluble.

7960 2018-02-04 20:54:24 plant based oil. veg oil is CARCINOgenic..aka fake... repels fleas/mites from pets...keeps dental /mouth free of mal organisms and more. 1 tbsp/day in mouth/cook with it as  well but don't  use  non stick  cookware.
7961 2018-02-04 20:54:12 Venezuela has the worlds largest Oil reserve and socialism has reduced it to a sh*thole.
If anybody wants to see socialism in its pure form look at Venezuela.
7962 2018-02-04 20:54:06 Not much of any other choice other that the Green guy. Unless maybe they are hoping for an oil pipeline through #Kelowna
7963 2018-02-04 20:53:39 This guy is in it to hook up @exxonmobil , please you foreign policy is to benefit oil companies not what’s in Our best interest.
7964 2018-02-04 20:53:32 No,I refuse to agree,that Num 11 was the cause of the problem
7965 2018-02-04 20:53:27 They are on OUR continental shelf.
Anyway, I don´t care about the islands at all.
Even knowing that you only want them because it´s a strategic place of the earth and for the huge amount of oil in that place
7966 2018-02-04 20:53:22 اي
7967 2018-02-04 20:52:56 They have lots of oil of their own which is processed in #Aruba
7968 2018-02-04 20:52:35 Coconut oil, rosemary oil, Apple cider vinegar and castor oil
7969 2018-02-04 20:52:26 And increase profitsblitly for US oil companies.
7970 2018-02-04 20:52:22 I don't care about the result, but I do hate the TB12Method snake oil method being touted about as real science. Will pledge $2 per Patriots point to @HealthLeadsNatl so people in need get ACTUAL scientifically proven help #AGoodGame

7972 2018-02-04 20:52:14 and to manipulate prices, make deals, push #Oil biz to partners.... this is what the job of secretary of state is all about in the #Tillerson era.
7973 2018-02-04 20:51:58 Stir, then mw another minute, stir... repeat until you like the consistency (2.5 min. Usually enough)

Tbsp Olive oil in poaching cups with hint of sea salt, add a beaten egg to each cup then ground pepper. MW at power 8 for 1 minute 45 seconds.

The microwave bacon : 2 min. @ 10
7974 2018-02-04 20:51:50 So what you’re saying is on this committee there should’ve been only pro oil sands people? That sounds more to me like a fascist stance than a democratic one
7975 2018-02-04 20:51:44 venezuela’s economy is so dependent on oil, you wouldn’t believe. it’s one of the only money makers they had/have. after this, corporations began deserting venezuela and sabotaging the economy because of popular reforms. a huge part of the instability there is due to the fascists
7976 2018-02-04 20:51:26 Lol. In that case, other countries should stop selling oil to us.

7991 2018-02-04 20:49:47 Now THAT would be very significant - especially on rising oil prices.  Venezuela is shipping crude oil to the US Gulf Coast, letting the US refineries refine it, and bringing the gasoline and diesel fuel back to Venezuela.

8003 2018-02-04 20:48:38 Spiritual books
To meditate on religious matters, one must have read, otherwise there is nothing to meditate on. The lamp has no oil. But read slowly, and think upon what has been read. Books rapidly run through and unreflected upon are as valueless as food eaten but not digested

W/ its high vitamin E content, argan oil is the ideal product to give skin a natural boost. It absorbs easily and is non-greasy & non-irritating. It’s also a natural moisturiser.

8020 2018-02-04 20:47:11 Please an embargo to Venezuela oil will make Maduro stronger and excuses not to pay debt and less money to run the economy! Apply personal sactions and if possible trap them when they travel
8021 2018-02-04 20:47:11 $30B for Exxon.. then there's Valero, Chevron, Marathon, Conoco, Enterprise and that's just the US oil companies!  Before you know it you've got $100+ per week back in workers pockets.

8026 2018-02-04 20:46:40 Note geographical fact post #indyref2 as one economist said, without oil rUk property market is in dire trouble with no slush funds to balance out loss.
8027 2018-02-04 20:46:38 3/ In the west, election period is not really a period to look for a working government but rather personal gains because the vast majority of people coming to vote are poor people who have collected rice or oil or cash. That is how it is in the west and many other parts

8031 2018-02-04 20:46:11 I would like to think in terms of persuading large, resource laden organizations, aka the oil giants, to realize that it is in their and their stakeholder's best interest to "see the light", and become partners in the fossil to nuclear switch.  Pie in the sky?

Oil at $70 bbl and 900,000 bbl/day ( some sources 1.5mbbl/day)= $23bn = £16bn
Just shy of £92bn

There are queries over some UK exports being Scottish in origin but not credited

8096 2018-02-04 20:39:09 Focaccia, studded with rosemary and dotted with salt, dipped into verdant green smoked olive oil. The rest of supper is noise.
8097 2018-02-04 20:38:47 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.
8098 2018-02-04 20:38:44 Just cabbage cooked in a skillet. Cut, with a little oil, butter, pepper, seasoning
8099 2018-02-04 20:38:33 The comedic timing of these dudes changing my oil is on point.
8100 2018-02-04 20:38:26 Tried cooking with coconut oil and all my food taste like coconut 
8101 2018-02-04 20:38:05 Adding that pudgy opioid addicted fuck-knuckle Rush Limbarf and that snake oil salesman/human form of actual stupid Alex Jones.
8102 2018-02-04 20:38:02 Probably only indirectly. Page looked up info in the public domain--primarily dealing w/ the petroleum & gas industries. Futures purchases are one way to hedge losses due to sanctions. Title swapping of oil & gas in transit is another.
8103 2018-02-04 20:37:54 Psalms 23:4-5  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
8104 2018-02-04 20:37:45 I keep forgetting to get an oil change
8105 2018-02-04 20:37:35 I believe he works in oil- but there are a few interviews online where I'm sure Daniel discusses it :)
8106 2018-02-04 20:37:27 The European and North American NATO liberals want TTIP, coal & fracking to pursue an aggressive anti-Russia foreign policy agenda/oil profits under Rex #Tillerson.

8110 2018-02-04 20:37:12 It never stopped the selling of "snake oil"....
You can only do so much.
Not everyone is as enamored of you as I.
8111 2018-02-04 20:37:10 The world is changing these extremist are beholden to oil,we are setting ourselves free of this poison for our children and our planet
8112 2018-02-04 20:37:09 Exactly so did my family. There was no plantation money/land handed down, they just worked their ass off with what they had. I know a guy who lived in a trailer house and worked constantly to learn the oil business and within five years he went from borderline poverty to wealth
8113 2018-02-04 20:37:08 Meanwhile 5 oil and gas companies saw $11 dollars and we’re now running a trillion dollar deficit outside of war or a recession.
8114 2018-02-04 20:37:06 Excellent question. Another Dreamer?
8115 2018-02-04 20:37:03 The youths and their godfathers in illegal oil business should know that they are killing the environment and the people silently.
8116 2018-02-04 20:37:00 Just saw a first for me...a cut off motor oil container being used as a junction box cover.
8117 2018-02-04 20:36:58 While we are shipping oil to the east, gasoline prices at the pump have soared.
8118 2018-02-04 20:36:51 Forwarding this to OUR President from a truck driver on Facebook.....We the truck drivers need his help. We are pumping more and more oil and the price of fuel is starting to skyrocket again. Shouldn't be more than 75 cents a gallon. PLEASE HELP.
8119 2018-02-04 20:36:49 Fresh face, then smother it with coconut oil
8120 2018-02-04 20:36:49 Over last week (ending the 2nd of February 2018)

8122 2018-02-04 20:36:25 Bought some CBD oil in drop for to see if it will help our dogs with their anxiety and their old age pains hopeful that it helps.
8123 2018-02-04 20:36:23 The pot roast is easy though. Pan fry the beef in olive oil and butter until it’s just brown then set it aside and use the oil butter to fry a whole yellow onion and a whole garlic and add tomato paste, little potatoes and water and put the  back in and simmer for hours.

8125 2018-02-04 20:36:10 Humidifiers work wonders for me but I also use oil defusers and the scent of Orange helps
8126 2018-02-04 20:36:09 In my opinion the changes made the team more porous,removing Rabiu Ali degraded the depth and little confidence in the team.
8127 2018-02-04 20:35:47 BS, your country is a saboteur and a thief, right now you are stealing oil in the ME. Keep learning from the lies of Hollywood and MSM. 

We Chileans do not need to go to your Shithole. 

By the way, "America" ​​is the name of the continent, even this has been stolen by you.
8128 2018-02-04 20:35:42 What’s your stance on oil? Vaping? That’s what I do usually

8130 2018-02-04 20:35:18 I need some real good coconut oil
8131 2018-02-04 20:35:17 Is this for removing makeup or just general cleansing?  I use coconut oil and micellar water to remove makeup and then clean.  I've sensitive skin too and it does the trick for me, but everyone's different.
8132 2018-02-04 20:35:08 I need an oil pen lol
8133 2018-02-04 20:35:03 BC isn't trying to block it, just protect IT'S coastline. If the coastline can't be protected from oil spills it's BC's problem, not Canada
8134 2018-02-04 20:35:01 Or is the snake oil actually being peddled by those in the Treasury who compile these economic forecasts which appear, judging by their lack of accuracy, to fall into the wild stab in the dark category?  
8135 2018-02-04 20:34:46 It does, but that's at least in part because adding bergamot oil to tea wasn't a great idea in the first place...
8136 2018-02-04 20:34:25 Holy oil
8137 2018-02-04 20:34:10 Coconut oil is the best!
8138 2018-02-04 20:33:58 CALIFORNIA BRAND OLIVE OIL...AMONG OTHERS. I SEE MORE AND MORE WEGS BRANDS, AND MOST ARE VERY GOOD BUT U CAN'T JUST OFFER WEGS BRANDS.

8141 2018-02-04 20:33:42 I’m thinking dollar might go up and impact a little, but cvx and other oil names seemed to be unjustly hit. I’m definitely buying rig here at $10
8142 2018-02-04 20:33:41 Petro is a huge scam. Oil already belongs to China
8143 2018-02-04 20:33:38 هذه مستوى ال سعود و دبابيسهم.  ما يقدروا ينكروا حقوقنا و لا يبغوا يعطونا اياها فيلجأوا للتجريم و السب و الشتم.  كل التضليل و الكذب و محاولات التجريم لن تغير حقيقة فساد النظام السعودي و دكتاتوريته و احتكاره للسطة و استيلائه على ثروات البلاد

8150 2018-02-04 20:32:58 Do your oil, bring the receipt and raise hell
8151 2018-02-04 20:32:46 The yield curve predicts higher future prices, based upon lower supply, reducing desire to store oil, placing pressure on the front of the curve (sell now, don't store).  Lower back prices to front, is not a price prediction, it is a supply prediction, it is counter-intuitive.

8157 2018-02-04 20:31:50 it's good to b investigative not just claims' tru out 2011 to 2015 Subsidy was paid 4 Dollars, oil which leads to D position we re, even key players/hailers of previous regime chooses 2 remain mute cos they knew how we arrived at this position' unlike Odas PMB il not sell Nigeria

8162 2018-02-04 20:31:08 He;s been a crook since the 80s. His name has ALWAYS been synonymous with 'snake oil salesmen'.

Unfortunately, many younger people don't know that. They only knew of him from his stupid reality show.

This, is where we are.
8163 2018-02-04 20:31:06 Yes agree ,it's always about access routes for gas /oil , military base etc
8164 2018-02-04 20:31:06 yeah for fucking sure; gave me the car with no oil
8165 2018-02-04 20:30:52 Western governments and private foundations far outpace private enterprises in terms of climate research funding. Oil companies play ball for PR and gov handouts. You seem new at this.
8166 2018-02-04 20:30:48 Or is it you're anti-oil and *nothing* can satisfy you--except keeping the oil in the ground?
8167 2018-02-04 20:30:45 Yes. They make it gross and unmanageable - and it's a really high quality oil. It reacts better to mousse and finishing spray. I have a routine down now that works better than any other I've ever done.

8230 2018-02-04 20:24:31 geo-engineering at any scale is a bad idea.
8231 2018-02-04 20:24:27 I dunno... NATO is water logged with Saudi oil money.
8232 2018-02-04 20:24:00 So are we going back to the days when the Cuyahoga River caught FIRE! Yes, an oil slick on the river - polluted from decades of industrial waste - caught fire on a Sunday in June 1969 near the Republic Steel mill, causing about $100,000 worth of damage to two railroad bridges.
8233 2018-02-04 20:23:51 Ryan's people were 'lawboys' so he didn't grow up on the bottom of the heap. 
He married Oklahoma oil money. 
Lord knows how much he has "appropriated."
8234 2018-02-04 20:23:51 When holding on with your nails

8238 2018-02-04 20:23:11 So they're OK w/ oil coming in by train instead? If the market is there in Asia, that will happen.
8239 2018-02-04 20:23:01 Get out of oil and gas mr Wood if there is none left
8240 2018-02-04 20:22:55 Entirely plausible. John is constantly weighing furthering his own agenda vs giving Trump ANY appearance of a win. The hate is Strong!!

8245 2018-02-04 20:22:11 30% poverty rate, no hospital, the only department store closing in March (Kmart). Booming heroin use.   It's a failed town, and local businesses owners profit (they're the politicians) and the oil companies profit. The people die.
8246 2018-02-04 20:22:11 Not to mention, "having more flexibility" after the election. And the eastern Europe missile defense systems Obama canceled. Biggest of all - Obama's hindrance of US energy production gave Russia premium prices for its oil and gas. Trump is killing Putin on US energy production.
8247 2018-02-04 20:22:10 Just came into Auto Zone and bought oil, I’m finally a true dad

8252 2018-02-04 20:21:11 They kind of forgot to include the oil sands so I'm fairly certain they are not as much as a threat as they think they are.
8253 2018-02-04 20:21:08 Did you mean to ask about oil subsidies?  I’m not sure. . . .considerably different?

8279 2018-02-04 20:16:54 90 ‘/, of Vancouver’s Oil/Gasoline comes from Alberta. Wake Up! Shut down existing pipeline & Vancouver would be paying $8.oo per Ltr or more for gas. Alberta NDP are just playing games for BC NDP friends with a silly (maybe) future electricity deals. Go buy more from Trump

8334 2018-02-04 20:10:07 Also another thing - if you oil it before you put it in the oven and it's the last thing on top, it'll crisp up and get all crunchy. And possibly burn but if you get it out while it's crunchy that's fun too.
8335 2018-02-04 20:09:45 Getting my oil changed at Mr.Lube and not understanding a single word after they tell you what they did lol
8336 2018-02-04 20:09:42 That’s their right seeing how Putin is having his toy soldiers aid Assad in slaughtering civilians. Can’t wait to put his air bases there and secure oil pipelines in the East. Very stragetic move getting involved helping Assad, plan goes back years. Fighting ISIS was an excuse.
8337 2018-02-04 20:09:35 now is the perfest time to buy oil futures since the price is set to increase as a result of OPEC agreeing to extend their productiom cuts through 2018
8338 2018-02-04 20:09:32 Sounds like someone who is screaming about something that detracts from the fact you and your family have lied to the America people ....SAD! 70% of the AMERICAN people know the truth ; your a fish oil salesmen at best!

8345 2018-02-04 20:08:16 Those are ppl frustrated beyond belief by being used by yet another snake oil salesman to get into office. He broke every promise to them. Why wouldn't everyone stand up to that? Do you really think he's going to honour anyone else's issues? If so, why?

8349 2018-02-04 20:07:57 You can do both! When you put it on prebake it wilts a bunch like spinach and its pepper flavors diminish. Post, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice, makes for a really fresh, herby, finisher.
8350 2018-02-04 20:07:55 Cutting oil imports is a weak measure. USA should advice all its citizens to leave Venezuela by July 15, avoid travel @Bensade @ReutersVzla
8351 2018-02-04 20:07:51 Crisco would have been better.    Motor oil is a tougher stain to remove.  But it doesn’t matter to inebriated fans.

8361 2018-02-04 20:06:23 So change the name and change the information to be a tax on fossil fuel pollution. It will amount to same thing, people aren't buying oil pollutions when we can do it green solutions. We a tired of being poisoned by the fracking, the leaky pipelines and poisons in air and water.

8392 2018-02-04 20:03:02 I retweeted this earlier. It’s better than motor oil but there’s lots of things that are “biodegradable” that we don’t need to be washing into our rivers.

8493 2018-02-04 19:51:05 No it’s dried.  You pour the oyster crackers in a bowl, drizzle like a Tbs of vegetable oil and get them coated, then pour over the dried ranch dressing packet and mix together with your hands.
8494 2018-02-04 19:51:01 Absolutely, I’ll take this one for you. You have to suck the oil out and deflate the air bags before you trade it in. Just drop it off at my house and I’ll take care of it for you. They don’t last as long as they use to.
8495 2018-02-04 19:50:59 Salt, pepper, olive oil, and bake. We chop them up into small pieces. So good. Sadly I live up north so really harder to get.
8496 2018-02-04 19:50:55 La Roche-Posay Toleriane Double moisturizer is surprisingly good. Great for dealing with cold to hot, dry air. Works great under Argan oil.

Don't use too much though. It will ball up on you.

8519 2018-02-04 19:47:35 He said on NFL network that he's from the Midwest and wouldn't mind going back..... just stop. And yes he was specially being asked about CLE. He's about the $, he's a snake oil salesman. Look it up. He sold something and you bought it no returns refunds or exchanges.
8520 2018-02-04 19:47:28 I care that demand is slowing & our gov'ts decision are based on old out-dated oil demand projections that even China doesn't use now
8521 2018-02-04 19:47:28 .... my parents died a week after i was born, AT LEAST YOU HAVE ROSE *he growled and started to chug another can of oil*

8523 2018-02-04 19:47:26 once i apply coconut oil to my freshly shaven legs it's over for these hoes
8524 2018-02-04 19:47:17 NO BLOOD FOR OIL.
8525 2018-02-04 19:47:01 Top mandarins accuse Brexiteers of behaving like NAZIS by criticising civil service forecasts and of selling SNAKE OIL. As Goebbels said - accuse your opponents of doing what you are doing.
8526 2018-02-04 19:46:37 I just bought an essential oil that smells like the world of Pandora from Avatar. L O L

8530 2018-02-04 19:45:46 Stir together 1 cup chew with 9 oz daily bread. Add Olive Oil. Boil. Serve on bread
8531 2018-02-04 19:45:30 It's amazing what can happened when innovation is not hampered buy government / big oil... Well done Australia and #teslamotors #ElonMusk
8532 2018-02-04 19:45:29 To everyone saying coconut oil clogs your pores duhhhhh that’s why you use it when your pores are closed  big dummies lmaooo
8533 2018-02-04 19:45:20 No but the linked article didn't list any either. I've never heard or read a sound reason for leaving. I guess that emphasises your debate point: both sides acting like snake oil salesmen.

8535 2018-02-04 19:45:04 Render beef suet instead of bacon and oil would be the one best tweek to make to this solid recipe
8536 2018-02-04 19:45:03 John McCain is much in the same mould. ALWAYS playing the Hero card when the going gets rough and ppl ask REAL questions, want REAL solution
8537 2018-02-04 19:44:57 I need an oil massage
8538 2018-02-04 19:44:47 My eyes are open to the position we’re in to invest and develope in a new energy industry, get away from boom/bust oil, and lead the world.
8539 2018-02-04 19:44:43 It’s true, I’ll never make cookies with singer sewing machine oil, again.
8540 2018-02-04 19:44:42 Palm oil: good, palm kernel oil: bad. I used to work for a food grade tanker transport company, PKO is in many things
8541 2018-02-04 19:44:40 That’s what the oil is meant for 
8542 2018-02-04 19:44:36 Here’s the thing about Greece. Sh!tty economy, banks are out, no garbage trucks, & constant bail outs.

That said, they rule the world with olive oil & their love of metal - more than Germany - and incredibly, every rare piece of vinyl at some point in its life ends up in Athens.
8543 2018-02-04 19:44:27 You want to blame that on leftist ideas, and not the world-wide slump in the oil price? Do you deny the NHS and all the rest of it? Do you know nothing about the hundreds of thousands of homeless people in the US?
8544 2018-02-04 19:44:22 Marcus - so can you let me know what will be the actual benefits of Brexit.  I’m hearing too much hype (snake oil!), and am after some tangible facts.
8545 2018-02-04 19:44:07 This was predicted by UN FAO 20 years ago - water will become more precious than oil
8546 2018-02-04 19:44:04 #TaxScam; tens thousands jobs lost & billions $ lost. Solar Indus takes big hit due to stupid tariff to help oil. Didn’t keep hily effective Fed head for 2d term & interest rates up. Wall St tumbling. @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
8547 2018-02-04 19:43:37 Potatoes roasted in rosemary oil is the best thing ever.
8548 2018-02-04 19:43:31 Making an old recipe of my Grandma’s for a SB party. Oyster crackers, oil, and a packet of dried ranch dressing and mix together.  Trust me it’s like crack.
8549 2018-02-04 19:43:31 The real fight should be for the energy east pipeline.  We import oil at full market price to refine in Montreal and sell Alberta oil at a discount(no pipelines ). Quebec gets a free pass.  Trudeau's making a real mess and Notly was a pipeline protester before she was premier.
8550 2018-02-04 19:43:25 How does one lose an oil tanker? They are not tiny ships.
8551 2018-02-04 19:43:21 There is oil crisis. No fuel. :)))
8552 2018-02-04 19:43:17 No plastic, no gasoline, no diesel, no transport trucks made of anything remotely related to petrochemicals, no natural gas, no heating oil, no asphalt, etc should make it a wonderful place to live in no time...
8553 2018-02-04 19:43:15 Well, I like it! OTOH I found bay oil totally pointless.
8554 2018-02-04 19:43:12 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
8555 2018-02-04 19:43:02 The problem here is that beyond dredging up an event/subsequent reforms over 50 yrs ago, what momentous achievement can he point to?
8556 2018-02-04 19:42:45 Why would they only give me 40 bucks to get an oil change and they know I have a newer model car 
8557 2018-02-04 19:42:38 Yes, they make money of oil. But they are investing in the future instead of clean coal. They have one of the highest oil prices too.

It is indeed a model.

8561 2018-02-04 19:42:15 Wring out all your dog oil from it so I can wear it
8562 2018-02-04 19:42:13 So basically provinces are encouraged to accept provincial welfare instead of pursuing fiscal policies that would encourage private investment i.e. NB and QC developing shale oil and gas? Perfect example of a dysfunctional country.
8563 2018-02-04 19:42:01 It's just stew with palm oil. If you ever find a Sierra Leonean restaurant ask if they have it

8567 2018-02-04 19:41:27 Glad for your parents...But Heir Trump* is a con, snake oil salesman, liar, and a loser. Period!!
8568 2018-02-04 19:41:24 does that mean we can try marijuana oil for skin cancer problem?
8569 2018-02-04 19:41:19 I got some cannabis massage oil this weekend, would you guys watch a show with M and I using it?

8582 2018-02-04 19:40:04 Word of the day: Babassu (n) A Brazilian palm tree, Orbignya martiana, bearing hard nuts that yield an oil similar to coconut oil.
8583 2018-02-04 19:39:58 I know this doesn't sit with the dieting narrative, but its #SuperbOwl Monday, I had to get Chicken Wings.  I figure if I bake them without oil, and flavour with salt/pepper/paprika, and eat nothing else for the rest of the day, they shouldn't be too bad.
8584 2018-02-04 19:39:49 Completely obsessed with tea tree oil lately. Why am I just discovering it 
8585 2018-02-04 19:39:18 Ha ha Tim, when my brother was little he mistook shampoo for sun tanning oil, he tried to get it to lather and kept adding more, took me hours to wash it all out.
8586 2018-02-04 19:39:14 Still an interesting concept.  Can we convert offshore oil platforms into this?
8587 2018-02-04 19:39:01 You think Britain's increasing prosperity over the last 40 years is snake oil? Do you even know what the term 'snake oil' means? How can you sit back and let this happen to my country? You'll all have to answer for this one day, I grow weary of catastrophic ignorance.
8588 2018-02-04 19:38:58 Certainly a better sub than your singer oil.
8589 2018-02-04 19:38:06 اي مررهه

8594 2018-02-04 19:37:20 Would just like to point out that rosehip oil has heeled my face in a  matter of days
8595 2018-02-04 19:37:04 While CO is good for removing heavy makeup, coconut oil is a actually considered comedogenic oil and shouldn’t be used for long periods of time 
8596 2018-02-04 19:36:59 we are in a bad storm glad I am on a wave cutter brutal waves are 50 ft ballast tanks half full baffles prevent some up and down side oil tank sideways slow speed in the drake with priority we cannot meet another ship here width is too wide
8597 2018-02-04 19:36:49 We made our own cryptocurrency that we plan to use when paying for information which is produced every minute by a modern car: oil consumption, location, temperature, and many more. #uservicetoken
8598 2018-02-04 19:36:42 Very crazy . Well , I'd say illegal refining of crude oil in some many areas in Portharcourt rivers state . 
Well , as usual the government is a reactive one . So I'm guessing they'll respond once people start piling up at the hospital with various health issues from this soot
8599 2018-02-04 19:36:39 The dossier suggested Page had contact with Russians and met with Russian oil giant Rosneft - verified. It suggested the Kremlin ran online campaigns targeting American youth - verified. Suggested Trump maintained ties to rich businessmen from Azerbaijan - verified
8600 2018-02-04 19:36:37 As a spec ed teacher I've had training on how to block punches, hold a child's head to my arm so he doesn't pull out flesh when he bites, and how to avoid losing scalp while I wait for someone to oil the kid's hand so it slips from my hair.
8601 2018-02-04 19:36:34 There is this thin sheen of oil on Kiss Me that makes us skeezed out. Like this was written before MeToo. #srfESC

8603 2018-02-04 19:35:46 Would if oil and water mixed
8604 2018-02-04 19:35:37 Could I ask - what oil do you use for chips and do you fry them in a separate fryer from your meat and fish products? Thanks very much
8605 2018-02-04 19:35:18 That's what Patchouli oil does for me. 
8606 2018-02-04 19:35:06 Oil pencils. Cool
8607 2018-02-04 19:34:59 You can’t drink oil or eat money.
8608 2018-02-04 19:34:58 Need to start with the effects the channelled system has had on subsistence in those areas. Delta no longer deposits sediment except in one small area. No land building anymore, just subsistence. Oil withdrawal has only amplified the effects.
8609 2018-02-04 19:34:52 No way…I’ve been using the odacite oil and it’s been firming/lifting but absolutely done nothing for my dark circles

8613 2018-02-04 19:33:59 What did people use before Palm Oil? As a collective whole, try buying things that have none in it.Been a major uptick also in products that have it. Disastrous.
8614 2018-02-04 19:33:59 @kristine_stone Hi Kristine! This is Tammy in Phoenix, may I please hear Midnight Oil with Beds Are Burning if you have time on your show? Thanks! Have a great day!
8615 2018-02-04 19:33:56 All you need to give Russia the power to challenge the USA & world is higher coal & oil prices. That's all it takes to weaken the US. And then control US communications so that you only need to infiltrate one network, not 4 or 10.
8616 2018-02-04 19:33:56 I hope to save up my $1.50 a week and get an oil change in 10 mos....too bad the engine will blow in 8 mos.
8617 2018-02-04 19:33:53 Don't forget to buy the six pack of oil or Motomix and double your warranty.

8619 2018-02-04 19:33:18 Have a fleet? 
If your company signs their fleet of 5 vehicles or more with our commercial account the account will recieve 15% off all oil changes.
8620 2018-02-04 19:33:02 No I live in Alberta. Where we don't burn Saudi oil supporting FGM. Enjoy the crash.
8621 2018-02-04 19:33:01 I'm telling you. Rice has been dangerous to me. Gravy hasn't been helping much, oddly. I just need the rice uniformly quoted in a lubricant. Only oil has been making it better. Just a spoon or two, more oil gives me terrible side effects too.
8622 2018-02-04 19:32:59 Give it to illegals for remittances to test econ impact. 
8623 2018-02-04 19:32:47 His face does look funny.  I actually think he understands.  He just doesn't want gov funding public purpose.  Tax cuts for the wealthy is fine.  As is military spending and oil subsidies, etc...
8624 2018-02-04 19:32:47 Jiffy Lube was having a sale on oil changes for brooms?
8625 2018-02-04 19:32:46 A bath with sweet almond oil is my solution
8626 2018-02-04 19:32:43 I'm not sure as I don't generally shop a Walgreens but Target, Fred Meyer, and Walmart generally carry it, so I would expect Walgreens would. Super Supplement definitely carry it. Sometimes it is just labeled as garlic ear oil as well.

8628 2018-02-04 19:32:39 I went to my local Aldi today and managed to find three cans of chickpeas among a sea of kidney beans at 33p. each. Have just made a vat of hummus with loads of garlic, lemon juice and olive oil at a fraction of the price and it's delicious!

8632 2018-02-04 19:32:25 ok so. who else remember public school nachos with the cheap mystery meat and too much oil but u still were hype for it
8633 2018-02-04 19:32:22 GAS @STIHLUSA @GreenwayEquip. Buy a 6 pack of oil or the Motomix and double your warranty.

8636 2018-02-04 19:32:05 @FDA_Drug_Info Please let those of us with #TrigeminalNeuralgia use CBD oil for our pain.  No other medications work for most of us and we have to have major surgery to attempt to deal with this horrific pain.  Sometimes these surgeries don't work.
8637 2018-02-04 19:32:02 I feel bad for attacking this girl that puts coconut oil on her face but I was just tryna save her
8638 2018-02-04 19:32:01 Like most of the designs, he'd have multiple phases, such as destroying his mask to reveal his true face beneath, before retreating into his shell and firing spikes at you, you'd then have to destroy the oil rig he's standing on to make him fall into the sea 
8639 2018-02-04 19:31:57 Coconut oil is the solution to like, 80% of my problems.
8640 2018-02-04 19:31:48 The thing I've never understood about anti oil mindset is that they are willing to cut income and revenue but not spending/debt. Lets bring in less money from oil and lose jobs, but still spend the same or more.... Yeah, lets see how that goes
8641 2018-02-04 19:31:30 Neither. Faber Castell's polychromos oil pencils 
8642 2018-02-04 19:31:05 That sounds perfect! Also, you need to make rosemary oil. It's delicious.
8643 2018-02-04 19:31:01 Beyond the initial 1 million $, no mention of funding. To give away $1 you have to tax more thn $1. Poorly designed experiment
8644 2018-02-04 19:30:58 hey y’all better start appreciating baby oil
8645 2018-02-04 19:30:57 And then there's the EU Parliament's ban on the use of Palm oil for biofuels - a controversy that gets spicier and spicier by the day.
8646 2018-02-04 19:30:53 It’s hydraulic fluid not motor oil and that stuff is extremely flammable
8647 2018-02-04 19:30:46 Yes Carmen also uses that one as well as sweet almond oil,   oil is excellent for most uses
8648 2018-02-04 19:30:33 @MirrorCeleb I will rather go for the Cannabis oil.
8649 2018-02-04 19:30:21 Alaskans own 43,500 shares of JAPAN PETROLEUM EXPLORATION CO, worth $995,078. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in JAPAN.
8650 2018-02-04 19:30:18 In conclusion. 
Salah is far too good to stay at the Scousers next season and Our ‘Arry won’t stay with Spuds when they fail again. It’s a bloody shame the oil’s run out and our Sheikh has got fed up 
8651 2018-02-04 19:30:14 Perhaps you have forecasted when oil consumption will stop its year over year growth and we will reach peak oil?  Because if so, you should let everyone know...
8652 2018-02-04 19:30:04 willy has worked at c200 probably since the cb oil? idk my grandfather worked w/ him and he was in like high school or whatever so he's been there for a while. he mans the squeegee! and pushes the nets to the sides during intermissions and fixes the nets if they're knocked off

8663 2018-02-04 19:28:57 Beard oil, day 2: Ali claims to be able to tell a difference. Can't tell if she's serious or patronizing me. My face smells like citrus and I don't hate it.
8664 2018-02-04 19:28:56 I can't think of a better term for vegetable oil other than 'ultra-processed'.
8665 2018-02-04 19:28:28 On The Road Lube is the next generation of oil changes in the North West Louisiana and East Texas areas. We are the change that comes to you. Mobile oil change service offering all the amenities that your average quick lube shop offers just mobile.
8666 2018-02-04 19:28:23 Olive oil + salt + Nutella is always a safe bet!

8668 2018-02-04 19:28:16 Ya. Like the Russian conspiracy that you’ve been running with for over a year. All based on classified IC “assessment”.  No logic. Stock market boom. 2 million new jobs. Illegals down.  Oil production all time highs, tax cuts. Cuz of Russia. Calling us lunatics??  Illogical moron
8669 2018-02-04 19:28:06 I hate it when we order a "sharing" platter. And it comes and I'm like "oh, this is for 2 people? It's hardly a platter it? It's 4 bread rolls and some olive oil in a fuckn shot glass"
8670 2018-02-04 19:27:59 A slow cooker? Lazy much, get some chef skills food made fresh is best, wee tip for the dough for the pizza get sun dried tomatoes and use the oil from them in the dough instead of just olive oil, it makes the pizza that much better, then use the tomatoes as part of the topping.
8671 2018-02-04 19:27:58 I don't know; but, Russia and China are getting a, "pass," with respect to UN Sanctions on North Korea.  They both are sending NK thousands of barrels of oil, and, food-stuffs; and getting away with a denial.  Our own Spies have the proof; but, Trump doesn't seem to care, much.
8672 2018-02-04 19:27:54 you can make a cake with part whole wheat flour instead of refined flour, honey instead of refined sugar, & applesauce/a banana instead of oil & it is considerably “less processed.” i teach this to my 4th graders, the spectrum of processed is nuanced but not that hard to grasp.
8673 2018-02-04 19:27:51 I’ve done something similar but on the run:
Nice multigrain bread, toasted. Spoon some beautiful extra virgin olive oil on top, spread Nutella, sprinkle with dark cocoa and salt.

Not Iron Chef worthy, but yummy.
8674 2018-02-04 19:27:46 Sunnis don’t want US, just corrupt dictators of Sunni countries who do not represent the population want US and give oil to them to stay in power.
8675 2018-02-04 19:27:44 Unfortunately, some of the damage they're doing is not going to be able to be undone. The selling off of our national monuments to the highest bidder for mining/drilling, the oil spills from pipelines poisoning our water, pollution, climate change, etc.
8676 2018-02-04 19:27:43 Dude. Coconut oil takes gum out of hair.
8677 2018-02-04 19:27:41 That’s so cute that you infer such low percentages of jobs rely on fossil fuels.  Why, then, was a drop in oil prices so devastating to those economies? #fakestats
8678 2018-02-04 19:27:24 If you think bout it plastic is made out of oil & oil comes from dinosaurs.  So technically plastic toy dinosaurs are made out of real dinosaurs .
8679 2018-02-04 19:27:21 You're talking as if Kane has retired he could be playing for another 10 years spurs have the best team they've ever had and have the most potential because of our young developing squad unlike the other top teams that can just spend all their oil money at once.
8680 2018-02-04 19:27:09 Olive oil tasted better with my lunch though 
8681 2018-02-04 19:26:56 First,more and more companies are adopting (completely illegal) 'palm oil free' labels on their products. A big UK retailer thinking of it.
8682 2018-02-04 19:26:43 เก็บของไว้ปล่อยอันอื่นนี่เอง นึกว่ามีเหตุอะไรครับ
8683 2018-02-04 19:26:26 I use coconut oil! I can’t remember what it is exactly but I think it’s like a natural antibacterial! I use it every night before bed! Great as a moisturizer as well!
8684 2018-02-04 19:26:21 Put them in enough hot oil and never open the oven until they are ready.
8685 2018-02-04 19:26:21 Probably the same place where the railroads, oil, and interstate highways would have been without taxpayer subsidies.
8686 2018-02-04 19:26:20 In fairness to my auld man- I inherited a high performance engine that only needed an oil change and a bit of remapping
8687 2018-02-04 19:26:15 YES SIS! GET INTO TEA TREA, ALOE VERA AND ROSEHIP OIL IF U HAVENT ALREADY. FR ROSEHIP OIL HEALS SCARS SO WELL ! INVEST !!
8688 2018-02-04 19:26:14 Khomaini and his Regime were the gifts of France and other Western Counties who wanted cheap oil, to the people of Iran. Oil dropped from $30 to $6 a barrel. With it’s growing Sunni Muslim population, France will soon be ruled by Sharia Laws and taste the poison they sent to Iran
8689 2018-02-04 19:26:07 Wouldn't it be funny to hear a US government official say,"We realize the Somali pirates stole the Yuan purchased oil filled tanker but they selling it in USD so if anyone messes with the pirates the US Navy will deal with them.

8692 2018-02-04 19:25:52 NW kind and Claywolf both had significant price drops! Now anyone can get some top shelf oil!
8693 2018-02-04 19:25:52 Oil marketings.
8694 2018-02-04 19:25:45 Lavender is good for relaxation,and I use peppermint oil for headaches.
8695 2018-02-04 19:25:29 Listening and taking Ruto's words seriously is like devil calling you to jump into boiling oil of 200litres.
8696 2018-02-04 19:25:12 To join in on reducing oil consumption?  Because Canadians going after oil companies and pipelines is like obese people going after farmers and grain-filled rail cars.  Or is it just easier to lash out than it is to look in the mirror?
8697 2018-02-04 19:25:03 I use coconut oil (skin, hair).
8698 2018-02-04 19:25:00 #Skincare Ingredient Tip: A macerated/ infused oil describes an oil that has been infused with a chosen medicinal or fragrant plant.
8699 2018-02-04 19:24:44 We are their oil supply and their supply of beef
8700 2018-02-04 19:24:41 i understand i recommend hair oil in damp hair! keep the mushroomyness and frizz gone
8701 2018-02-04 19:24:40 Lol a graph with no source?
Please next you'll show me a page from "Friends of Science". 3% of scientists paid buy big oil push that garbage while 97% of world scientists say it's real. Spread your propaganda else where. We can make fuel from pee, straw, garbage for less.
8702 2018-02-04 19:24:36 Still fascinated at the way rich-world NGOs keep on gnawing away at the palm oil bone! There's a lot going on at the moment!
8703 2018-02-04 19:24:30 U was so completely into giving Rich the Tax's that you ignored our infustrature Crumble an we've had Train wrecks full of Oil/Train Wrecks with Congress on Them. Stores Closing/Plants Closing/Fire's/Floods/Hurricane an still the poor people of Puerto Rico in Dire need of help!
8704 2018-02-04 19:24:29 me: guess i'll get my oil changed today
oil place i wanted to go to: lol we closed fuq u
8705 2018-02-04 19:24:29 True I believe I read somewhere the peak oil passed around 2 years ago, the franking supply is meant to reverse the decline but it will be against the public will.
8706 2018-02-04 19:24:07 Random? I'm talking about crimes involving Trump that the FBI ignores. There are lots and lots of them. When was the last time you heard a news report about Trump-UAE or Trump-Genie Oil?

Ever hear of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition?
8707 2018-02-04 19:24:06 Good night time eye cream/oil recommendations?
8708 2018-02-04 19:23:43 Everything Trump/Fox/RW media say is designed to be emotional testosterone for Trump’s impotent supporters. Everything.

The Wall
Coal
Guns
Demonizing immigrants
Threatening Iran/NK
Oil vs wimpy Solar 
Anti-BLM
Anti-feminist

All to make resentful, impotent people feel powerful.
8709 2018-02-04 19:23:34 That is an environmental hazard, should be vegetable oil!
8710 2018-02-04 19:23:32 I had a kitchen accident this morning. Flipping salmon and I splashed hot butter and oil on my face. Could have been bad but seems I escaped permanent injury and it doesn’t really hurt too bad anymore. Missed my eyeball too.
8711 2018-02-04 19:23:32 i went on youtube to find reviews on this wild growth oil and i go to this girls page bc her hair growth was crazy, click on the video and what do you know : its the chick my ex cheated on me with.  God’s sense of humor is really something.
8712 2018-02-04 19:23:30 The GOP has most likely been “partnering” with Russia since 2010 with cash, targeted social media propaganda, voter hacking etc.  Corresponds perfectly with the rise of the tea party, racism, and climate change denial.  The NRA and oil lobby are perfectly aligned with Putin.
8713 2018-02-04 19:23:24 Just had roast potatoes as shown on @thismorning and they were scrummy. Instead of parboiling, put them in oven with foil over for 15-20 mins, then cook as usual....using Maris Piper and olive oil. OMG crispy and tasty as!! 
8714 2018-02-04 19:23:22 It’s the bio oil!!  thanks baby
8715 2018-02-04 19:23:14 Apparently, the worst thing you can be on the @cavs is a TEAM FIRST guy like @drose & Jeff Green.

Because with @TyronnLue the SQUEAKY WHEEL gets the oil.
8716 2018-02-04 19:23:13 Just butting in,    I use sweet almond oil for everything.     Cleanser,    moisturiser,  shower gel,    right now on the scar on my knee  
8717 2018-02-04 19:23:11 Are you asking where would oil and gas be without tax subsidies? That’s a great question, Grover!
8718 2018-02-04 19:23:09 Humble Brag: I was acquired by Standard Oil of New Jersey in September 1959 and merged with its parent to become Exxon Company, USA in 1973.
8719 2018-02-04 19:23:07 Sorry but  UK has been a net importer of crude oil since 2005.
8720 2018-02-04 19:22:47 Need some oil on it ;P
8721 2018-02-04 19:22:42 My favorite thing about eating something with truffle oil in it is feeling for the rest of the day like I made out with a mushroom
8722 2018-02-04 19:22:40 Not in Congress. Oil industry guy. And Trump campaign.
8723 2018-02-04 19:22:35 First oil painting ever & I’ve had 6 meltdowns . Still loving the piece though lol .
8724 2018-02-04 19:22:34 The GOP has most likely been “partnering” with Russia since 2010 with cash, targeted social media propaganda, voter hacking etc.  Corresponds perfectly with the rise of the tea party, racism, and climate change denial.

8725 2018-02-04 19:22:23 if the oil companies gave him another slush fund, i am sure he would permit offshore drilling. #ncpol #ncga
8726 2018-02-04 19:22:21 I've just checked. You can find the product I'm using on Amazon UK. May I suggest you to look for Kneipp Almond Blossom bath oil. I'm thoroughly using Kneipp's products, they're very effective...
8727 2018-02-04 19:22:14 Nope but I’ve had these fibres that you shake on after beard oil helps with patches (picking habit)
8728 2018-02-04 19:22:13 2018 is going to be the year the masses discover rosehip and jojoba oil
8729 2018-02-04 19:22:03 I think I might like working at an Oil Change place. At least for a day

8735 2018-02-04 19:21:49 Select oil, then Heavy Hitters or Brass knuckles. But Select is King.
8736 2018-02-04 19:21:46 @allwineaside @BrookeAWA I'm using Coconut oil in my coffee.. actually enjoy it.. and reduced tummy fat results are pending... thx Kim #KimIsRatings 
8737 2018-02-04 19:21:41 Two words: Castor oil.
8738 2018-02-04 19:21:32 #Oilers You know that right shot d the Oil could use? He wears #26 and plays for the Montreal Canadiens. In what world did MacT think Petry wasn't worth a multi-year contract? #sweetmotheroflord
8739 2018-02-04 19:21:21 New technologies can make #Africa’s oil and gas business more competitive, and therefore able to make better use of our valuable resources. @Centurion_Law
8740 2018-02-04 19:21:12 Sometimes i hear my ancestors cheer,sing & dance around a fire place,well built bodies,dressed in leather skins,skin glazed with olive oil,humility of an alpha lion,i quietly listen to the stories of stars,of kingdoms,of legacies,of honour,of loyalty...I am a son of Africa 
8741 2018-02-04 19:21:09 I cannot believe that republicans are defending Page! There is a reason he was being investigated BEFORE he was part of the trump campaign. There are 19 people on trump's team with CLOSE ties to Russia & most of them are tied to the oil industry!
8742 2018-02-04 19:20:59 @drdrayzday CeraVe PM versus Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Oil Free moisturizers. I’ve been using CeraVe with no problems but I’m beginning Differin tonight and just wonder if you think one is better than the other during use of adapolene.
8743 2018-02-04 19:20:58 Naah, she is just a conscious charlatan and a bully that thinks that people will buy the snake oil that congress is trying to sell!
8744 2018-02-04 19:20:51 How do you cook calamari? Well I mean how do you cook squid? Do I need oil?
8745 2018-02-04 19:20:42 WAIT... This is how things unfolded: Mossadek is elected PM; nationalizes Iran's oil. Brit & US intel agencies overthrow him. People revolt. Shah leaves Iran. In the melee, an exiled cleric lands from PARIS! People's anger at economic enslavement becomes an "Islamic Revolution".
8746 2018-02-04 19:20:42 I’m a 32 year old software engineer. Doubtful I am about to go enlist to fight a pointless war in the middle east so greedy oil execs can pat themselves on the back.  Win the battle of bringing our troops home.
8747 2018-02-04 19:20:34 Our local vicar has made a commitment to buy all stationary from local post office /stationers rather than internet. Will no doubt cost a bit more #MoneyWhereMouthIs

8749 2018-02-04 19:20:15 If coal and oil paid a reasonable sin tax, @Tesla could do this for the US too.
8750 2018-02-04 19:20:06 Hopefully local content priorities will ensure that #African workers will be fully equipped for the African digital oilfield and able to create new solutions for the local oil and gas industry.
8751 2018-02-04 19:19:58 @OfficialSPGB Have u people ever been to a socialist country? Try Venezuela first. You’ll love that socialist society. Socialism has worked very well there. A rich oil country that has turned into one of the worse countries  in the world for its citizens.
8752 2018-02-04 19:19:56 Electric car paired with a PV charger would be ideal. That's my goal. Tech is quickly developing. Remember that both the oil industry & electric generation & grid were only developed with heavy investment by the govt. Lets support our innovators.
8753 2018-02-04 19:19:52 G. O. D. 's snake oil analage on Peston hit the spot too.
8754 2018-02-04 19:19:49 Yup ... that's what I was wondering too.
8755 2018-02-04 19:19:30 Serious question - are politicians being lobbied by car & oil companies to delay life-saving easy fixes for trains, because train crashes are good for their business?
8756 2018-02-04 19:19:25 @coopukfood do your own brand chocolate bars have palm oil in?
8757 2018-02-04 19:19:24 It’s only 11 and I’ve already got an oil change, cleaned the inside of my car, put away my laundry, and now rocky and I are on a walk to th  dog park. #productive
8758 2018-02-04 19:19:23 Sigh. Yet more snake oil on BBC #countryfile

8761 2018-02-04 19:18:59 What do you do with the clove oil? I have some gauze I could put it on and put over the wound but I’m scared! Xx
8762 2018-02-04 19:18:54 So far my grandma is doing worse in hospice and my grandpa wants someone to order him hemp oil and an egg sitter. 

When I was a kid this isn’t what I thought adulthood would be.
8763 2018-02-04 19:18:50 A couple of drops of slightly warmed mullein oil into your ear for 5 to 10 minutes once or twice a day.
8764 2018-02-04 19:18:46 I am pretty sure it’s not compoundable so just don’t get how this happens.
8765 2018-02-04 19:18:41 I may need that coconut oil. 
8766 2018-02-04 19:18:31 my tummy hurt for ten minutes after eating some weird tasting olive oil & my extremely reasonable response was to eat several medicated gummies woo boy
8767 2018-02-04 19:18:28 If a could only have one meal for the rest of my life I’d 100% get the rosemary olive oil bagel with garden veggie cream cheese from bruggers
8768 2018-02-04 19:18:15 Good on Sajid Hassan for outing his honest and brave hair transplant horror story. Con men will prey on your insecurities so watch out!
8769 2018-02-04 19:18:15 This is long overdue.  Oil in NOT the fuel of tomorrow and should no longer be the fuel we support.  It is no sustainable, pipelines destroy our landscape, and the only ones prospering are the wealthy. #renewables #cleanenergy

8775 2018-02-04 19:16:54 Pepsi’s conflict palm oil is driving rainforest destruction and the extinction of already endangered animals like orangutans, tigers, and elephants. Workers in the palm oil industry are paid unethically low wages, and many don’t have adequate health and safety protection.
8776 2018-02-04 19:16:51 Yeah sure, Oil empire. Where were you when Leicester won it. We've got better revenues, better value for spending, your point isn't valid for this season at all.
8777 2018-02-04 19:16:46 Not an issue you can use it as bath oil as it's very liquid, it blends easily. Sweet almond oil is a good one as it stays longer on your skin. I've just had a bath with it
8778 2018-02-04 19:16:46 You have just as much credibilty as the "vested interests" you rail against.

Your founder is literally an employee of the oil industry.
8779 2018-02-04 19:16:45 If it’s reached terminal now, the best thing you can do is wait. As you get older it’ll get longer. In the meantime, you can use a comb to train your stache to grow in the direction you want, and keep it moisturized with beard oil.

8780 2018-02-04 19:16:41 3.Take the world’s primary energy 2014, 13.700 MTOE, equivalent of 19,5 km3 of crude oil, on my 40 cm globe a cube with a side of 0,07mm. Hard to believe THAT could cause any trouble, but still it does. My point: human minds are unfit to comprehend big numbers.
8781 2018-02-04 19:16:20 Ask @reeceking_  apparently he’s wash 3 times a day with water only and 2 or 3 drops of bio oil.
8782 2018-02-04 19:16:16 Wow, you named the oil well after the animals it will kill when it leaks...I guess Black Death was already taken...invest in Green Energy Brothers & Sisters, divest from this nightmare industry now... #Divest #Resist #WaterisLife
8783 2018-02-04 19:16:10 So apparently there's an oil rig moving around table bay that maybe conducting seismic surveys. We were talking about it just yesterday. May be the reason these whales wanted to beach. Really sad.

8789 2018-02-04 19:15:29 I say we Reclaim the 800 million dollars SOROS pulled from OUR economy & invested in THEIR oil to help support the millions of Americans HE promised to "help" over the years.Give HIM a taste of Redistribution!  Brandish him for the international criminal that he is.
8790 2018-02-04 19:15:28 The deep state is real.  I learned this from George Tenet's uncle.  The bankers, multinational oil corporations, military industrial complex, etc. control the whole country through the CIA and now the FBI as we are finding out.

8792 2018-02-04 19:15:22 Oil also weakened then too which cuts our trade deficit dramatically and helps to boost the dollar

8795 2018-02-04 19:14:55 I don’t really smoke weed anymore, I’ve only been into oil pens & i got a new cartridge for it yesterday & it tastes like blueberry.

8799 2018-02-04 19:14:10 Any idea what’s causing it? I had really bad ear ache for about a month last year and turned out it was just ear wax. Cleared it up with olive oil

8801 2018-02-04 19:13:29 All driving jobs will be automated in 10 years. Oil drillers? Drones guys! I know, thinking about the future is hard.
8802 2018-02-04 19:13:19 In 8 years of BO I never remember any business making big investment in the USA like with Trump. I only remember him shaking down BP for Billions when they had that oil ring blow up. That’s all he did. The unlimited power of Govt shaking down a Corp. Then celebrating it.

8806 2018-02-04 19:12:37 They should also teach things like: 

-how to file your taxes
-how to change the oil in your car


8807 2018-02-04 19:12:33 Worked 12 hours. Oil change. Laundry. Shopping done and now cooking. Busy weekend

8809 2018-02-04 19:12:22 Hope they carry his snake oil hair tonic at the prison commissary.
8810 2018-02-04 19:12:20 Dotard’s as dirty as a diaper & it’s pathetic how seemingly patriotic citizens would defend this lying disgraceful clown & his career long self serving scam family. Everyone knows he’s a sociopathic narcissistic snake oil shill. But. He’s. Not. Her. Or black. #TrumpCrimeFamily 
8811 2018-02-04 19:12:13 Fascinated that @Apple store has taken appointments  across 2 days & over 4 hours to confirm I needed & then actually replace my #iphone battery, while @pepboysauto changed my car's oil, replaced the headlights & windshield wipers in less than 2 hours.
8812 2018-02-04 19:12:08 And have you ever tried slices king oyster mushrooms? I sampled some that were grilled in a skillet in sesame oil and served with hoisin sauce. Phenomenal to say the least.

8814 2018-02-04 19:11:51 I use: 
-Cleanse: Nourish Organics Aloe and Watercress Moisturizing Cleanser ($9)
-Tone: diluted ACV (1 part Apple Cider Vinegar and 2 parts water) ($5-7)
-Moisturize: Rosehip Oil (8 drops) and Shea Butter (for colder days) ($8-$12)
8815 2018-02-04 19:11:45 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
8816 2018-02-04 19:11:32 Emma's right...with this brand...you could use (forgive me for the blunt translation) shower oil. It's like shower gel but it deeply moisturises your skin. It was my dermatologist's advice...it might work as well for you
8817 2018-02-04 19:11:27 Looks good, were doing wings, skins, meatballs. Nicole is making traditional buffalo and hoisin and sesame oil. Will try the chili next weekend.

8821 2018-02-04 19:11:17 @CBCAlerts so the government approved offshore oil drilling on Thursday, still haven't seen a single news story about it from you or @CTVNews  , @globalnews  , or any of the papers. @jkenney @AndrewScheer
8822 2018-02-04 19:11:13 Actually the worst is just outside of Los Angeles, Venezuela is next & is flat broke so has NO environmental protections & Nigeria is not broke but has little regard for the environment & Eastern Canada imports oil by tanker from both those places. Make sense to you? Me neither!
8823 2018-02-04 19:11:07 Be all out decadent-truffle oil and salt

8831 2018-02-04 19:10:15 The snake oil salesman accuses other people of being snake oil salesmen the political elite and the millionaire elite are desperate to keep us in the European empire for their own gain at our expense
8832 2018-02-04 19:10:12 also does motor oil in the streets of philly sound like a good idea when there’s gonna be a full on riot win or lose? they want philly to burn to the ground

8835 2018-02-04 19:09:58 You agree that the last 20 years has bad for Nigeria, but in years of low oil prices and terrorism, you want Nigeria to turn to Norway in 3 years. You should examine your mental health.

Make a foccacia. As soon as it's out of the oven. 
Spread Nutella on top.

Icing sugar. 
Drizzle olive oil if you want. 

You're welcome.
8840 2018-02-04 19:09:39 Folks may want to read up on the National Oil Policy. Required Ontarians to subsidize the development of Alberta's oil patch, for years. Confederation goes both ways.
8841 2018-02-04 19:09:28 instead crisco or motor oil  they should lather the poles with pine tar or stick ‘em so they just get stuck and can’t move

8844 2018-02-04 19:09:18 @FoxNewsSunday Trump was merciless pounded by media for saying he was being surveilled last year this time. Also, report how wide the surveillance goes when the 'target' is in touch with others. Spreads like oil on water. they just needed an excuse to turn the dogs loose.
8845 2018-02-04 19:09:14 The oil profit during 8 years of Ahmadinejad was $100 billion which is much more than the entire reign of the two phalavis. The money was wasted in Syria and Lebanon to buy support and mercenaries in Arab streets. Iranians women had equal rights and were never stoned 3/
8846 2018-02-04 19:09:13 I got a back pack for camping, jojoba oil, conditioner, witch hazel wipes, and travel containers for my backpack for $30. Don’t mess with me and my lord and savior @tjmaxx
8847 2018-02-04 19:09:01 "Between 2008 and 2010, a dozen major US corporations—including General Electric, ExxonMobil, and Verizon—paid a negative tax rate"

If you remember there was a credit crunch and oil price crash

8849 2018-02-04 19:08:36 For every $1 PMJT commits to subsidizing/fighting for oil there should be $2 committed to green energy. Within a generation fossil fuel will be not be used to the extent it is now. Green is our future; PMJT must invest in Canadians future.

8857 2018-02-04 19:07:55 The gold paleted, mother of all FTAs, the SM, would be easy. If only it wasn't for the 'snake oil' selling brextremists and their gullible friends.

8860 2018-02-04 19:07:35 2 individuals,  KB and khloe, were asked this same question ; if tobi has 2 puff balls and gave 2 puff balls to Cee-C,  how many puff balls has tobi.

8872 2018-02-04 19:06:28 How to successfully sell snake oil. Tell the world those that know you'e a venal lying wormtongue are snake oil sales people.

This man should have his knighthood removed.
8873 2018-02-04 19:06:20 anymore cuz I learned my hair needs to breathe possibly more than others but when I do oil my scalp I use super growth grease it’s the yellow grease n I’ve been using n loving that grease for years. I try not to mix a lot of diff hair products I keep the same regimen that works
8874 2018-02-04 19:06:14 I thought the 2016 sell off was sparked by the decline in oil prices, not the other way around as the wsj author implies. My understanding is that the decline in the oil price caused a sell off in junk bonds, which were oil heavy, and that led to the equity sell off.

8878 2018-02-04 19:05:42 Thank you 
8879 2018-02-04 19:05:42 Is that similar to the "snake oil" he sold us under Blair? Not a man to be trusted: a civil servant - says it all.
8880 2018-02-04 19:05:41 Would be a problem, but they put motor oil on everything in the city so I think we are good
8881 2018-02-04 19:05:35 That 19k Ryan takes home wasn't hanging out in a bank account somewhere. Taxes are a membership fee for a shared society. For $200 in a year I can pay half an oil bill. But times that by all American households and we can accomplish a lot more. 25200000000 is a lot more effective

8887 2018-02-04 19:05:17 I would imagine Trump's stated goal of America being energy independent would have struck fear Into the heart of Putin, Russia's economy being big time dependent on oil. He would have loved Hillary's continuance of Obama's war on American Energy
8888 2018-02-04 19:05:08 Question No. 8 was typical of these surveys — loaded and meaningless. It asked whether big oil and big business have more influence with Congress than conservationists and scientists?
8889 2018-02-04 19:05:04 except that trump doesn't gaf about trains. he wanted them shut down. his idea of "infrastructure" is oil and gas pipelines.
8890 2018-02-04 19:05:03 The 2 phalavis build Iran from the ashes of destruction to where in 1978 Iran was almost a modern state and a viable wealthy middle class  with millions in reserves and they did that with only $20 a barrel of oil. The Islamic mullahs have done nothing with $100 a barrel of oil 2/
8891 2018-02-04 19:05:02 How's all that offshore oil drilling that you approved on Thursday going, Hypocrite Climate Barbie!
8892 2018-02-04 19:05:01 But I recommend As I Am cowash, Mega Growth deep conditioner, which I’m using th 2 products now n i love it. I need to get sum Shea Moisture Manuka shampoo which I heard good things about that product as well. As far as oil goes I don’t like to drench my hair in a lot of oils
8893 2018-02-04 19:04:54 I have no clue. This doesn't even make any sense to me.

8898 2018-02-04 19:04:27 Garlic in olive oil and bacon frying are the smells of the gods.
8899 2018-02-04 19:04:27 The  citizens of Venezuela are not benefiting from the oil and gas industry. The spoils of oil are going to the ruling class and military. Slap sanctions on and get going already. Apparently we are swimming in oil so little risk to the upside...
8900 2018-02-04 19:04:20 That's what I figured, just wanted to make sure with the immunostimulant properties and all. My brain is a mess lately but so is my immune system. I had a psychotic reaction from Nigella sativa cold-pressed oil
8901 2018-02-04 19:04:17 Use coconut oil, it really helps.

8903 2018-02-04 19:04:11 With all these hoes everywhere you'd think as a nation we'd be more into agriculture than oil. 
8904 2018-02-04 19:03:53 …dish. drizzle with olive oil. put in oven at 400 until it’s all sort of collapsed and roasted. allow to cool a bit & transfer to saucepan…
8905 2018-02-04 19:03:40 Neutrogena oil free acne moisturizer is so nice, it doesn’t break me out and it smells like grapefruits

8907 2018-02-04 19:03:37 Shit. How could I possibly omit the best  follow of them all @BeccaT1120 (please don't hurt me)
8908 2018-02-04 19:03:37 Well start by making emissions targets for all motors. Make them more efficient. Crack down on animal agriculture. It's way worse for the environment than oil and vehicles and manufacturing all combined. Do some research on it, quite interesting.
8909 2018-02-04 19:03:30 Girl same! After the extensions, I had maybe like 10 eyelashes on each eye. But I used castor oil and a serum from VTMN organic
8910 2018-02-04 19:03:25 
8911 2018-02-04 19:03:13 No it will be paid for from Scotland oil no doubt.
8912 2018-02-04 19:03:05 I know y’all need gel and gorilla snot for ya edges on these frontals but please baby, use some dry oil to get rid of the flakes on your hairline and forehead for those with ya frontal too far up

8914 2018-02-04 19:02:57 So is Egyptian magic, I not longer have oily skin. I stay matte through the day after the oil finally absorbs from the cream
8915 2018-02-04 19:02:49 There is no tax on langar.. only ingredients are taxed..ie if you buy ghee, ata, oil, the govt doesn't know the end user, it's only 5% gst like u n I pay.. don't believe too much what's up..check your facts
8916 2018-02-04 19:02:48 I HATE  THE OIL PART SO MUCH

8919 2018-02-04 19:02:31 With about 6000 investment opportunities, oil is the most important mineral ever discovered in the history of mankind.
8920 2018-02-04 19:02:28 i was with my pajamas and my hair full of coconut oil and one of the girls in here is a model like uugh

8922 2018-02-04 19:02:14 Yeah I make pizzas and pastas from scratch a lot, olive oil is a must!
8923 2018-02-04 19:01:56 Reason 1375 of why i will never settle for a man less than my dad. He changed my water pump, my oil, cleaned my truck and brought me home an icee.
8924 2018-02-04 19:01:54 need more coconut oil 
8925 2018-02-04 19:01:52 The Russian oligarchs, who took over after the fall of the Soviet Union, control the oil. Russia depends on oil. It sees itself as destitute without it. Oligarchs seek our downfall, as well as the EU, Ukraine, and others. Oil money. Let's all go solar!
8926 2018-02-04 19:01:42 Boiler is the last part to come. The people installing it have it now, but wanted to come the same day the oil will be delivered, so they can set everything up. Makes sense, else they'd have to come back afterwards and it'd take even longer, & stop them finishing other ppl's work

8931 2018-02-04 19:01:03 His ‘miracle’ is testament to the scientific bounty and material progress brought forth by 200 years of enlightenment government in the Republic. The bastard offspring of his poisonous, snake oil, belief racket are bringing that chapter to a close - what a time to be alive! 
8932 2018-02-04 19:01:02 Sounds like snake oil to me.
8933 2018-02-04 19:00:44 @Deganna as well. (sorry for the mentions everyone, if you tap the arrow you can mute the thread) just want to include as many as I can.

Expect #bitcoin, #Euro and #US #Oil moving into positive territories this week. Their common adversary, US #dollar, is likely losing ground again. That said, #BTC is in fact totally disconnected from #USD.
8935 2018-02-04 19:00:36 This is correct. But those who refine Oil amass greater fortune Vs those who merely possess it. 

Similar to Data - companies possess huge amount of transactional data but those who "refine" it, create insights and "monetize" it for AI will benefit significantly more.  #Watson

8940 2018-02-04 19:00:18 So are authorities putting Tide pods atop these motor oil greased poles in Philly today?
8941 2018-02-04 19:00:16 Johno is  take ur oil boy ur well able to give it
8942 2018-02-04 19:00:12 I think the goal is just fine… The problem is we shouldn’t watch these things in slow Mo… It overemphasizes every little nudge.  I will say, there is no way that was egregious, so given the new mandate...Good goal
8943 2018-02-04 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
8944 2018-02-04 18:59:42 I got an air fryer from Aldi a couple of months ago, I love it to make chips (French fries to Americans) without the trouble of using a deep fryer. I can make them fresh from potatoes and a small amount of oil
8945 2018-02-04 18:59:42 All I'm seeing on this timeline is angry talk about players' legacies and meanwhile Philly cops are coating the light poles with motor oil. We have failed as internet jokesters.
8946 2018-02-04 18:59:39 Seth Davis sells snake oil for real.
8947 2018-02-04 18:59:25 I don’t have creamer so I added a little bit of vanilla extract and coconut oil to my black coffee and it honestly tastes pretty damn good
8948 2018-02-04 18:59:25 Do a hot oil treatment , I was feeling like this too but then I did  mix of stuff last night and it helped
8949 2018-02-04 18:59:19 This Avon body oil is reviving my skin 
8950 2018-02-04 18:59:17 Adjustments to CPI - substitution of oil.  Horse and buddy.  Firewood.

8952 2018-02-04 18:58:45 This is disgusting. We don't need oil, the government knows this but refuse to do what's right for us. We can harness the sun and wind for power. We can grow algae for power. We can change our sewer systems to remove liquids from solids make hydrogen with urine and biogas solids.
8953 2018-02-04 18:58:43 Has anyone ever used Magenesium Oil? Does it really work?
8954 2018-02-04 18:58:40 Number one is oil, number two is vehicles and parts

8956 2018-02-04 18:58:21 That's a fairly well defined wedge. Check out the one in oil. Technicals make up ~30% of what I do...but it's times like these that 30% can be important! Good luck Dale!

8961 2018-02-04 18:58:08 Putin's oil is expensive to drill, and to  complete, Russia need tech only Exon has. Tillerson=Exon, But those pesky sanctions!
8962 2018-02-04 18:58:07 I think @Vangelus has suggest shock oil for stiff joints, but don't quote me on this.
8963 2018-02-04 18:58:01 Nutella aka palm oil in a jar... NOPE. I hate the taste of peanut butter. The smell. The texture.
8964 2018-02-04 18:57:58 If Ronny did, hope he didn't have any clothes or shoes. Those are made of or using oil. Naked bike ride to the coast ?
8965 2018-02-04 18:57:44 Im bored af at work come get an oil change or some shit
8966 2018-02-04 18:57:42 Longest oil change ever.

8968 2018-02-04 18:57:32 @mental_gas dammit
8969 2018-02-04 18:57:32 So true. There is normally a bit of pipe involved in one of those. and some kroil oil or pb blaster.

8973 2018-02-04 18:57:09 I feel the same way about sesame oil. don't let that negativity bring you down.
8974 2018-02-04 18:56:39 Marijuana tea or CBD oil is much better, I don't have a problem weed at all. But smoking it defeats the purpose of its healing properties
8975 2018-02-04 18:56:30 Tuesday, if all goes to plan.

Have to make do with a smaller oil tank for the boiler as they couldn't get the larger one. Should be fine though, just may need filling more often.
8976 2018-02-04 18:56:26 I’ve got coconut oil in my hair and a face mask on.... so right back at ya! Never too early

8979 2018-02-04 18:56:01 I very strongly doubt that you assertion is true for the UK and it would be terrible news for the entire world if it was so because of the horrific ecological damage that oil would contribute to (if it existed...).
8980 2018-02-04 18:56:01 pls explain how 42billion dollars Naija oil money disappeared when you forcibly ruled us. Rogue

8984 2018-02-04 18:55:49 No. Will have suggests “to be acquired.” IMO Africa already has the power but it’s being wielded by outside forces. Gaddafi almost changed that by trying to base the price of oil on gold instead of US$...
8985 2018-02-04 18:55:38 Next time ur sad rub urself down in coconut oil and say “yup, I’m that bitch”
8986 2018-02-04 18:55:37 Kale is tasty when sauteed in olive oil and garlic. Serve with strong drink.
8987 2018-02-04 18:55:25 He has a 2wd with no cab, but does some work in the oil patch on the side and was maybe thinking of upgrading. I think he'll wait
8988 2018-02-04 18:55:01 Just finished Naomi Klein's "No is not enough."  A lot of Trump's circle have a lot to gain from hiking the price of oil. I think I recall reading something about JRM's hedge fund investing in these areas too.
8989 2018-02-04 18:54:51 Hi, we haven’t but it has been tried in the past by other unfortunate people diagnosed! CBD oil does work for so many months but aggravates the tumour for it to come back more aggressive 
8990 2018-02-04 18:54:24 Touting a world class oil spill clean up system without providing line by line details is disingenuous. 1 What will be response time? 2 Will it operate 24/7? 3 How many booms are on hand &where will they be stored? 4 How does cleanup happen in a wild sea? Etc
8991 2018-02-04 18:54:21 Coconut Oil & Water are my best-friends
8992 2018-02-04 18:54:18 Interesting how Standard oil was able to get around the rules with such ease

9003 2018-02-04 18:52:50 Consider this: motor oil is much slicker than Crisco but it is also much more flammable

9007 2018-02-04 18:51:58 the oil price has risen partly due to the devaluation of the $ and partly to winter supply disruption - world is full of oil and not enough buyers
9008 2018-02-04 18:51:53 Actually no. With falling oil prices past few years, Ontario now carries the Canadian economy. Also she is referring to fact that in 2017 the GDP growth of Ontario increased more than G7 countries at a growth of 2.8%.
9009 2018-02-04 18:51:53 Yes. I like that too. Or w tomatoes and lots of pepper and oil.
9010 2018-02-04 18:51:48 Yes we don't have many titles but what the city us doing with motor oil is beyond me

9030 2018-02-04 18:49:31 thanks Doug - I just read his tweet literally about crude oil price - There is too much oil chasing too few customers since US started fracking - supply disruptions always send price up in winter - but I think the rise has more to do with devaluation of $
9031 2018-02-04 18:49:31 lmao I’m a brokie ! They have an argan oil one too it’s normally by the natural hair stuff
9032 2018-02-04 18:49:23 Me either. In the picture, it doesn't even really look like motor oil. I mean it is white
9033 2018-02-04 18:49:19 $ave an unsung hero in the oil game. As the price of oil goes up more north American rigs come online. AVE is in the game of moving those rigs. Huge revenue growth q over q. Sleeper pick.  Take a look!

9056 2018-02-04 18:46:57 the problem isn't oil production, it is oil reduction. oil companies have no plan for reduction of output. they only see growth. The ability for corporations to see the wisdom in decreasing their scale and production instead of failing outright is needed.

9091 2018-02-04 18:43:16 Instead of accusing each other u should thinking over the future of YOUR  country... so many things to do especially in tech and space sector... Oil is over Donald..move forward
9092 2018-02-04 18:43:13 The authentic Mexican recipe for guacamole does NOT contain olive oil! Díos mio.

9097 2018-02-04 18:42:36 Btw, if you haven't heard about removing the oil spot, use Dawn liquid soap, rub it in the area until it foams a little then rinse. Oil gone!
9098 2018-02-04 18:42:35 your tweet was about crude oil price, not all petroleum products
9099 2018-02-04 18:42:26 Oligarchs r rich donors like Kochs Mercers NRA I know Dems r supported by rich donors as well. The ?s r what do u do with the money u get? Do the rich donors have a sense of noblesse oblige? A conscience? LBJ was supported by big oil had Dem majority. I told u abt Great Society!
9100 2018-02-04 18:42:18 Dirty water? I thought it was motor oil
9101 2018-02-04 18:42:18 Bouncing around the field of oil listening to @GhostfaceKillah. Nothing makes a day better!

9108 2018-02-04 18:41:26 I'm glad you were able to get your oil changed. How much snow do you have outside?

9113 2018-02-04 18:40:40 The memo has been such a distraction. A bipartisan agreement on Russian sanctions has been ignored & expired without consequences for this administration? Why? We know he & putin want to begin biggest oil grab in history. Everyone’s just letting this slide
9114 2018-02-04 18:40:39 Makes really good cuticle oil too!

9125 2018-02-04 18:38:56 What do you do with the oil afterwards?
9126 2018-02-04 18:38:56 All the cash that's going to be made will not spent on any spills or whatever. Money is for big oil and others. Not many Indigenous people will see anything but the damages.
9127 2018-02-04 18:38:56 UK is on oil but not gas Danny
9128 2018-02-04 18:38:38 At least the oil place has cookies

9131 2018-02-04 18:38:26 they are with fucking motor oil lmao like wtf
9132 2018-02-04 18:38:25 I never understood why our sandwiches had crusts, when the ones my mom prepared for her bridge parties had NO crusts (btw, we threw all those awful tasting castor oil capsules under the table at breakfast until she stopped giving them to us).
9133 2018-02-04 18:38:22 And, I'm sure that has nothing to do with the $TRILLIONS in subsidies and tax breaks to the oil industry.
9134 2018-02-04 18:38:17 Try chips cooked in avocado oil with Himalayan salt they are SO good
9135 2018-02-04 18:38:13 What time is nig final

No más depender del carbón
Se debe aumentar la educación de calidad y acceso para todos los colombianos sean del estrato que sea, cambiar políticas para un desarrollo rural acabar con los monopolios y fortalecer el agro.

9141 2018-02-04 18:37:19 It's a damned shame they didn't go the same route as Norway and sock away their oil royalties. The Heritage Fund could really have been something but instead it turned into a slush fund. Opportunity gone forever!

9144 2018-02-04 18:36:49 The National Parks being dismantled by our current "Play-Land" government. Who needs our national parks when there's oil to be drilled?
9145 2018-02-04 18:36:44 Everyone wants to feel like they’re smarter than a Philly city worker. “They’re spreading flammable, toxic, oil on the light poles!  It’s gonna burn, call the EPA, hurrr-durrr!”
9146 2018-02-04 18:36:08 It replaces eggs and oil

9150 2018-02-04 18:35:44 Para procesar cada kilo de oro hay que consumir 380 mil litros de agua. 
36 mil KW de energia.

9154 2018-02-04 18:35:22 We're all enamoured w you, but Jack has taken it to powers of "oil". 
9155 2018-02-04 18:35:21 I’m curious gasoline prices are up also. Paul Ryan should be dancing the oil companies are making some nice profits.
9156 2018-02-04 18:35:20 Logan changed my oil, got me new wipers and filled up my tank. I am truly blessed
9157 2018-02-04 18:35:13 I use sunflower oil. But baby oil would probably work
9158 2018-02-04 18:34:54 Should have been a heart attack!
9159 2018-02-04 18:34:43 All I am trying to say is that there has to be some give. BC totally shutting out a path for Alberta oil to make it to Pacific rim countries isn't going to help Canada's economy as a whole. Our dollar's strength does rely significantly on our oil production at the moment.

9161 2018-02-04 18:34:30 i just used the mario badescu cucumber spray in conjunction with rosehip oil & holy crap, my skin is glowing
9162 2018-02-04 18:34:12 Laura mercier oil free tinted moisturizer is awesome for acne prone/sensitive skin and provides decent coverage if you use a beauty blender but it's hit or miss with dry patches but I heard that, that popular tarts one thing or whatever is good for dry skin
9163 2018-02-04 18:34:04 Can I just start dumping my used motor oil on the streets of Philly?
9164 2018-02-04 18:33:58 Oil like baby oil or like olive oil? Also, I really just complain because I find it annoying hahaha but I like soft legs!

9168 2018-02-04 18:33:26 I didn't mind it. The game was over at that point (as with the McDavid misconduct). I wouldn't mind if McLellan cleared his throat at some point & "takes the fine" but it's not his style.
9169 2018-02-04 18:33:21 I just scraped the Crisco of my pants and made breakfasy. Motor oil is a strong move by Philly's Phinest
9170 2018-02-04 18:33:12 Was he the head of the civil service when Blair was selling snake oil to support his arguments for Iraq war?

9172 2018-02-04 18:32:50 My mama loved using pink oil moisturizer on my hair 
9173 2018-02-04 18:32:42 And in an unexpected move, Philly public works have switched from Crisco to Motor oil. Bold strategy, let's see how it works out.
9174 2018-02-04 18:32:39 The wife said applesauce is to replace oil?

9181 2018-02-04 18:31:41 No country can sustain the whole of #Africa so according to this logic I suppose we are all off to Nigeria as it has oil and is the fastest growing economy in Africa currently... SA is buckling to supply already and with its dead economy #Jobs are rare!
9182 2018-02-04 18:31:35 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.

9192 2018-02-04 18:30:46 Trump is stealing our public lands to sell to oil companies. Trump's oil investments and his fossil fuel oligarch cronies will make bank while the heritage of our public lands is stolen by Trump's kleptocracy. #ImpeachTrump
9193 2018-02-04 18:30:14 was clearing up from dinner and had an oil spill BP would be proud of!
9194 2018-02-04 18:30:03 I know of no regular person who dumps oil into the sewer at night. Before it was illegal to do so, most people just dumped it in the back yard and covered it with dirt.

9202 2018-02-04 18:28:44 except that as US & UK are now nett oil exporters thanks to fracking and offshore drilling, this is good news - not so good for EU though

9209 2018-02-04 18:27:40 It may well be, but ignoring facts doesn't help your case.
Whether or not Alberta exports oil has zero affect on climate change. Attempting to restrict supply of an in-demand product benefits only the unscrupulous.
9210 2018-02-04 18:27:35 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
9211 2018-02-04 18:27:33 While I totally agree w/ the environmental side of things, I also see first hand how it affects day to day life in Alberta. Many companies are starting to phase themselves to greener tech (solar, wind, etc) but can't ditch oil overnight. Oil pipelines are still a present reality.

9219 2018-02-04 18:26:32 Coal and oil are poisoning our water and air, these are public health issues not viable sources of energy, only selfish rich executives of dirty energy companies benefit at society's expense.
9220 2018-02-04 18:26:28 We're saying that we should move away from fossil fuels because of their adverse impact on the environment. My point is the oil, gas and nuclear are all more heavily subsidized than renewables; giving them competitive advantage.
9221 2018-02-04 18:26:12 We are forced to live where we are now. I’m certainly not saying ban all fossil fuels. I’m saying let’s have fair and equal funding sources for all fuels to include renewables and allow for the cleanest best source control the market. Gas/oil industry will not let that happen.

9235 2018-02-04 18:24:46 Watching the #Raceofchampions coverage from yesterday. What an absolute shambles of a crowd. Oil dollars clearly at play here
9236 2018-02-04 18:24:41 We're going to need one of those volunteer teams you get cleaning up birds after an oil spill.
9237 2018-02-04 18:24:36 Vitamin E oil is wonderful for dry chapped lips. Use in place of a chap stick or lip balm.
9238 2018-02-04 18:24:32 Ok For you Bye
9239 2018-02-04 18:24:25 I know. I need that oil!
9240 2018-02-04 18:24:12 Lee’s Hoagies, definitely the best. It’s the oil!
9241 2018-02-04 18:24:08 Body shop seaweed oil control gel I want to run to you
9242 2018-02-04 18:23:48 @BostonGlobe can you look into this? Why are we taking Russian oil, which is under sanctions?
9243 2018-02-04 18:23:46 thanks @kennediratcliff for the info on peppermint oil for cramps, WORKS WONDERS 
9244 2018-02-04 18:23:40 Oliver fell off the bike the other day and I ran to pick him up, he was crying and I asked “how did you fall oil?” (Him crying) “I was going so fast!” I then asked are you okay? He grabs me and says “it hurts, it hurts so bad”  lol I love my babies.!
9245 2018-02-04 18:23:35 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
9246 2018-02-04 18:23:23 And now you see why both parties meddle in the middle east. The queen hates buying russian oil. Obama continued what bush started in the middle east. It's been a proxy war since the 80s.
9247 2018-02-04 18:23:10 I believe he's the reason we're where we're at. So much distrust since. He took an honorable and respected man, Gen. Colin Powell, sent him to the @UN with a political CIA Director Tenet, and strung them out with known false intelligence to attack the wrong (oil$) country. #saudi
9248 2018-02-04 18:23:04 Not sure where you live...but we in California do not want to see our beautiful Coast Line littered with Oil Rigs! Put them in Mar a Lago!
9249 2018-02-04 18:22:55 1. I have spent the night at top of half-dome 2. As a little  I played I lived in/wild in/forest & big oil execs would always try to buy the land I lived on 3. I wish I wouldn't have quit piano lessons Tag @JayGreenlinger @ChevalierOPSci @Hell2Teach
9250 2018-02-04 18:22:53 How much does “big oil“ pay into your bloated budget every year?  What happens to the people of NYC If they decide to “divest” from you?  We really deserve better than a pandering incompetent for a mayor.
9251 2018-02-04 18:22:43 I do give one hell of a hot coconut oil massage.
9252 2018-02-04 18:22:40 Bikes don't leak oil, they mark their territory. #quotes
9253 2018-02-04 18:22:21 Re #2 and the gubmint did nothing to get the oil out of the ground, processed and delivered to the gas station.
9254 2018-02-04 18:22:14 U need some special oil to get rid of your rustiness. Ask @chrisJcsgo , maybe he knows someone around the corner J
9255 2018-02-04 18:21:58 @Kimzolciak are there any local boutiques that sell your products? I leave Wed for a 2 week trip and realized I don’t have enough toning oil.  I’m in Alpharetta.
9256 2018-02-04 18:21:58 Data is the new oil. Techie 
9257 2018-02-04 18:21:39 And clean energy is a farse. Don’t be so naive. You Need coal and oil to run the world. You’re being lied to.
9258 2018-02-04 18:21:12 Mucho mas seguro es agarrar un Avion que un tren en U.S...... igual de valido para mover el crude oil.... Mucho mas seguro y eficiente moverlo por pipelines que usando trenes

9261 2018-02-04 18:21:04 You can use some mink oil to condition, moisten, and shine the leather homie!
9262 2018-02-04 18:21:03 You prefer hot oil for your massage?
9263 2018-02-04 18:20:29 The Republicans are just looking pitiful now, as if Trump hyperbole was an actual thing. It works for 30 seconds, maybe a minute, but you then have to keep saying it. If people don't trust you anymore, you just come off sounding like a snake oil salesman. Sad. Not #Winning.
9264 2018-02-04 18:20:27 i smell like coconut oil and candy 
9265 2018-02-04 18:20:24 Bloody America trying to topple another democratically elected leader so that they can put in a puppet who will do their bidding. I wonder if it’s once again do with OIL???
9266 2018-02-04 18:20:17 No! need the whole almond matrix otherwise the almond oil will be absorbed in the upper small intestine --  too soon to get the bifidogenic effects
9267 2018-02-04 18:20:17 @AFishyScientist oak saw this large lab witch compared to him was large as he got close he saw a odd look oil box and poked it several times hearing a bell go off found it funny cause he is a kid dragon  so he kept going
9268 2018-02-04 18:20:12 We will no longer take your poisons. We are no longer your sheep. My federal lawsuit outlines my religious reasons to not take shots. See: Paddock v. Gov. Butch Otter in answers as attached to the CBD oil lawsuit
9269 2018-02-04 18:19:58 How can residents recycle household hazardous waste? I know some convenience centers take oil and gas. But there is nowhere to recycle fertilizers, pesticides, weed killers, or cleaning chemicals. Do we just put them in our household garbage that goes to the landfill?
9270 2018-02-04 18:19:49 PS - I grew up I Calgary, working in Oil and Gas, and was totally brainwashed by the industry too. Then I moved away and saw things from a different perspective and woke up!
9271 2018-02-04 18:19:49 Yes, and they were frozen when I put them in. I tossed them in olive oil before I put them in though.
9272 2018-02-04 18:19:42 .if the oil companies could pick up all the oil and deposit it in china skipping the royalties, jobs and taxes all in one fell swoop, they certainly would. they do not care about Canada our citizens or the social & economic stability of them. #cdnpoli
9273 2018-02-04 18:19:35 Milner says considers Venezuela oil sale restrictions, sanctions
9274 2018-02-04 18:19:29 (And, AFAIK, oil price effectively sets the ceiling price for other fossil fuel sources)
9275 2018-02-04 18:19:24 Need to ask patron saint of olive oil cake @geendatz? Meredith, what do you think?
9276 2018-02-04 18:19:23 Clean Energy is the future, more efficient and cost effective solar and wind energy alternatives are apart of a multi billion dollar Industry with millions of jobs. The oil and coal industries are both dying.
9277 2018-02-04 18:19:21 Though HM also received a ruby and diamond flower brooch as a gift in 1948 when she launched an oil tanker in Glasgow.....
9278 2018-02-04 18:19:13 @Wegmans going too far in replacing brands with your own. I noticed top rated California Olive Oil no longer on shelves.
9279 2018-02-04 18:19:12 So it continues. I thought I had a routine call. Abandon Boat on side leaking fuel/oil. Called local USCG and was advised to call the The National Response Center USCG in Wash DC. LONG story short, I’ve now activated the military (USCG) for an oil slick  #lovemyjob

9283 2018-02-04 18:18:24 I like medallions of zucchini & yellow squash sauteed together in olive oil w/ onions & garlic, and a dusting of parmesan at the finish.
9284 2018-02-04 18:18:19 Thanks for just being awesome in general

9287 2018-02-04 18:18:03 Kang Daniel keeps me awake, yes he gives me energy to burn the midnight oil and finish my shitz 
9288 2018-02-04 18:17:52 I sometimes wonder if major oil producers (*cough* Saudi) deliberately overstate reserves so as to depress price and avoid sending price signal that would trigger mass conversion away from oil, leaving their oil in the ground, unsold.
9289 2018-02-04 18:17:49 Well I'm sure glad we have you to depend us from the soulless corporations that would dare to send oil down the pipe, on the rail, or even by truck..they can keep their stinking oil and not ship it anywhere. That way when your ambulances, buses, and fire trucks run out of fuel
9290 2018-02-04 18:17:35 GOOD NOW GET STARTED ON THAT OIL PAINTING OF ME HUNTY 
9291 2018-02-04 18:17:26 Is this oil quality or transportation issue?
9292 2018-02-04 18:17:08 when writing narrative, key details should be embodied in more ways than one

          and meaning
9293 2018-02-04 18:17:04 Yeah it's like olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette or somethin
9294 2018-02-04 18:17:02 Gotta love spending over $200 on your car when you only came for an oil change
9295 2018-02-04 18:17:01 ‘Minor’ in this sense means the guy who compulsively covers the sidewalk in oil. It means the MANY guys who masturbate in public. It means people acting erratically and dangerously. It’s more than just sleeping on the beach.
9296 2018-02-04 18:16:58 .@valentino_jimmy That's were really wants their oil reserves. I signed the pledge- nonsense, they.
9297 2018-02-04 18:16:21 @Biossance the free sample of #squalane + vit c rose oil converted me. I keep touching my face in amazement at how soft my skin is. (Full size bottle in the mail) Smart promo!

9301 2018-02-04 18:16:09 Chavez didn’t have any plan to recover our independent economy from oil. His only plan was to reform the constitution with socialist roots that put in jeopardy private property, the right to bear arms, education and freedom. That was his whole presidential agenda.
9302 2018-02-04 18:16:07 Arguing with a trump supporter is like trying to wash bird shit off your windshield with olive oil.   

Mueller will get him in the end.
9303 2018-02-04 18:15:59 Coconut oil is so amazing  using it on my hair for years has legit made my hair so strong and thick and my skins so goood
9304 2018-02-04 18:15:56 Grape seed oil
9305 2018-02-04 18:15:55 My local 'progressive' government is shilling just as hard for the oil lobby as the reactionary one we had for 38 years & it sucks. All should remember, Alberta is more complicit than most for the destruction global warming will wrought.
9306 2018-02-04 18:15:45 One of the reasons Mayor DeBlasio won reelection by a landslide was because he is committed to fighting Climate Change, it's up to American state and city leaders to fight toxic oil and coal companies. Trump, Zinke and Pruitt are all criminals.
9307 2018-02-04 18:15:38 Cod liver oil is back in fashion, though!
9308 2018-02-04 18:15:36 actually it is scotlands income, Scotland sends the collected taxes from oil to Westminster who then return 70% back to Scotland.

so in short England does not subsidies Scotland but rather the other way around.
9309 2018-02-04 18:15:07 Surely this is Kinder Morgan trying to make 3x the profit and using politics to get it . Oil is not selling !! Refine it in Alberta and sell it to Canadians
9310 2018-02-04 18:15:02 I have this amazing face wash that's all natural with mixtures of jojoboa oil, castor oil etc but it's amazing!

9317 2018-02-04 18:14:27 I think it's oil? For bread? Idk
9318 2018-02-04 18:13:51 What about an oil? A nice lightweight one that’s still moisturizing. Also, straight up aloe Vera. So cheap and literally the best thing I’ve found for daytime that doesn’t break me out.
9319 2018-02-04 18:13:50 Lls oil man be blessing
9320 2018-02-04 18:13:49 Oil...the black lifeblood of our ancestors, burned for our all consuming rapaciousness. Our greed will be our grandchildrens’ grief.

9332 2018-02-04 18:13:07 you do know e last FIVE prime ministers all admitted ON RECORD in parliament and in the lords that Scotland subsidies England.

9386 2018-02-04 18:07:22 Given China's massive debt and leverage, wouldn't it make sense that they will have to settle as many oil imports in yuan as soon as possible? Then if their bubble burst it would be easier to print CNY to gloss over issues.

9403 2018-02-04 18:05:06 To be fair, the reports earlier in the week said they would use motor or gear oil. It’s still really bad for the water run off no matter what, though
9404 2018-02-04 18:04:54 The other night, my husband asked me if I thought it was possible to buy a candle that smells like garlic and onions frying in olive oil. I told him he should try to google it.

9413 2018-02-04 18:04:16 8)... Hydro. When tech is there, we'll switch. Look at Shell's move to green investment. You want to improve the planet as a whole? We need more CAD oil to displace oil from dirtier producing count. that don't care about citizen's rights. Focus on cleaning up GHG in China / India
9414 2018-02-04 18:04:14 Okay motor oil on the poles on Broad Street seems like a risky idea, no?

9416 2018-02-04 18:04:03 Had a discussion about renewables v. nuclear with a friend; he was lamenting subsidies for wind, etc. and claim there were none comparable for nuclear. Brought up Price Anderson Act. What's that, he asked? Oil and gas receive huge subsidies from the US government as well.
9417 2018-02-04 18:03:53 My sources say there is a ton of money lined up to put into tight oil. It seems that there is always a line of newbies who think that they're geniuses and can get rich. Peak oil concerns are valid after all.
9418 2018-02-04 18:03:43 What Munish used to say is making sense now. That America only smiles to you when you have seen diamond or oil. Bad that Tanzania thought he was mad

9438 2018-02-04 18:02:02 Here’s a few ways I’ve found to grow. I’d be interested in hearing yours.
Intentionally expose yourself to new art, new events, new instructors, new approaches, new IDEAS. If you’re an oil painter, try watercolor or acrylics. If you’re a watercolorist, try gouache, or pastel. 2/6
9439 2018-02-04 18:02:02 yeah my mum is the root of my essential oil usage tbh 
9440 2018-02-04 18:01:48 Underneath one roof in Kensington met today artists/painters from all over the world - the beautiful art and depiction of issues of the times we live in. Great liberating experience after a long time and to hear them talk through their paintings and the feast of colour on oil.

9443 2018-02-04 18:00:57 So am I right @DiabetesUK that two ingredients of my earlier life might be acceptable in diet. Cod liver oil and malt; and dandelion and burdock?

9446 2018-02-04 18:00:35 Don't take racing tips from Sir Ian he's nae good.

2035/2040? BIG underestimation there from the man in the industry. You'd think with building his fortune around Oil & Gas he'd have known what's really going on. Almost like he was politicking with that statement 
9447 2018-02-04 18:00:34 Barrel of Oil: Barel adalah standar ukuran volume minyak mentah dalam perdagangan minyak internasional.
9448 2018-02-04 18:00:22 they taste the same. And oil is less than a frying pan
9449 2018-02-04 18:00:18 I worked in a speed shop at a teen. Gear oil is the worst. If they want to take it to a new level, used gear oil is ten times worse. Stinks. Stains. Never comes out. Takes weeks to get the smell off your skin.

9453 2018-02-04 17:59:25 If Venezuela had capitalism, people wouldn't be eating zoo animals to survive. Look at what the state controls. Oil, farming, manufacturing, schools, and health services. The state provides for the citizens, sounds like socialism, looks like socialism, must be socialism
9454 2018-02-04 17:59:23 Gotta soak my hands in some warm water and baby oil or something,  winter been rough on 'em.

9457 2018-02-04 17:59:05 Crisco is flammable, hydraulic fluids are often mineral oil- or water-based and aren’t flammable. Philly had its chance 2 weeks ago to light the poles on fire and blew it.

9469 2018-02-04 17:58:05 For that perfect "gas station drip" anytime, pour stale loose grind into used motor oil and heat gently. 
9470 2018-02-04 17:58:04 While I agree that understanding is required to distribute the value of data. It in itself is an asset class. How we mine, store, and distribute from a crude to usable product is an industry just as oil or goal or agri would be.

9472 2018-02-04 17:57:48 White male oligarchs who have dominated World power via industry, oil, and gas for the last 150 years can sense their own extinction. This alone explains the current collusive nature between Russia, GOP, and the Trump administration.

This responsible industry pays for Canadians to have healthcare, schools, etc. Which are available to everyone...
9480 2018-02-04 17:56:43 You can most likely find a "peer reviewed" journal article both for AND against any exercise or nutrition issue depending on the agenda of the group funding the study. We all react differently to stimulus. One study doesn't mean fish oil will kill you.
9481 2018-02-04 17:56:39 Not motor oil. The bucket literally says hydraulic fluid on it.

9486 2018-02-04 17:56:15 The Premier has to defend what is left of the oil economy. Her people expect her to do that. That's the politics. Here in BC we like to think a pristine environment is worth defending and taking on more risk is not worth it.

9492 2018-02-04 17:55:40 I love a good olive oil. Some are so delicious I just want to stick a straw in them. My dad ported at Rota several times, when I was a child, but I never went.

9501 2018-02-04 17:53:48 It isn't that.  It's because by defunding the ACA, not even the first responders will have comprehesive health care, if any at all.  And re chemical and oil spills?  Those cleanup regs are gone.

9514 2018-02-04 17:52:35 I paid $50 lol for the upgraded oil
9515 2018-02-04 17:52:32 There is almost nothing that can't be made better with garlic and olive oil. And maybe some butter as well.

9519 2018-02-04 17:51:58 Great !! Glad you liked it , thanks
9520 2018-02-04 17:51:53 So proud of myself for getting my ass up in this shitty weather to get my oil change
9521 2018-02-04 17:51:52 I won’t say who I want. Either way, I want to see a riot out of Philly. Oil tanking would be great too
9522 2018-02-04 17:51:43 Kate, what is the origin of the oil used for your Goretex jacket, your car, shipping your avacados from USA?  Let me help you. Lots from dictator regimes that throw  off buildings.  Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil.  You choose @vancouverpride
9523 2018-02-04 17:51:35 Almond oil for the win?
9524 2018-02-04 17:51:29 4) so, you're wrong. It isn't some of the most environmentally damaging. We're also building oil infrastructure because YOU demand it. Don't want oil pipelines? Stop using computers with microprocessors, plastic water bottles for drinking, nylon in your clothes, shingles and...
9525 2018-02-04 17:51:29 Is there anything that coconut oil cannot do?
9526 2018-02-04 17:51:18 Not oil, water
9527 2018-02-04 17:51:09 thanks. I said thanks instead of "Liking.":)
9528 2018-02-04 17:50:56 Coconut oil stinks 
9529 2018-02-04 17:50:54 Coconut oil is literally the tears of Jesus Christ
9530 2018-02-04 17:50:45 I have to do them in my oven, but a little olive oil spritzed on and get that nice little browning....yummo!
9531 2018-02-04 17:50:42 I live in a Senior Place--My neighbor is from Alaska BC she is a Land owner and Taxpayer? She gets a check like ALL ALSAKANS get a check from the OIL  and the pipeline --I feel this is a GREAT IDEA personally.
9532 2018-02-04 17:50:41 Cabo Verde Islands off Africa had a lot of solar and wind, but still relied on oil for 70% of their electricity. 
A 100MWh battery was installed, and now only 30% of electricity needs to be produced with oil.

9535 2018-02-04 17:50:28 I think most used whale oil but some had access to kerosene, and since methods of using fossil fuels were developed in the mid 1800s she tries to draw a parallel between two unrelated things.

9537 2018-02-04 17:50:22 Agree but I was dead wrong in late 2015-early 2016 when I thought the capital enablers would walk away from tight oil. Instead, they saw opportunity to buy low & probably made a lot of money on share price casino gambling. What's maybe different now is more asset class options.

9546 2018-02-04 17:49:31 Probably because they gave a new kind of snake oil to cure the problem that's not really there...
9547 2018-02-04 17:49:26 Salted butter is fine. I made up some recipes with oil when I wanted cake and didn't have ingredients
9548 2018-02-04 17:49:24 Putting the oil companies out of business is neither far left Communism, nor far right Capitalism. It is a new paradigm, say Realism.
9549 2018-02-04 17:49:24 damn, that sounds good... wonder what would happen using olive oil instead of butter?
9550 2018-02-04 17:49:22 Tillerson says US continues to consider oil sanctions on VZ -- thinking abt if they would bring a more rapid end to the suffering of the VZ people, in press conference in Buenos Aires
9551 2018-02-04 17:49:17 It is a shrewd political move towards keeping their NDP governments in power. Horgan gets to keep his popular election promise and needed support of the Greens. Notley gets show Albertans and  Jason  Kenny how tough she can be in defending Alberta's oil industry.
9552 2018-02-04 17:49:17 It’s not hippies vs rig pigs. Why should BC take on all the risk? Our eco-tourism industry is worth more than oil. Lefties are right by accident. Economically the pipe is bad for BC. Spills happen all the time and we have no effective clean-up strategy.
9553 2018-02-04 17:49:13 I smell like mad tea tree oil, I know this cab driver stressed
9554 2018-02-04 17:49:02 Big Businesses that have benefitted from Lobbyists? Should in all fairtness cough up some cash also. Big Oil? Is taking oil in American soil. The oil should belong to all Americans not just EXXON or SHELL OR GULF OIL Companies. IMO

9560 2018-02-04 17:48:22 Although the Middle East has many conflicts with the outside world, we cannot forget its advantages to the world as well. Consisting of the world's largest oil producer and exporter in the world, the Middle East does in fact matter.
9561 2018-02-04 17:48:16 Especially the billions and billions of dollars the alt-right Koch Brothers and their ilk from the US have poured into the Alberta gas and oil industry (and the Fraser Institute). I agree this should be widely publicised.

9563 2018-02-04 17:47:59 I bought a steel toe work boot oil resistant and the soal is coming apart already. I paid about 200 for them.
9564 2018-02-04 17:47:57 Coconut oil is acc a life saver
9565 2018-02-04 17:47:52 I haven't! I usually opt for guac or sliced avocado in lieu of oil or dressing. #GuacWorld #GNO
9566 2018-02-04 17:47:43 better decrease the prixe of oil, reduce the taxes, your initiative is useless
9567 2018-02-04 17:47:39 @SecretaryPerry   Why is our government so ok with falling behind China. Other countries are ahead of us as far as clean energy. China will be the new world power while we continue with oil & gas for the rich owners. We don’t even take care of our Infrastructure

9579 2018-02-04 17:46:29 No I support environmentally responsible energy options and I think AB should stop relying on oil to support their entire economy. Invest in new technology, renewable energy, and research.
9580 2018-02-04 17:46:29 What frustrates me is you buy sanders extractors so you can get a better finish, if you were painting over with oil you know it’s going to be worth the time & investment, going over with w/b with a brush can end up looking worse than when you started & spray machines ain’t cheap
9581 2018-02-04 17:46:21 Probably change the oil on that bitch or some just on the strength
9582 2018-02-04 17:46:05 Seems to me delivery isn’t a bad idea. It could increase Ride growth - BUT the rates and pay need to come up. We have rising oil prices, inflation on the horizon, etc.  but I’d rather deliver a package than a belligerent drunk.  #uber

Canada is responsible for 2% of world GHG, oil sands are around 8% of Canada's total meaning .0016%...

9605 2018-02-04 17:42:41 Had a freakish breakfast accident, perhaps due to trying to start with the frozen onions in the pan instead of the potatoes. Contents of the pan erupted in smoke. Usual amount of oil, normal heat level.

9613 2018-02-04 17:41:47 Key takeaway from #NunesMemo is that the FBI had probable cause that Carter Page was an agent of a foreign power, aka as Russia. Let's also recall that Page's relationship to Russia is entirely about just one thing: #oil.
9614 2018-02-04 17:41:41 Nobody in your bubble world you mean. By 2050 we will be out of oil. The world has already consumed HALF of the worlds oil.

9656 2018-02-04 17:36:12 Jumin scent marks this one part of the kitchen a shit ton and that's apparently been building up layers of oil and fur that today started to look like mold and gave me the biggest scare of my life
9657 2018-02-04 17:36:10 I wonder how many of these oil wells in New Mexico are on Indian burial grounds.

9659 2018-02-04 17:35:43 Having quantified this, typing in population, wages and rents is easy and you see that they just correlate in a fairly strict ratio.

You also have to adjust for "nice scenery" and "nice weather" or local factors like oil in Aberdeen.
9660 2018-02-04 17:35:41 You are officially my favorite Twitter persona today!! Re the essential oil mommy groups, NO you can NOT treat serious skin and soft tissue infections with thyme oil; and peppermint oil does not treat asthma.
9661 2018-02-04 17:35:26 Yes check out @PharmaXtracts they have top notch cbd oil. Just recently brought hemp flower to the scene and they can ship it everywhere. They should be accepting #Verge as a payment method, hopefully soon. They already accept from coinbase. I highly recommend their products
9662 2018-02-04 17:35:23 The TB12 method needs him to play a few more years so more people buy into the snake oil science.
9663 2018-02-04 17:35:12 I sort of want to give it a try too, though some ingredients are hard to come by here (sake, those mushrooms) or just don't want to use it(probably will replace butter with olive oil and I don't want to use consomé)
9664 2018-02-04 17:35:11 Integrity and politics is oil and water. Cast not a stone unless you too are perfect. Be mad if she doe t tax payer dollars in appropriately but not because she cheated on her spouse that’s between them and not you.
9665 2018-02-04 17:35:06 I don't even put coconut oil on my scalp much less my face. If a shampoo has coconut oil, I'm not buying it

9668 2018-02-04 17:34:40 Way to start my morning as I was going to pickup gas n oil mix for snowblower #BigR.

9671 2018-02-04 17:34:32 How do you think the Red Wing players feel about Blashill ejection? Probably felt that their coach has their back. You wonder why this talented Oilers team half the time plays with no inspiration? Because their coach is uninspiring.
9672 2018-02-04 17:34:22 Er, no. Motor oil has a relatively high flash point. Motor oil isn’t that easy to light on fire.

9676 2018-02-04 17:34:03 ha! @DevinNunes didn’t write the dud memo nor did he even read all the information prior to having his aide write the dud. of course it proved opposite of the snake oil nunes was trying to sell
9677 2018-02-04 17:34:02 If in the future a religion split is necessary, the Shia are geographically best placed to take advantage. The region has dominat oil fields, coastlines, the Shatt al-Arab waterway, ports, outside world access, and even more!

9680 2018-02-04 17:33:56 Then why put toxic flammable motor oil on them?
9681 2018-02-04 17:33:50 Of course we have relied far too long The biggest shocker is the Saudi's are leading the charge They are making way more money of of renewable Energy now and are switching gears on a planetary level where investment is concerned they literally cut out 75% of their oil princes
9682 2018-02-04 17:33:49 Peppermint oil is a life saver for my migraines. It doesn’t get rid of it, but takes away a bit of the edge. I put it on my temples and back of my neck!
9683 2018-02-04 17:33:32 So glad my dads girlfriends truck is fixed, even though I've needed a simple oil change for the last month.

9688 2018-02-04 17:32:50 Why would he stop? He got kudos for the impotent act of filing suit against the oil and gas industry. Logically, one would save the effort and implement strategies to wean NYC off fossils (pun intended). But since he got re-elected he takes it as an endorsement of his policies

9691 2018-02-04 17:32:31 Went to an art exhibition last night. Accidentally brushed against a painting on the wall and ended up smearing oil paints all over my best jacket. What kind of fucking art isn't dry before it's displayed?!?

9695 2018-02-04 17:32:12 Let’s get back in point, Russia’s biggest export is energy.  Trump opening coal, natural gas and oil is a direct threat to Russian energy exports.  Your logic somehow points to Putin supporting that by “interfering for Trump” in our election.  Please explain why that would be.

9738 2018-02-04 17:26:35 If you weren't intending that, then people wouldn't mention it. They would simply say "before your investment". The term arab and oil is used because people seem to think there is something wrong with that...which I cant see.
9739 2018-02-04 17:26:33 So he was a neocon or a rino then? That's what they are today. Both parties work for their donors, and yes democrats have big donors. Warren buffet and obama come to mind. He sold his railroad shares when obama could no longer block oil pipeline, he made bank off that deal w/oil

9749 2018-02-04 17:25:17 Nope a spray bottle. I diluted the apple cider by adding water and then added Jamaican castor oil separately to my scalp afterwards and a little bit of tea tree oil.

I think minimizing + only using gentle products is what I needed!!!
9753 2018-02-04 17:25:08 The need to mention it is an irrelevance. You are mentioning it as though there's something negative about our owner being arabic and a lot of his money coming from the oil industry.

9764 2018-02-04 17:23:55 That Indomie advert though. You see packs of Minimie chinchin, Dano milk, Power Oil etc conspicuously displayed at the scene where the kids visited the Mallam's shop. Isn't this free advert for those brands?
9765 2018-02-04 17:23:54 So a guy who makes weird, disjointed movies that display his Daddy issues doesn't make good choices about stunts? Who would have thought. I'll go tell the guys working in the North Dakota Oil fields not for millions of dollars to weep for her.
9766 2018-02-04 17:23:51 No clue!  You and I and most citizens of this country don't want to!  Our government wants superiority and cash!  (oil, whatever goods they can steal from these people)!

Actually, motor oil can withstand incredibly high temps before igniting.  The bulk of a typical motor oil consists of hydrocarbonswith between 18 and 34 carbon atoms per molecule.

9780 2018-02-04 17:22:21 In 2070 the world's known oil and gas reserves will likely be forecast out to 2130 due to continual new discovery and improved extraction technologies. Nuclear still a better bet than hydrocarbons, mind, but I don't buy peak anything.

9794 2018-02-04 17:20:13 For example, China is currently the world's largest importer of oil. And it also heavily relies on coal as an energy source. A significant amount of this comes directly from African countries such as Nigeria, Chad, Uganda, Cameroon, and Ghana.

9796 2018-02-04 17:20:01 Diffusing tea tree oil is a power move
9797 2018-02-04 17:19:57 We get cheaper oil, cars, and other goods for that money that we'd get otherwise, you know.

9801 2018-02-04 17:19:39 I think Dr @mercola needs to take over at the AHA!!! My LDL went down when I switched from margarine and vegetable oil to butter and coconut oil!

9803 2018-02-04 17:19:35 It may have been appropriate for the times but moving forward an all of the above climate strategy is necessary. All of the above climate strategy is ideal as it maximizes optionality and reductions but can't enable indefinite oil production
9804 2018-02-04 17:19:32 Loving Vincent, WOW! Every single frame is an oil painting, how did they pull that off?  It's beautiful!
9805 2018-02-04 17:19:30 That stuff is biodegradable hydraulic fluid, not motor oil. Vegetable based, very mildly flammable but harmless beyond that. The children of Philadelphia will survive, you can all rest easy
9806 2018-02-04 17:19:29 A use coconut smelling tan, coconut shampoo / conditioner, coconut candles n coconut oil to moisturise, am actual just a big coconut
9807 2018-02-04 17:19:25 Thanks. Sorry Chapter 1 isn’t finished yet, it needs a few layers and drying time between as it’s in oil :)
9808 2018-02-04 17:19:20 UN has so many Muslim/islamic  country as its members.... oil rich country... and they are supplying huge amount of money to these European nation.... in return... they are asking them to accept these devil refugee.... these heads of country like Angla Markel, pm of UK, Sweden...

9831 2018-02-04 17:18:50 Probably a good reason why we should ship crude oil by rail instead of building a pipeline.
9832 2018-02-04 17:18:43 Seasoned with salt and pepper. Olive oil in the pan.  High heat, seared each side about 2-3 minutes. Bast in garlic and butter. Let rest for 10-15 minutes.
9833 2018-02-04 17:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
9834 2018-02-04 17:18:31 “This is oil from the gland of an otter”
9835 2018-02-04 17:17:46 The countries moving away from coal are like US which has access to cheaper oil and more importantly GAS. They are moving to gas. Europe is removing coal by going to expensive renewables for clean energy development. China has abundant solar manufacturing capacity.
9836 2018-02-04 17:17:20 Apparently, adding a spoonful of coconut oil to your diet at least twice a day can promote weight loss. Like not just cooking with it, actually ingesting it.
9837 2018-02-04 17:17:05 Roasted potatoes with garlic and onion, or any veggies. Use olive oil not butter
9838 2018-02-04 17:17:01 Trump himself, allegedly was offered up to a 19 percent stake in Rosneft, Russia’s  oil company, in return for his lifting the sanctions imposed on Russia by Pres. Obama. Subsequently, stocks of Rosneft were transfer to a partnership  owned by a shadowy Corp in the Cayman Islands

Can we keep our oil too Master?
9841 2018-02-04 17:16:43 Oil and water- the two most monetized and hoarded liquids on the planet.
9842 2018-02-04 17:15:46 I wonder what it would be like if the world was an oil canvas, and I was the only one who could effect it.
9843 2018-02-04 17:15:43 That is not true. In Guatemala the US gov wanted regime change because they didn't like who was running the country.  With Iraq Bush lied about WMD to steal that country's oil wealth. In Vietnam the US propped up a violent anti democratic regime

9847 2018-02-04 17:15:20 Just your Super Bowl Sunday PSA:

If you bought a new deep frier and a bunch of frozen delights to tempt your guests with during the big game, maybe just bake that stuff in the oven instead, ok?

Hot oil, frozen foods, drunken guests and a rookie fry cook is a recipe for disaster
9848 2018-02-04 17:15:18 Exactly.
Plus russian budget is based on oil, gas, coal- energy independent and heavily producing America is a curse for russia.
Plus America with strong army and protecting its interests is a curse for Putin.

9852 2018-02-04 17:14:37 Some are in water, some in olive oil. Omega 6 concern?
9853 2018-02-04 17:14:34 Sounds like you need to try all 3!  I love smoked wings, and the air fryer can give a nice crispy finish if you want. Especially with a little oil sprayed on...
9854 2018-02-04 17:14:23 It means a growth in demand for clean energy. If you electrify heating replacing coal, your demand for clean energy grows. Same goes for synthetic fuels that are carbon neutral and replace oil for transport.
9855 2018-02-04 17:14:17 Climate change doesn’t recognize borders. Reducing emissions in the middle of the jungle benefits us as much as them. AND gives them greener power without building coal or oil fired infrastructure.
9856 2018-02-04 17:14:11 Yes! Kentucky Wired project is already funded. Tax revenue from legalizing hemp cultivation. I mean industrial hemp: paper, clothing, rope, oil, a renewable resource—and during WW2 Ky led the US in production. Legalizing medical use of marijuana would also benefit.

9884 2018-02-04 17:10:55 Democrats are into big pharma. Republicans are into big oil.

If you like it sweet add stevia to taste.

9913 2018-02-04 17:07:55 I heard the mission was a success. Glad we had those two teams of oil rig peeps to drill into the asteroid and drop a nuke in it to split it up so it won’t hit us! Whew!
9914 2018-02-04 17:07:54 This is about money. Mostly oil money. Putin is tied in to Russian oil companies, and sanctions are preventing them from making billions of $ that they would otherwise make.
9915 2018-02-04 17:07:52 Well, if you remember, part of the Russian oil co. has kind of disappeared. It isn’t clear where all the money went. I think that that’s part of the pymt for dropping sanctions. The 1% are helping each other worldwide so they can be kings/emperors once again.
9916 2018-02-04 17:07:52 Kate, You are ok with Blood Diamonds?   more enviro friendly mines should shut &  should buy Blood Diamonds mined by slaves? You prefer the world buys dictator oil and seem ok that  t thrown off buildings.

9948 2018-02-04 17:04:51 There are some blogs out there but all of them appear to have some snake oil cure attached.

In this field if a medical study is more than a year old it's outdated information.

We need a site with the most up-to-date study findings we can have as well as diet/Vit B, methylfolate

9961 2018-02-04 17:03:16 You don't pray. Or think, for that matter.

As if "thoughts and prayers" weren't empty enough, these come from an atheist and a moron.

What else do you have to offer the victims? Good wishes? Snake oil?

9965 2018-02-04 17:02:53 Gus O’Donnell has said “this backlash against evidence is because [Brexiters] know where the experts will go...if you’re selling snake oil, you don’t like experts testing your products”. The sound of a nail being hit on the head.

9980 2018-02-04 17:01:08 Neither are we. We told the americans that we found oil and that they could come and drill it for us

Then we changed the laws to they would have to give us the blueprint to their oil platforms and started drilling ourselves
9981 2018-02-04 17:01:07 Those calling for another change must include the return of our oil blocks to the people and their illegitimately collected public funds since 1960 by all persons to be returned.

9992 2018-02-04 17:00:45 My son was never interested in working on cars...but you couldn't keep her away when daddy worked on one. To this day, she still changes her own oil, brakes and other basic maintenance.
9993 2018-02-04 17:00:45 Nutella contains palm oil, which is terrible for both trees and the animals trying to live in them!
9994 2018-02-04 17:00:36 I find if you add a little cinnamon to the oil you get a pleasant scent along with the obvious functionality of a solid rubber band
9995 2018-02-04 17:00:36 ไม่ได้สะกิดเลยยยยย จริ้งๆ 
9996 2018-02-04 17:00:29 My Uber driver last night offered me free oil

10002 2018-02-04 16:59:48 I'm a firm believer in #FollowTheMoney Unfortunately cancer is a booming industry in the medical field. Billions of money would be lost with a cure. Personally I've begun taking high dose CBD oil as a preventative. It has been shown to shrink tumor cells.
10003 2018-02-04 16:59:32 Oil show here we come!
10004 2018-02-04 16:59:30 Should have never eliminated the Stelly Plan. Could have enacted a statute that suspended it when adequate money was coming in from oil revenue and other. Impose it when income was scarce. Cutting the spending doesn’t seem to be relevant when we want to gift the wealthy.
10005 2018-02-04 16:59:10 Anyone know how to make cooking oil?
10006 2018-02-04 16:59:03 Tulog nako oy, ma stress rakog samot makakita kilay nga lamion.

10008 2018-02-04 16:59:01 Secondly, how does getting rid of regulations designed to stop banks from risking economic collapse help? Getting rid of the EPA by filling it with climate change denying oil company bosses? 
He's not given up his family business, he's profiting from using his own properties.
10009 2018-02-04 16:58:59 I am not at all a fan of JT but he is correct swing the  Economy, Environment and prosperity for all Canadians are all interconnected, we need them all to succeed.  This oil to market will start to lower China's coal use, overall more important in the big picture.
10010 2018-02-04 16:58:59 How would we have uninterrupted power supply when most of our leaders are oil investors.We spend trillions every year importing refined oil & selling to ourselves.Nigeria is the largest market in Africa.American,China,SA are milking us,but we Nigerians are also milking ourselves

10015 2018-02-04 16:58:22 Oh, how I would introduce them to the oil pan of my car! (Lord forgive me)
10016 2018-02-04 16:58:14 Even the 1k bonuses (the Pelosi who called crumbs) and now being criticized as "out of touch". It is crumbs compared to their profit windfall.  I just sent 1k on a month worth of home heating oil. I know of no one getting raises or bonuses.
10017 2018-02-04 16:58:06 question: how much money does  or did trump have invested in bp oil?, someone was pushing production.
10018 2018-02-04 16:57:59 He’s a run pass qb which gundy has spoke about going back to. Think Zac robinsonish..OIL BARON is more Rudolph type. I’d even give kolar a shot since that is the style of player he was in HS. Wudetee is just a guy,probably will end switching to wideout or a special package player
10019 2018-02-04 16:57:50 I’m about climbing the walls with pain. Don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve tried everything apart from clove oil but I’m scared to put anything in my mouth. Will have to see the dentist first thing tomorrow again

10021 2018-02-04 16:57:15 Love! If the soda companies buy the land to plant slow growing and low oxygen producing palms for oil? Why can't we come together and stop buying soda and lets use the money to buy the land for the wildlife/plants,and our homeless people to live. Why give the money to soda?
10022 2018-02-04 16:57:12 Castor oil didn’t work for you ?
