36 2018-02-17 20:34:30 I grew up in a family that received commodities for being poor.  Powdered milk, a big block of “cheese” product, economy sized canned foods. They’re gross, hard to eat. I still can’t eat ‘American’ cheese. Don’t do this to families in need. #FoodStamps
37 2018-02-17 20:29:47 Don’t you recognise the contradiction?  You focus on their lives but remove the fact that it’s all in preparation to kill them when most profitable to do so.  They’re commodities, “livestock”,  whose lives are valued in terms of products, not their intrinsic worth. #februdairy
38 2018-02-17 20:29:03 When I was a child I had 7 siblings and food stamps didn't exist. When my dad was laid off he would go to the welfare office and work to receive food vouchers for a local grocer, later on they added commodities.

@realDonaldTrump's plan is a great way to curb welfare fraud.

42 2018-02-17 20:17:00 but by that reading, the 1970s commodities boom allowed the communist bloc to paper over the growth slowdown; delayed the crises of the 1980s
43 2018-02-17 20:14:25 there’s already 5000 out there and many of them treat creators as commodities not artists or humans
44 2018-02-17 20:13:10 I support boycotting China as it is an inhumane country that treats its people like commodities. We shouldn't be fueling China's economy in any way whatsoever, it's hypocritical at best, treasonous at worst.
45 2018-02-17 20:12:18 When it comes to necessities of life, I’m in agreement. This isn’t a stock or bond market. Homes are necessities, not commodities to be bought and sold for profit.
46 2018-02-17 20:11:35 Lets see what next weeks closing stock prices are; as the world falls so does the population rise in Illinois, the great western flow of peoples; mysterious earth moves people colorful people commodities markets by state.
47 2018-02-17 20:07:57 took this is one of those times that white people slip & show the truth...that people of color, especially black people, are just commodities to them & we shouldn’t have a voice...it’s time POC boycott American racism & close off access to our contributions
48 2018-02-17 20:03:47 Como el kirchnerismo, funcionaba cuando tenías las commodities por las nubes. El problema es tener miedo a ajustar cuando no tenés los recursos de antes.
49 2018-02-17 20:01:14 Somehow, as "consumers" of this sewage, we must train ourselves to look elsewhere. That proves difficult when so many commodities are controlled by others.
50 2018-02-17 19:45:25 Sometimes I hear from someone that’s “trying” to build trust with me say “do you trust me?” Look, I get it, but to build trust you have to demonstrate that you are worthy of
trust. The two rarest commodities are trust and loyalty, so build and approach them wisely.
51 2018-02-17 19:42:33 I’m thinking we traded a large organization to obtain, store, inventory and distribute commodities as a cost saving measure.
52 2018-02-17 19:27:05 As a kid, never wanted to be a astronaut, football player or fireman etc. I just wanted to trade commodities, like Winthrop and Valetine in Trading Places.
53 2018-02-17 19:16:25 China is one of the most inhumane countries on the planet that treats its people like commodities. The last thing Western Countries should be doing is supporting China with business.
54 2018-02-17 19:12:06 and “discord,” and “distrust” of our government and corporate elites, who love us as they love their own children, and who would never try to manipulate us, or treat us like interchangeable commodities, or bankrupt us with their Ponzi schemes,
55 2018-02-17 19:07:11 I am totally against the idea of private individuals offering a bounty to apprehend the #Guptas. Law enforcement agencies must do their job to find them or any other alleged criminal. Human beings should never be auctioned like commodities or animal
56 2018-02-17 19:02:43 Don't hire me because I am #Autistic hire me because you see my value as an individual. This kind of goes for anyone deemed a "minority". We're valuable, not as commodities.
57 2018-02-17 19:00:07 There is nothing bold, new or healthy about commodities. I waited many long days in line in the 70’s for canned meat, peanut, butter, green beans, a block of cheese, powdered eggs and dried mashed potatoes. And these were used in addition to food stamps not in place of them.
58 2018-02-17 18:54:03 But you paid her, thus the women and the babies are commodities! If you are being honest, you chose Ukraine over the UK because of the commodity factor, in UK the mother could choose to not to hand over the baby, the Ukraine mother didn't have that choice.
59 2018-02-17 18:52:01 Well we can boost his chances of being the next financier... buy his book & maybe invest in brown fat research which feels like commodities! #DayTrading #investors who wants to be a #millionaire ?

61 2018-02-17 18:50:59 Food boxes are okay to me, commodities worked for my family when I was young. At least I didn’t see any abuse of the system like we see now with ENT cards and food stamps.

63 2018-02-17 18:48:36 Market cap for #cryptocurrencies is strange to me.  Why don’t we call it #cryptocurrency #moneysupply #M1 or #M2 (#HODL ers savings) and express it against a basket of #currencies.  Treat it like #FX.  Don’t treat it or tax it like #stocks or #commodities.  #crypto
64 2018-02-17 18:24:01 Price of anything doesnt go down once it goes up in that country because the people are already accustomed to their gains in greed. If the price of petrol goes to N50. The prices of most commodities will still remain the same.  Subsidies of fuel by Govt is a good step but our ..
65 2018-02-17 17:57:43 “treating women as mere breeding machines and babies as commodities." No. You’re thinking of conservatives.

67 2018-02-17 17:45:07 I'm saying that tariffs are not as significant a barrier in the developed world as previously because we don't sell as much raw commodities for which price is only factor. As to regulatory compliance, obviously our exporters will need to comply with EU requirements to export to
68 2018-02-17 17:40:04 In this type of competitive environment, I wonder what impact restricting trade of agriculture commodities will have?   It looks like there are other options for China to purchase ag commodities.

72 2018-02-17 17:31:01 This is like the old commodities program. Poor foods, not enough, and their will always be people at the top that profit and elderly, single parent homes, and disabled that will lose.
73 2018-02-17 17:28:30 Creo q seria como q al valer menos el dolar se necesitan mas dolares para comprar la misma cantidad de commodities y por eso suben sus precios. Los republicanos gralmte. depresian el dolar por lo q se espera suba de oil (al menos x ese lado)
74 2018-02-17 17:23:22 I don't see them as commodities, I see them as the same sentient beings as you. Even more, because I have a close relationship with them. I know their names & everything about them. It's gut-wrenching when something happens to them. I love them & give them the best life possible.
75 2018-02-17 17:18:07 I look at bond market. Flight out of bonds = parking the capital in equity and commodities.

80 2018-02-17 17:02:32 As @vernonad says, “Commodities benefit the folks who make them. Food stamps benefit large food companies and their shareholders. Do NOT think this will be about nutrition. People abusing the system will NEVER outweigh the system abusing the people!” #harvestbox @tomcolicchio
81 2018-02-17 17:02:09 Alright, quiz time!
Which is the best-performing commodity so far this year?*
(*Among the members of the Bloomberg Commodities Index)
82 2018-02-17 17:01:00 Si aumentan seriamente los precios de los commodities puede ser. Pero si no, me parece que el balance es negativo: pero bueno, es una sensación, no tengo expertise en ninguno de los items.
83 2018-02-17 17:00:43 The policy you should clamor for is to tell the senator representing you to sponsor a bill to make laws on price control of commodities and the Federal, States, Local governments to subsidize food stuffs for her citizens. Instead of saying policies without mentioning one policy.
84 2018-02-17 16:57:14 This #harvestbox idea of trump & his people regarding those Americans who receive #snap benefits is putting those Americans on commodities. 
I remember commods when I was a kid in the 50's & 60's.
They are taking us backwards in time.
#maga? 
Think again...
85 2018-02-17 16:51:30 we already have this program! it's called "commodities", & specific groups qualify for specific programs
86 2018-02-17 16:49:42 we already have this program! it's called "commodities"

it began many years ago, but got attention in the 80's with the "free cheese" program that distributed millions of pounds of cheese that was sitting in warehouses

i can qualify, and sometimes, go get a box
87 2018-02-17 16:49:25 Faz-se necessário auditar a dívida pública, taxar rendimentos das instituições financeiras, rever a desoneração de exportação de commodities, identificar e cobrar os devedores da Previdência isso é melhor do que a dita reforma da previdência
88 2018-02-17 16:46:24 @amjoyshow why doesn't anybody know we already have this program? it's called "commodities"!
89 2018-02-17 16:44:58 @JoyAnnReid 
i don't understand why nobody brings up the fact that we already have this program--it's called "commodities", & is available to certain groups
90 2018-02-17 16:44:09 Lu semua pikir klub bola gede2 itu nganggep elu yg sampe bela2in ina inu demi so called kebanggaan? 

No, you are commodities. 
Elu pada cuma jadi konsumen.

Kacian deh lu~
91 2018-02-17 16:42:34 Trump's brilliant new Food Program, is essentially the old Food Commodities program. It was dropped because it was a poor program. This entire administration is doomed to repeat history in the worst way.
92 2018-02-17 16:42:27 It's clear that victimhood has become one of the cherished commodities in our society, and acquiring the label is a pathway to empowerment.  Worse, children are being taught to seek out its seductive nectar.
93 2018-02-17 16:20:37 All I can think of is when I was a little girl, used to stand in line w baskets w my mom & get cans of processed meat corn green beans flour rice sometimes peanut butter sometimes real butter powdered milk. We would stand 4 hours in long lines . I learned to cook w commodities.
94 2018-02-17 16:17:09 sir all political or war noise will not hurt market................  stock market and commodities  is in strong uptrend for atleast 10 years
95 2018-02-17 16:17:04 These food items you mentioned are you aware these farmers need to transport them from the rural areas to the city? 
I think for the next decade the  $$ rate will always determine price of commodities in Africa as we keep having analog leaders in Africa. We need digital leaders.
96 2018-02-17 16:14:13 And the ultimate price you pay, is one that no amount of hard work can ever repay, the most precious of all commodities........that price is time!
97 2018-02-17 16:03:41 hey @NPRNewsNow if you only have five minutes to recap the current top stories, how on Earth was the change in the price of oil on NY commodities markets important enough to include yesterday?
98 2018-02-17 15:44:47 Tell you something girls with low snapchat scores are rare commodities
99 2018-02-17 15:36:31 Guns were once considered necessary tools in this country. Now they’re fetishized commodities treated with near religious reverence by their fans. But they effect everyone.
100 2018-02-17 15:28:34 It's also a method of degrading & objectifying women as commodities rather than autonomous persons
101 2018-02-17 15:22:48 Travelling from Calais? The diversion to our Pre check-in waiting Area is now in place for your safety and comfort with commodities and staff to hand.  Please proceed on time for your booked departure. Once check-in and Controls cleared, our service is running well. Merci ^SL
102 2018-02-17 15:22:16 but imagine: would those injections have mattered as much if the New World *only* resulted in more bullion? I think you would have still had marginally more European-Asian trade. BUT the key effect of the New World was bullion AND brand new *commodities*.
103 2018-02-17 15:18:31 Why are people worried? PNB Don’t worry. You will be recapitalised in the next budget, if necessary by increasing GST on some essential commodities. Its the common man’s problem, not the Bank’s#BigBankScam
104 2018-02-17 15:13:29 If #IRR were run as poorly as #PREM then yeah. But I somehow don't imagine Vince is about to suggest that our various commodities should be removed from the main listing and listed as a separate entity!
105 2018-02-17 15:04:45 Good economy, infact the best in Africa before he left.... Stable price of household commodities. Fuel was #89 now it's over #150. A leader that cared for the welfare of it's people.
106 2018-02-17 15:01:28 Rare commodities are worth more than good
107 2018-02-17 14:40:16 We are punishing ourselves by increasing the price of our groceries at the detriment of ourselves like they were purchased in dollars. Those are human effects to themselves not the government fixing the prices of commodities. Bro I am #woke not emotional foolish
108 2018-02-17 14:24:21 We're all confused Boss. I'm on this planet a long time. I won't be manipulated by ensconcing myself in echo chambers. I believe in critical thinking, empirical data and meaningful compromise. These have unfortunately become rare commodities. #useyourheadformorethanahatrack
109 2018-02-17 14:17:27 Let's celebrate This, your fancy suit, bread, almost all your daily commodities go to white hands I'm not hearing you sayin ' damn this bread ' cause one thing is black, full black cast u remind us...haai suis man
110 2018-02-17 14:11:52 Animal agriculture is inherently abusive. Thinking of animals as commodities to be produced for the lowest cost possible and sold for the maximum profit possible is inherently abusive. This should not be a difficult concept to grasp.
111 2018-02-17 14:04:19 I also understand the tactic of people thinking theyre getting money from cook ups and keeping up conversations sending us other mail, frequenting 'facilities' with elders and "other people" or other commodities in question etc
112 2018-02-17 13:57:19 Same reason WTI crude only trades June and December contracts in out-years. Not enough market liquidity to support monthly contracts that far out. Many commodities only trade quarter-end months farther out.
113 2018-02-17 13:57:16 I think he deserved an answer! 
If we have gone so low to use the cost of commodities to measure government performance, then we should do it with facts and figures...
114 2018-02-17 13:42:57 Banning commodities doesn’t prevent people from getting them. Plants, guns, drugs, abortion, prostitution... banning just creates black markets and more violence
115 2018-02-17 13:36:38 Awesome! My grandparents received commodities. Fill that box with Government cheese, dry beans, can ham, potatoes.... um um good & good for you!
116 2018-02-17 13:32:12 For example - if lunch demand is uncertain (prices may go up or down), coupons are definitely speculative. The same way buying commodities is speculative even though a pork belly now is the same as a pork belly a year from now.
117 2018-02-17 13:31:38 We should have a meaningful discussion as Kenyan citizens. We can't continue to have a cycle of price escalations for certain commodities immediately after elections. A solidarity demonstration will also drive the point. It's too much!!! Total abuse of citizens.
118 2018-02-17 13:30:15 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
119 2018-02-17 13:19:27 I'm sure that the minerals and other commodities which the west values so highly will continue to somehow find their way out in spite of the chaos and carnage, just as they have since the days of King Leopold.
120 2018-02-17 13:13:56 "But nor is everyone comfortable with the trend towards treating women as breeding machines and babies as commodities."
121 2018-02-17 12:50:49 It's hard to writers to imagine a future with no scarse commodities that can justify a pseudo-capitalist economy. Even in Star Trek they had to introduce latinium to give motivation to Ferengi characters.
122 2018-02-17 12:38:05 The child's welfare is paramount. Take on the chin gays, you can't have kids. Get over it and get on with.
You condemn a poor child to God knows what through your vanity.
Children are not commodities.

125 2018-02-17 12:21:21 Más fácil aún: si el gobierno creyera sus propias proyecciones de inflación, no tendría problema en poner cláusula gatillo porque no debería de ser necesaria.

128 2018-02-17 11:43:30 Daily Mail: "But nor is everyone comfortable with the trend towards treating women as mere breeding machines and babies as commodities" - Y'all are aware that women CHOOSE to be surrogates, right? Fucking ridiculous "journalism"
129 2018-02-17 11:40:11 I think surrogacy is emotionally very risky. And has the risk of treating children as commodities. Taking unlicensed drugs to put your feelings above a child's welfare is wrong.

132 2018-02-17 11:36:45 Trading, on the other hand, involves the more frequent buying and selling of stock, commodities, currency pairs or other instruments, with the goal of generating returns that outperform buy-and-hold investing.
133 2018-02-17 11:36:05 This is a perfect example of how women are viewed by men though. Women are nothing but commodities for men. Sexual exploitation seen as nothing serious. No understanding of what was done to those women. His attitude is sickening and rage inducing.
134 2018-02-17 11:32:24 Fascinating. So now children are just commodities that can be gifted, stripped away from their mothers to be given to unnatural “families”
135 2018-02-17 11:29:30 I'd never heard of these before and I've just googled them to see what they were. They're sold here too! JFC, people are so sick! They want dogs to fit exactly into their precious orderly lives, treating dogs as commodities with no thought of it as a living, intelligent being.

137 2018-02-17 11:11:17 Look at the cartoon Stalford tweeted and the fact he wudnt take it down until one of the families contacted him to say. There were hurt by it. That proves that victims are nothing but commodities to them.

253 2018-02-18 23:06:23 Oh yes.  No doubt in my mind.  That whole group has no integrity; makes no difference to them.  All commodities are equal -- including life.
254 2018-02-18 23:05:04 3188: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
255 2018-02-18 23:01:31 There is no limited supply in wheat normally, but what happens when a hurricane or disaster hits farmlands?... price of affected commodities shoots up because the demand grows and the supply is limited.
256 2018-02-18 22:44:23 There's nothing good in Trump's budget. FFS, he wants to send people a box of commodities in place of part of their monthly food stamp benefit. Commodities is something you augment food stamps with, not replace them with.

258 2018-02-18 22:07:40 If you look at long-term commodity cycles, this is just the beginning. Shorter term, yes they were overbought so the pullback isn’t surprising but of all asset classes, long-term cycles hold true the strongest for commodities and this one has barely begun in historical standards
259 2018-02-18 21:56:01 he would get $34M for one year and be worth just as much or more next year. Player values don’t go down if they don’t play. They are rare commodities
260 2018-02-18 21:16:45 Man I lived my whole life on commodities and shit bc I'm Chickasaw and even going to Walmart is a luxury for us. Us natives get nothing but carbs and unsalted crackers and jump at any chance to eat with someone who can afford the good branded food.
261 2018-02-18 21:14:49 Ban fags, ban booze, ban fast food, ban ready meals, ban shampoo, ban perfumes.  Say no to the cancer causing shoddy commodities, don't be a slave. #fb
262 2018-02-18 21:11:51 White European women were the target.  Sex slaves.  White men were galley slaves.  They were targeted because: they were valuable commodities when sold in markets, they were non-Muslim, and they were white-skinned and attractive - "if they have blue eyes, the price is different!"
263 2018-02-18 21:11:39 In the case of commodities , I disagree....we can already see them pulling back from recent highs...
264 2018-02-18 20:46:55 I often wonder what will the prices of things be at the future considering that the price of things of certain commodities have increased gradually over few years. I think someday the price of chocolate might reach $1m .

265 2018-02-18 20:46:54 Commercial surrogacy of the type I suspect they have gone for, is banned in the EU and UK. That is because it exploits women and turns babies into commodities to be purchased. Surrogacy is extremely cruel. It deprives a child of its mother by deliberate intent.
266 2018-02-18 20:46:25 Keep your circle small, spend time and energy on quality... Quality across the board... quality time, quality experiences, and quality people. Time is one of the most precious of commodities... value and treat it as such.
267 2018-02-18 20:35:04 The mother and child are mere commodities to this wealthy young couple. A case of a woman selling not only her own body...
268 2018-02-18 20:27:07 I'm surprised gold is non-existent, unless it's part of that tiny ass commodities allocation.
269 2018-02-18 20:18:22 So many issues, but here’s a start: 
1. MEN CAN BE VIRGINS TOO 2. That’s not how vaginas work 3. Nobody can be used up 4. Women were not made for men 5. Virginity and women are not commodities . . .

273 2018-02-18 20:09:20 Nothing to complain about, #NYR Twitter. Everything is going exactly to plan. Valuable commodities are scoring ahead of trades and Rangers are losing games without gaining points. You can't craft a better result for the rest of this season.
274 2018-02-18 20:05:16 It mirrors the commodities given out on reservations.
275 2018-02-18 19:41:34 Renfroe will platoon at least this season, probably with Cordero. Both have reverse splits issues anyway. Preller has 2 or maybe 15 moves left in the tank. Trade OF depth, Headley, veteran rp’s, Naylor, and some fish tacos for a couple volatile commodities.
276 2018-02-18 19:40:41 Non so, mi par d'aver letto di lasciar stare gli agricoltori e di usar le biotecnologie solo in campo medico. Poi se non vogliamo far commodities mi sa che sia inevitabile segmentare il mercato e per inciso il danno da #piralide in italia é oltre il doppio di quello spagnolo.
277 2018-02-18 19:34:33 They used to call these non-perishable foods “commodities,” stored in bulk, distributed in county offices to families that qualified. Dried, powdered milk and eggs, bulk cheese. Quite lovely. 
278 2018-02-18 19:20:46 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
279 2018-02-18 19:19:48 Sale of a Canadian company to a Russian company. The horse had left the barn. There’s the xenophobia. American corporations aren’t American and deal in commodities regardless of ideology.

281 2018-02-18 19:09:27 You mean they're all labour market commodities with no time to do anything else other than work.
282 2018-02-18 19:05:37 yesterday i was writing a bunch about how adornment (fashion and jewellery and shit) in historical object research is a good middle ground because it's bound to both utilitarian use but links way more closely to identity than other commodities but now im not sure thats truuueeeee

294 2018-02-18 18:08:38 Vc. é um dos responsaveis pelo Brasil ter perdido o boom demográfico, o boom de commodities e a globalizacao. Foram tão incompetentes q. conseguiram em 13 anos transformar o país do futuro no país do atraso. É muita covardia falar dos problemas s/ assumir sua culpa. Shame on you!
295 2018-02-18 18:08:24 Pls can you define a country..Nigeria is a british business center and still remains so till date those who claim to be nigerians are still ignorance of his-story and will continue to be mere commodities for sale or for use..Nnamdi Kanu was kind enough to call it a zoo.
296 2018-02-18 18:03:57 Or prices have gone down for durable commodities that can be manufactured cheaply overseas or in Mexico.
297 2018-02-18 18:01:31 This is actually ridiculous.  Commodities as shown are basically a “use stock”, no value on reserves that secure equity and debt.  Cash likewise is presented as an unencumbered asset rather than linking to use (for example securing $500T in derivative contracts)
298 2018-02-18 17:49:38 Friday, I saw a girl curve a dude because he was wearing a Hollister hoodie, and all I could think of was Marx and social relations between commodities.

300 2018-02-18 17:41:53 Ok but let’s be fair: Big reason hospital costs have gone up is surge of hospital mergers reduce competition & increase quality. Colleges have diff kind of competition - they’re not commodities. The costs that are low are commodities with high competition.

Happy Weekend.
305 2018-02-18 17:04:31 Wen did u commodities develop self respect? After all commodities r sold not respected. Tats wat dowry is.
306 2018-02-18 16:56:21 2/ Even if you don't believe in the value of digital commodities (like Bitcoin = digital gold), then it's hard to conclude that the entire value of all other blockchain platforms combined will be worth less than just 1 large corporation of today.
307 2018-02-18 16:53:10 1/ My expectations are based on reasoning that the ENTIRE of crypto, which includes both (digital) commodities like Bitcoin AND platforms which provide a variety of enterprises uses, COMBINED, must be worth more than 1x the market cap of 1 large corp such as Amazon or Facebook.
308 2018-02-18 16:43:16 Same? At ur place newly weds r treated like commodities. Wat use is being brahmin if u walk around with a price tag.

311 2018-02-18 16:19:01 I stand behind the statement even out of context. Industrialization was the story that all consumer goods were commodities, particularly from 1945-90. Giving a shit about what you’re buying across the board is a relatively new concept.
312 2018-02-18 16:16:07 Leider nicht. So war zum Beispiel das Insiderwissen wann BCH auf Coinbase handelbar wurde, nicht strafbar, da es sich um Commodities handelt.
313 2018-02-18 16:13:12 Zimbabwe banks started buying commodities in the hyperinflation instead of bonds. I wonder if commercial banks in similar circumstances would look at crypto this time.
314 2018-02-18 16:13:02 Take a short interest in agricultural commodities using Gartley patterns to micro-hedge downside risk.
315 2018-02-18 16:06:19 Let him fudge the figures. Let him keep the prices of commodities & petrol prices down. It is simple he can't manage the country finance. Economy is in very bad shape.

324 2018-02-18 15:39:00 It was a prediction, I was pointing out UKGov made assumptions too, which were wrong. Clearly you don't understand that predictions are not accurate and anyone with half a brain would understand that commodities rise and fall
325 2018-02-18 15:25:31 Definitely looking at shorting some commodities particularly oil next week as well
326 2018-02-18 15:23:55 The formation of value chains across agricultural commodities will sort out the mess in the sector - Marketing only works when there is a defined, consistent and reliable value chain.
327 2018-02-18 15:20:13 The APL Card Holders would get 5 KG of riceat Rs 15 per Kg and 5 kg of wheat at Rs 10 a KG, besides palm oil and other commodities, at subsidized rates.

329 2018-02-18 14:45:19 Given how quickly #Commodities can empty one's wallet, it seems most reasonable.
330 2018-02-18 14:44:09 The auction house is an often forgotten stop on the voyage from birth to slaughter, but it's one of the most repugnant, at least symbolically. It represents one of the clearest and most naked celebrations of the animals-as-commodities paradigm, which I fundamentally reject.
331 2018-02-18 14:31:24 I will paraphrase! Money accumulated throughout time in a normal systematic fashion back by commodities ! Milestone: 1970's fed reserve..let's just print money..screw it, people are dumb anyhow!

349 2018-02-18 12:12:27 high oil prices in the 1970s delayed Soviet collapse by 10 years, or at least Soviet withdrawl from the cold war. on the other hand, I can't imagine so much 3rd world adventurism in the 1970s without the energy and commodities boom.

414 2018-02-18 00:47:17 Technology is rapidly advancing, almost exponentially so

If that can enable us to sustainably make all commodities post-scarcity (which I'm inclined to believe is possible down the road), distribution then becomes the only thing that stands between us and true utopia
415 2018-02-18 00:43:28 Capitalism ensures that post-scarcity commodities are never made universal

Just as authoritarian states are reluctant to give up power, so are those who have dominated a market that now has enough of the goods in question for everyone
416 2018-02-18 00:38:22 I feel like it says a lot about you, that you use images of women being used up or consumed during sex. We are not commodities. We are not your property. And for god’s’ sake, we are not food products.
417 2018-02-18 00:38:18 Most "market competition" fetishists don't realize that, with some commodities, we have already attained post-scarcity

We have enough homes and food for everyone, and yet those *aren't* distributed well

Capitalism creates a false scarcity in these markets to enable profiteering
418 2018-02-18 00:34:03 My view is that we we take a broader view of Agricutlture and pick several core commodities we can export. Sugar will have challenges and we need to consolidate whilst developing the new Commercial agri economy.
419 2018-02-18 00:21:07 Sure commodities existed, but their production did not dominate society as the primary goal of social labor. The production of commodities, ie goods for exchange, as the main form of production is a defining characteristic of capitalism.
420 2018-02-18 00:08:31 Now when a country or bloc of countries imports or exports goods and commodities it may choose to impose a tariff. And there are a number of reasons why it might choose to do so and they don't all involve protecting a native industry or farmers.

497 2018-02-16 19:42:30 My mom used to get commodities, we used to make peanut butter cookies and oatmeal cookies. Plus they would give us canned meats. It’s a lot of good food, but you do need to know how to cook.
498 2018-02-16 19:40:25 Most hot commodities are assholes. Its how they become such hot commodities.
499 2018-02-16 19:38:31 Gee, sir, I thought you appreciated your Turks more than that. If nothing else we are valuable Shin-Ra commodities, and I would think you would not want to throw away investments. In any case, this is not a helpful or sympathetic suggestion.

518 2018-02-16 18:36:44 The epic battle we're witnessing for #BTC around the $10k mark shows that the crypto market is still in its early stages. In more mature markets such as commodities or forex a "round figure" per se never constitutes a point of resistance/support, it's just psychological!

609 2018-02-16 13:01:15 Exchange rate is important when you import commodities such as oil so the lower the rate the better for the economy balance of transactions. The country will spend less money for more goods and services hence there will be surplus this will make prices to drop.

616 2018-02-16 12:37:20 Treat passengers like commodities seems your latest philosophy - aircraft yet to park but outbound passengers asked to queue up! So much for customer centricity. @IndiGo6E @AdityaGhosh6E
617 2018-02-16 12:32:05 Yes, I've seen this happen with commodities.  I volunteer at a food pantry and I also am a member of a Facebook talk and swap group. I see people selling the food frequently.

621 2018-02-16 12:15:01 But as a person who trades cryptos I've come to release that their prices follow the same pattern as many stock and commodities.. With just a little more volatility due to the bastardized free market
622 2018-02-16 12:09:42 Sorry, in the WSJ in around 1995-1998 there was an article that listed most stressful jobs. Commodities trader in the PIT was under police, fire fighter, and sky diver. But that was in the PIT not sitting behind a computer screen.

626 2018-02-16 11:38:20 The UK used to import huge volumes of commodities from places like Africa and the Caribbean before EC protectionism, they already had the infrastructure. The problem was that subsidies in the EU meant that EU production was being dumped on their markets at subsidised prices.

630 2018-02-16 11:13:37 If only we can produce our own common commodities then maybe we would save, but if we are  held down by politics and duty politicians what do we  expect. This goes across all side's.

636 2018-02-16 10:49:21 Once all the commodities are traded on the block chain with true price discovery and all the manipulation ends, then we will see the true price of gold, silver, petro, currency, etc... It also means US hegemony ends with the PetroDollar's end, and finally the wars will end.

662 2018-02-16 08:38:16 I am sure you know how ridiculous the price of basic commodities is, and one of the biggest reasons for such high prices is middle men... blockchain technology is doing away with middle men so you can buy any product from anyone without needing to go through middle men

681 2018-02-16 07:00:56 perhaps instead of cryptocurrencies you could use cryptoassets to be all inclusive. There are more than 40,000 of the things and some seek to act like currencies eg @Dashpay others want to be stores of value like MakerDao and others are commodities
682 2018-02-16 06:54:49 Bit I thought commodities prices were supposed to be determined by the laws of supply & Demand. If the demand goes up & the supply is low shouldn't prices rise? In a free market that is unregulated by outside forces?

690 2018-02-16 05:50:23 Nothing will the masses achieve through capitalist society, a capitalist regime is not ideal for the majority poor people. Wages are deliberately kept low for their ulterior motives. Strengthening Rand has no positive effect on your salary, bread price or local commodities

692 2018-02-16 05:42:28 Commodities/services cannot be rights. Rights determine access, they don’t give you the right to stuff that people had to spend money and time and take risks to obtain. Those aren’t rights, that’s theft of ones property and labor.

718 2018-02-16 02:56:56 I think the whole Internet of Things is being driven by the fact that software is naturally "communist", and the capitalist system needs to shoehorn it into commodities somehow.
