8 2018-08-09 23:14:44 The fall away in price inflation is happening in commodities. The fact that real goods are falling in price even though the amount of global currency is maxed tells you that the US currency is having a difficult time valuing “real” goods!!

39 2018-08-09 21:33:30 Viewpoints and ability to speak or write used to be marketable commodities.  
Losing those valuable assets would be a difficult change to adjust to for people who fear change, and condemn people who fear change.
40 2018-08-09 21:33:23 Thank goodness others see the truth as well. After all, we’re only sheeple to those that own us anyway. Disposable commodities to further their own agenda.

42 2018-08-09 21:23:01 “That does not mean the United States will no longer buy foreign oil or energy commodities. It means the United States will sell more oil and energy products overseas than it imports.”

So @GovMikeHuckabee has no idea what he’s talking about.

45 2018-08-09 20:53:36 @BigDrewandJim I think a great aspect of this is that it humanizes he and Kate a ton

Sports fans too often view athletes as robots, commodities

From afar, he and Kate are together because they're talented, beautiful people. That relationship is far deeper than people think.
46 2018-08-09 20:51:51 Farmers. Commodities are traded at an institutional level now. I took a commodities class way back in the 80's. No one wins at an individual level. With the new tech available now and all the hedging, farmers will feel the brunt. Markets will play the long game.
47 2018-08-09 20:41:36 Well in Canada, that'd be impressive. Since we don't have *naturalised* bananas and all. 

But I'm pretty sure that's all international trade is, is just a refined barter system that imposes made-up figures on commodities, products, and resources.
48 2018-08-09 20:39:11 Futures and the commodities market must be in a huge disarray.
49 2018-08-09 20:38:20 Sure, I mean, that's how international trade works, I guess. But why not USE our oil domestically, sell the excess for the most we can get for it (profit) and SELL commodities and resources other countries DON'T grow/make/produce/manufacture.

I know it's more complicated.
50 2018-08-09 20:32:38 The definition in question being 
A. Are cryptocurrencies Legal Tender under the coinage act.And no they are not. But are they :
B. Virtual Currencies  under the purview of Currencies as described under RBI Act.
C. Goods/commodities.
D. securities
Is what is to be decided.
51 2018-08-09 20:25:15 Yes, I've been saying this for a while. Apple can get away with a premium price for a variety of reasons, Android phones are more like commodities.

57 2018-08-09 19:54:50 It's coming ...

... although nowhere to save now. Interest rates flat-lining as yield desperate in Japan et al soak up US treasuries (for now). All sharemarkets going sideways until The Great Reset.  Commodities falling (gold has no gains). Stimulunacy has broken the world.
58 2018-08-09 19:52:24 @RaoulGMI brought it up this morning, and it's definately worth circling back too.  EURO has been drifting lower all day, right to that pivotal $1.15 neckline.  If it breaks, I'll guarantee you all hell breaks loose across multiple asset classes!  Stocks, commodities the biggest
59 2018-08-09 19:47:08 No. You just need to understand what a guitar is and what the
guitar market is. You can not treat a niche market like a general
commodities market. That business model does not work. They
found that out the hard way.

62 2018-08-09 19:34:52 The creeps who film to make their own port:  Definitely.
Men with gender-dysphoria who identify as women:  How do they see women as commodities?  Do they see themselves as commodities, too?
63 2018-08-09 19:32:45 i thought its wrong to see women as commodities?

67 2018-08-09 19:09:19 I feel sorry for those trying to chase this morning on the pop only to get hoodwinked. The #USD is in full control here and is the reason #commodities are being suppressed, but the longer we stay lower, the higher the price of #CrudeOil, #Gold & #Copper will be in the future.
68 2018-08-09 19:05:43 .@fa should spend their time regulating agents who treat players, fans and clubs as percentage based contemptuous commodities. Regulation is essential or you will lose control of the game you govern.
69 2018-08-09 18:55:42 Tu fuente es C5N todo dicho. Tienen todas las evidencias a la vista y siguen defendiendo, realmente incomprensible. No hicieron una obra de infraestructura en 12 años, con recaudaciones y precios de commodities record! Se fueron con 30% de pobres!!!
70 2018-08-09 18:49:41 You're right, cost to the community of burning fossil fuels etc, has to be reflected in the price of commodities & services that cause CO2 pollution, which is the cause of CC. However, as our corps, politicians, media, & a large no. of us are greedy & cynical, it's not happening.
71 2018-08-09 18:47:58 Further, such ownership is simply impractical if there is a surplus of the commodities you demand. Why would you exercise violence for a resource when it is fundamentally not necessary?
72 2018-08-09 18:43:39 6. etc. Afghanistan and others have rare earths.  Congress should back our money with gold, silver, other valuable commodities, federal government owned lands, etc to reduce the rate of inflation - destruction in buying power of our money over time.

78 2018-08-09 18:07:28 Can I ask where you receive most of you information? Who are your sources? We are in business for ourselves & have seen our commodities tumble - major losses.

87 2018-08-09 17:43:08 I think the board is scared to sign the promising young players that are hot commodities after Memphis. Bailly, Lindelof, Martial, Dalot were all relatively unspoken about in the press.
88 2018-08-09 17:40:22 Printing & borrowing cause prices on all commodities & services to rise due to inflation & a devalued dollar, we are dealing with that on an ongoing basis.

89 2018-08-09 17:38:33 Y así con todo, no se toma dimensión real de la bomba que dejaron en economía. Nunca más vamos a tener precios en commodities récord, tasas bajas, un mundo no tan enquilombado, etc, etc. Fueron el gob más corrupto que existió. Pero administrando eran peor

91 2018-08-09 17:35:20 Much harder for the Chinese Communist Party to engage in a 'trade war' with the United States since the imports they are targeting are raw commodities with inflexible supply curves. 1/3
92 2018-08-09 17:29:52 I saw this yesterday. Another example of using animals as commodities or toys--things that can be exploited for profit or amusement. We need to encourage recognition that animals are sentient beings, like us, with the same desire to live and not be mistreated.
93 2018-08-09 17:27:24 They're actresses. When the know they're being photographed, they do what they have to do. Regrettably, actresses are promoted as commodities.
94 2018-08-09 17:23:54 They were champions when Kd joined them they won 73 games the year before he joined them. They were proven and established commodities.Your point of organically made is irrelevant bc they were stars when Kd joined
95 2018-08-09 17:23:25 Mam...you are completely entitled to believe whatever you want to and I admire your conviction to those...but I don’t believe that there is a separation between politics and money no matter who the president....it is the way the world works. I work in commodities. See it daily
96 2018-08-09 17:22:54 Why did the society ever had to evolve? The social construct where you have to work to fill your stomach is so upsetting. Why can’t basic commodities be free?

98 2018-08-09 16:54:44 Hate, prejudice, and elitism are America's most lucrative commodities. Exhibits A-G: Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, Sean Hannity, Donald Trump...
99 2018-08-09 16:53:32 Also ignores the other countries geographical position. Singapore South East Asia (financial hub). Australia - Raw commodities China/Japan (Car manufacturing now dead) NZ. Relatively small economy. Canada - US Border.

101 2018-08-09 16:44:16 commodities , energy , retail still wide open, etc
102 2018-08-09 16:41:57 Commodities cannot be human rights. All commodities require the police power of the State to force others to create or distribute them. Human rights are things that are inherent/exist without the use of force. Rights always exist unless taken from you. Speech, thought, life, etc.
103 2018-08-09 16:40:46 Most companies are reporting inflationary pressures in commodities, labor, and freight costs.
104 2018-08-09 16:37:13 1. Will bitcoin absorb all existing fiat and debt? 

2. Will bitcoin compete with other stores of value /commodities in the future, or do you see other cryptocurrencies naturally taking the place of certain financial products / systems where bitcoin might not be the first choice?

109 2018-08-09 16:12:27 What are digital tokens - securities, commodities, currencies, property?  @josh_blockchain walks us through different token types. #BlockLegalTech
110 2018-08-09 16:09:49 Indeed there is a lack of correlation currently in the crypto markets, but as more institutional pathways open to the space I expect a correlation to arise between #crypto and traditional assets, #stock, #bonds, #commodities. Agree with the investment thesis though.
111 2018-08-09 16:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
112 2018-08-09 16:06:33 Don’t agree with badge kissing or how he got transfer, but getting stick for lack of loyalty? Footballers nowadays are commodities, easily & readily tradable to any club globally. Clubs generally aren’t loyal to players (always exceptions) so why expect footballers to be?
113 2018-08-09 16:05:08 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by “opinions” when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.

116 2018-08-09 15:35:38 Without Africa Europe will be bankrupted :) and th  Euro, Pound and US Dollar will collapse because all these currencies are trading according to our commodities and when we control our export and import of gold in SA the ZAR will be stronger than the dollar and you’ll cry :)

118 2018-08-09 15:31:19 Yes. But unlike other scarce commodities all land is not made the same. In the long run factors like climate change or crime or just popularity can affect land prices. Just about 20 years ago suburbs were popular, now big cities again.

121 2018-08-09 15:25:00 I dont get why people are so happy in currency conversion lalo na pag malaki yung halaga ng piso sa foreign currency. Please, know Inflation. Kailangan tumaas ang GDP natin not the prices of commodities!!!

123 2018-08-09 15:12:13 I'm not disputing that the dollar will fall, but not now.  If you think there is a "rotation" then the assumption is its benign.  Yet a disruption, which I expect, will hammer demand.  If global demand falls, then commodities except likely ag get hammered.  that's market physics
124 2018-08-09 15:11:15 The case of increasing price would also affect the basic commodities and the scale of affecting people will demand the gap shortened.But this is not only a case of controlling country's revenue but also how common Man could survive within limitations that they face in the market.
125 2018-08-09 15:11:06 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food
126 2018-08-09 15:05:02 Good luck with that one. 

Commodities is where you need reps even more, it's what differentiates one brand from another. 

Price wars only go so far and kill companies.  

Sales reps who bring value pay for themselves.

134 2018-08-09 14:30:22 eventually yes absolutely, but in a panic people will still go or stay in the dollar. EM's like Turkey, Argentina, Russia and Brazil won't go up until the US prints and commodities recover.  Industrial commodities will get creamed because demand falls in a worldwide recession.

139 2018-08-09 14:22:13 I recall the dollar jumping from 24/- to 35/- in a very short span, and things have never recovered. Prices of commodities shot up. My folks were gnashing teeth, with high cost of living and some of my siblings and I heading to high school...

186 2018-08-09 10:59:49 Funny that you should use gasoline as your example.  Doubling its price has very little impact on its demand. Economists use the term inelastic demand to describe commodities that don't follow the typical price - demand relationship

242 2018-08-09 04:07:30 Se vc pode investir em qualquer coisa, poderia pensar em corporates de empresas como $AAPL e $MSFT pela rentabilidade, ou commodities
Vai da preferencia de risco e horizonte de investimento.
243 2018-08-09 04:05:32 Como en varios otros aspectos, los “enemigos” serán los ganones a partir de las sanciones de Trump a Irán. Autos, maquinaria y commodities a la venta sin competencia gringa.

244 2018-08-09 04:02:00 Unborn baby body parts are not commodities....like car parts stop this!
245 2018-08-09 03:45:06 Chicago has a history of gang violence surrounding prohibition. The majority of these shootings were gang related. Most gang violence today is directly related to the war on drugs and the black market commodities created by it.
246 2018-08-09 03:40:55 "Looking at commodities, oil (NYSEARCA:USO) is the only one that's up since 1/26 [2018], while gold (NYSEARCA:GLD), silver (NYSEARCA:SLV), and natural gas (NYSEARCA:UNG) are all down more than 10%. Fixed income markets are down slightly as well."

247 2018-08-09 03:39:41 AND what do YOU exactly mean by that???!!! Do YOU want me to go back to Northern Virginia or back on the Slaveship my ancestors were unwillingly put on to come to “The New World” as commodities into a lifetime of servitude????
248 2018-08-09 03:33:55 1/ Here’s a little (true) story of how technology + capitalism worsens life quality by converting people into commodities.
249 2018-08-09 03:25:17 I want it to be where women are just commodities again. Buy sell and trade, they dont need rights when they're richer than peasants.
250 2018-08-09 03:23:52 Opinions can be picked up cheap in the market place while such commodities as courage and fortitude and faith are in alarmingly short supply.

251 2018-08-09 03:21:30 Have you seen the prices on Square-Enix CDs? And how many albums they keep in print? It's one of the company's most-valued commodities.
252 2018-08-09 03:21:21 Perdão, Hassan. No Brasil, ainda temos tendência de alta, pela retomada do mercado interno. Com a devida prudência de correções fruto da expansão do dólar e redução das commodities. Mas quanto mais os meses passarem, mais devemos estar com o alerta ligado.

255 2018-08-09 03:19:37 Unfortunately, guns are now disposable commodities with little investment value.  Far too often these days, their owners treat them as such.  While not a Darwin Award candidate yet, he came close.  Hopefully he'll live to treat guns with a little more respect.

258 2018-08-09 03:14:09 If you're buying your bulk commodities from Russia, stop.  Look to Brazil, Australia, Canada.  If you live in Pennsylvania, go out in your back yard & frack.  Stop importing Russian natural gas for your hot tub!

262 2018-08-09 03:00:19 We also were not chosen and I'm annoyed because if you want to talk about commercialization of LEO, focusing on ISS misses the larger picture of actual markets for space commodities that will drive the space economy.
263 2018-08-09 02:51:22 Not at all, there are just better ways and people should understand that the "banks money" is actually people's livelihood and retirement accounts. If it does spread to the automakers, 45,000 is a lot of jobs not even counting what we have already lost on commodities.
264 2018-08-09 02:48:12 Maybe not, but I’m not about to dog him, or any kid for that matter.  They are Gators and deserve to be treated right by us, they aren’t commodities.
265 2018-08-09 02:45:20 Mañana Tito Pabón va a innocar en las rutas metabólicas alternativas y le va a decir adiós a sus materias primas.
Adiós commodities, adiós a la extracción, ahora los celulares y la pintura se harán realidad con la glucogénesis.
266 2018-08-09 02:13:23 Unemployment, corruptions in Government Sector and PSUs (Government of India under taking and/or Private) are  continue. Price hike of essential commodities are on extreme. Purchasing power has come down. Highly educated persons are moving with out job.
267 2018-08-09 02:06:55 *CHINA'S CSI 300 INDEX EXTENDS GAIN TO 1%
Roll out if commodities into stocks
268 2018-08-09 02:06:21 Commodities are the opium of the people.
269 2018-08-09 02:04:32 You are going to trade commodities all night and get time to tweet once every month or two?
270 2018-08-09 02:03:54 celebrity spottings are not hot commodities in ATL. u just assume that josh hutcherson is probably going to sit next to you at the nearest boba shop
271 2018-08-09 02:00:24 Wait so @Elliotitsyours by the #NCAA letting elite students have agemts does that also authorize them to recieve financial gifts or equivalent commodities?
272 2018-08-09 01:57:04 Short currencies/commodities. Expected return is lower (sometimes positive if its in contango) and people like cheaper materials. Also a winner for every short in FX land
273 2018-08-09 01:55:04 There's a school of thought that China should buy all its commodities to the US to lower the deficit and cultivate special interests
274 2018-08-09 01:54:39 «Fixed an issue where trade commodities were not available for sale in the space station»
Well, that explains why I couldn’t find star silk anywhere
275 2018-08-09 01:45:23 The government should have stuck to its guns and banned greyhound racing. I cannot abide cruelty to animals. They are NOT commodities, they are sentient beings and deserve our respect.
276 2018-08-09 01:35:10 Quick question: why did you choose to apply TA to crypto rather than stocks, currencies or commodities?
277 2018-08-09 01:30:17 Cost of living is going up. Prices of essential commodities, rice, fish, spices and vegetables are on the increase. Around 1.2 million of the country's 160 million people earn $2.0 a day.
278 2018-08-09 01:23:07 May dagdag bayad ba tong pagclassify ko ng commodities ng client nyo? Oy kuha kuha din ng declarant ano po?
279 2018-08-09 01:20:34 There is a breaking point yuknow.
The devaluations coupled with energy prices will eventually lead to social unrest.
The inputs of basic commodities increasing and will also get passed unto consumers.
280 2018-08-09 01:13:13 China also gets 25- to 35-year contracts for below-market prices from struggling companies & countries

to flood other markets w cheap goods/commodities & crush competitors. Or manipulate markets to create inflation & deflation to destabilize or collapse entire economies.
281 2018-08-09 01:12:49 A1: A lot more than I used to, thanks to @UnitedSoy. Turns out waterways are the most economical & green transport option for commodities. And our system is crumbling. #AgBookClub
282 2018-08-09 01:04:01 These are petroleum-based products/commodities. Recyclables - even if not all petro-based - need to be transported and processed using petroleum derived energy.
283 2018-08-09 00:56:03 The difference is the Colombian cabin aka Fortaleza does have ac and power and all the commodities but the us's cabin for losers is better than colombias loser house cause it has no electricity and 3 walls 
284 2018-08-09 00:53:38 Somethings aren’t imaginary commodities. Other assets actually can create something. These things trade easily in markets on the other hand crypto crap will eventually trade to zero. Yes, that’s my opinion, so good luck with your race to riches.

287 2018-08-09 00:42:16 Goalies with prior USHL experience are hot commodities. No goalie at tryout camp had USHL experience. This is a no brainer move, imo. You plug him in right away and don't have to worry about him adjusting to the league. He's been there and won.
288 2018-08-09 00:37:02 Divorced women and single moms create their own hardships by not choosing the right man and also by not being a woman worthy of the right man— essentially by being disposal commodities. Most women offer no value proposition and they pay a heavy price for being low quality.
289 2018-08-09 00:32:01 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.
290 2018-08-09 00:20:04 That's beside the point. When the current diplomats are finished with this country we would have sale for our commodities.
291 2018-08-09 00:13:39 To increase future purchasing power.  Whether that means commodities in BTC or an (hopefully) increase in my fiat it really doesnt matter.....if rocks suddenly became valuable and you could exchange them for desired goods you would......the vessel for barter is meaningless...
292 2018-08-09 00:07:48 My gut tells me like most commodities BTC value is being artificially suppressed
