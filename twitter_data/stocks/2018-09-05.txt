People are working.
Economy=booming.
Stocks are up.
Not taking crap from other countries.
Wanting to secure our border.
Strengthening our military.
Supporting our police.
Fulfilling campaign promises.

Yeah, unprecedented alright, in a good way!

41 2018-09-05 23:46:19 I cant believe the selling in Chinese stocks. Especialy the fundamentally strong like $baba gettin dragged lower despite record revenue growth. Eventually the snapback up will b just as violent as the elavator down. But tryin to catch this falling knife has grenaded many accounts

48 2018-09-05 23:44:05 Nike’s stocks aren’t up it’s still down 3 points since they put the ad out
49 2018-09-05 23:43:26 They have money and suspending people would probably make them lose money (stocks maybe idk)
50 2018-09-05 23:43:11 Nike is one of the most stable stocks to buy and hold with a dividend it’s a great growth investment. In case y’all wanted to invest frfr
51 2018-09-05 23:43:08 Poor performing technology stocks and continuing trade tensions continue to weigh on Wall Street. The Dow Jones rose about 0.09%. The S&P 500 fell 0.28%, while the Nasdaq fell about 1.19%. The local AUS200 index could follow suit.
52 2018-09-05 23:42:51 Nike will never end, but Kaepernick is the down fall for Nike in the stocks as of now but also he will be a positive impact to the world
53 2018-09-05 23:42:26 It's ridiculous that every time BTC dumps all alts dump. This has been going on for years. Enough! We need a better solution. If IBM stocks plummet all other stocks don't crash. Screw the miners, whales, and the drama!  BTC is archaic, slow, and expensive. What say you?
54 2018-09-05 23:42:17 Okay gais I've ordered 4 extra stocks of Nature Republic California Aloe Powdery Sunstick! It's RM45 each excluding postage ~
55 2018-09-05 23:41:37 You are Big Brother, not John Galt. Your stocks just went down 10 points.
56 2018-09-05 23:40:11 Most people who wear Nike don't own stocks, so you know Nike ain't trippin over their stock being down.
57 2018-09-05 23:39:48 It is time!
58 2018-09-05 23:39:26 The past few days we’ve seen the worse selloff in Emerging Markets since the financial crisis, this is not good for Cryptos...

72 2018-09-05 23:30:02 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks
73 2018-09-05 23:29:42 Not so weird when you consider there are no knife bump-stocks, or acid that has 30-round clips. Look, we get it that there are crazies everywhere, but here we just let them get armed to the teeth.
74 2018-09-05 23:29:38 I Disagree if this Country had the right mind set as to know the right issues in which he is kneeling for!!!! Wall Street lol pleeeeeaaaase don’t act like u know the mind set or care y’all care about money but sit back and watch the movement and readjust ur stocks
75 2018-09-05 23:29:30 U expand Clintons work requirements to insult Americans, u will get what u deserve. Treasons. We'll work when we want to.

80 2018-09-05 23:28:06 Yep.  Another high risk - high reward play as are all microcap biotech stocks.  (nods)

There will be an explosion in R&D upon decrim and that IP is money but again, small cap bio is as risky as it gets.
81 2018-09-05 23:27:37 $ID8 to list this month on back of 11 mill $ IPO raise heavily taken up by funds/instos. Blockchain around payment security currently live with HSBC. Tech stocks currently getting some love so looking 4ward to $ID8 on the boards this month.
82 2018-09-05 23:27:37 I'm skeptical of Chinese stocks, primarily because they have no compunctions about screwing over foreign investors, it's difficult to trust any information that originates from China and their rapid economic boom seems to have slowed. It may even slide into recession.
83 2018-09-05 23:26:50 With Starbucks stores... They have Dansai water... etc... shares rose 4% upon this news...Dunkin has $6 billion value in comparison to $72 billion for Starbucks...* popptarts team up with Dunkn... Lastly: the stocks: yesterday: Dow Jones:

90 2018-09-05 23:24:51 This was probably Mammarosa . She just had to get a last dig in. If it wasn't the reality star that's  in search of a bottle for the lightning her tiny shiny star is wielding,  then forage the rat out by the nose and throw them in the stocks...
91 2018-09-05 23:23:51 i dont know people are so stupid Nike is not being affected by this one bit their stocks went from $82.18 to $79.01 and now it’s back up lol

100 2018-09-05 23:18:53 No reason to #UndoIt, it's their position and at least they've had the decency to be transparent about it. Now we are free to #BoycottNike and happily watch their stocks fall. #MAGA
101 2018-09-05 23:18:52 Defensive rotation and money flows!!! It’s paid Asset Managers to NOT own pharma the last few years so the exposure is still very low. Plenty more to room to run for these stocks.

In other words, he is the only person who matters in the world. THIS IS DIRECT EVIDENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS.
104 2018-09-05 23:17:04 @Nike stocks are up today. Huh.

108 2018-09-05 23:14:44 2/2- Bump stocks, one use in 10 yrs.. Still aiming too low. The Parkland idiot used 10 round mags. Santa Fe HS, no mags at all. What does this ban accomplish? States do need to toughen punishment for negligence...

111 2018-09-05 23:14:04 Okay so how do I buy Nike stocks?
112 2018-09-05 23:13:48 I heard about those apps but I also heard it’s a really bad way to invest in stocks have you heard anything like that before?
113 2018-09-05 23:13:23 No more Nike shoes or gear for me!! @Nike @Kaepernick7 @walkaway @realDonaldTrump @VP  watch stocks fall!!!
114 2018-09-05 23:12:53 Getting killed?? Not according to their stocks. Trying to give you the benefit of the doubt but all you do is lie and over exaggerate. Such arrogance. No place in heaven for you with being that disgraceful. And I thought Obama was an idiot.
115 2018-09-05 23:12:29 Stocks go up and down..This won’t break Nike nor will it spoil market..it’s all calculated risk
116 2018-09-05 23:12:27 Their stocks were up today at close, dumb-Bell.
117 2018-09-05 23:12:13 @finimize I am patiently waiting for your analysis of Nike's stocks
118 2018-09-05 23:12:08 Invest heavily in BAN Roll-On & Nike dry-weave product Stocks
119 2018-09-05 23:10:41 I noticed this an hour after the bell rang yesterday. I was also aware that you cant tell people things they don't know about the Market. Like the #1 rule.. NEVER Buy or sell stocks based on emotion.
120 2018-09-05 23:10:36 No, taxpayers didn’t cover it. Maybe, you should know how insurance works, before you make stupid comments. You most certainly are not welcome.
121 2018-09-05 23:10:35 I’m just saying facts Celeste, if most military families liked the CK movement their stocks shoulda went up right? Maybe im missing something on the 3 billion stock drop.

123 2018-09-05 23:09:23 To get a stock price you get the average price between buyers and sellers

Nike is up .40%

Those stock dumpers only sold their stocks to investor that are not suffering from weak emotions like them.

129 2018-09-05 23:05:49 I know this feeling. I have every day this one question in my head: Should I ramp up my position? Why only 50 stocks short, if I could have 75?
130 2018-09-05 23:04:57 interesting. one thing i think would be interesting would be a momentum VIP stocks index to track sentiment - would include some of the names you have there but probably a bit more tech names and maybe some super momo weed stocks, shopify, etc.
131 2018-09-05 23:04:04 Hog stocks in China could be devastated by the #ASF outbreak. Tariffs add an interesting dynamic, too. Someone, somewhere will benefit from this. Just not the piggies

134 2018-09-05 23:03:03 You mean the taxpayers covered it, right? We subsidized you via the ACA. You're welcome.
135 2018-09-05 23:02:49 How about universal background checks, 21 to buy a gun,
Ban sales of ar15 and similar weaponsfrom sales to the citizens, ban bump stocks and large magazines,
Safe storage laws and prosecution of those don’t store safely with kids in home.
136 2018-09-05 23:02:47 Ya you know how stocks work. Pay attention to it in a month.

139 2018-09-05 23:01:47 Listen up Nike! You folks have stepped in big time because the power of the purse is going to FUBAR your stocks. You can believe this.......
140 2018-09-05 23:01:29 You haven't done Adam thing since being there! You brag about stocks..lmao
141 2018-09-05 23:00:52 I’m runnin back to stocks cause the 30 jammed
142 2018-09-05 23:00:23 Just got into a convo about how I don’t see Nike’s stocks actually going down given there is a larger population of people supporting CK than opposing him and his movement. Thanks for this!

144 2018-09-05 22:59:45 So you don’t know how stocks work. Thanks for clarifying that
145 2018-09-05 22:59:38 FANG is the acronym for four high-performing technology stocks: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google
146 2018-09-05 22:59:12 Just to let you guys know Nike stocks are 79 a piece

148 2018-09-05 22:58:26 2. Stocks make money in other ways, other than just selling for a higher price. Dividends, profit sharing, stock splitting, are all ways.
149 2018-09-05 22:57:57 Emerging market stocks led declines in indexes globally Wednesday,as investors moved defensively,with a deadline in the U.S.-China trade conflict looming.

153 2018-09-05 22:55:55 I want to put $200 per month for at least 10 years into a "pot" of cannabis stocks.  What would your recommendation be, at least for the forseeable future?
154 2018-09-05 22:55:20 Nah...! Nike is doing just fine; in fact, the stocks have gone up.
155 2018-09-05 22:54:56 Bought a share of Amazon after your show on capitalism. Next, other stocks for kids bdays!
156 2018-09-05 22:53:16 hmmmm.....today stocks for nike are up.  gee, I thought the right was going to 'ruin' nike.
157 2018-09-05 22:53:10 Lmao stocks did shit today
158 2018-09-05 22:52:49 I believe Nike is honest with the Kap campaign but they stocks and shit finna skyrocket after all this decline ..black money is powerful .
159 2018-09-05 22:51:51 We have always been a trend following market, not trend setting. 60% of the stocks follow speculation. Rest 40% is earnings and global cues. Valuation doesn't justify where we are, it only builds the narrative of fastest growing but only on paper. No one knows the "why's" here.
160 2018-09-05 22:51:38 Didn't do any work today, but I did update my goals for the next 3 months, but 3 new stocks and pay a bill off today. I'd say that's still productive.
161 2018-09-05 22:51:32 $MSCP ok i missed $BLSP but I try to find the real Stocks for Potential!I don’t need advertise my Chat!Just relaxing 
162 2018-09-05 22:50:55 I don't know what's so funny, Nike is a global brand, they're not so fragile just because stocks tumbled here and there. The make over 35 billion a year and US consumers alone doesn't drive them. In the end they're going to win their bet and laugh at everyone who doubted them
163 2018-09-05 22:50:49 What happened to the separated Children?! What happened to DACA? What happened to banning bump stocks? What about infrastructure? More important than a #FarmBill!
164 2018-09-05 22:50:39 Hoje não fiz nada, só dormi e investi em Penny stocks
165 2018-09-05 22:48:26 Over many years partisan Sxros/Bilderberg supporters have been placed in leadership positions in govt, justice, police, military in most democracies. Quiet subtrefuge. Their strong arm is applied by Antifa + Sharia immigrants. Funds raised by shorting stocks in countries attacked
166 2018-09-05 22:47:49 Stocks under the radar - my favourite phrase! 
167 2018-09-05 22:46:08 I'd be unsurprised if wobbling has been one of the main reasons why Melee is still played with four stocks. That compensates the fact that players have exactly four chances to mess up their spacing before losing the match.
168 2018-09-05 22:45:48 @Arranwhisky can you tell me where (if anywhere) in Edinburgh stocks Arran gold? I'm almost out!
169 2018-09-05 22:44:42 ATN: A.) Cities can’t prosecute homeless for sleeping on streets... B.) F22 refines dogfighting And Air to air combat tactics... MYB: A.) Canada, US to restore trade talks... B.) stocks hover as traders cautious over trade... C.) Blood testing firm

172 2018-09-05 22:42:58 you do know that stocks are rising
173 2018-09-05 22:42:49 The Nasdaq index fell more than 1% o/n, dented by tech stocks after Facebook & Twitter executives defended their companies before sceptical US lawmakers. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 25 points lower at 6,190. #ausshares #stockmarket
174 2018-09-05 22:42:47 Currently buying Nike stocks 
175 2018-09-05 22:42:47 Just moved my stocks out of Nike!. Bye. Bye.
176 2018-09-05 22:42:36 Nike stocks still going up LMFAOO
177 2018-09-05 22:42:31 Mmm.. Nike's stocks haven't moved today.. What happened?  Your plan failed?
178 2018-09-05 22:42:10 Stocks up...
179 2018-09-05 22:41:55 Confirmation keeps us in the right stocks.
180 2018-09-05 22:40:26 The whole field of machine learning and neural networks cracks me up—the only thing people understand less about than computers is the brain, and some madman decided to duct tape the two together and tell the resulting monstrosity to try to drive a car and trade stocks
181 2018-09-05 22:39:39 Lastly, The world isn’t black and white, but the U.S. is a economic bank roll, so to tell you that Nike lost 3 BILLION! In stocks, shows that this isn’t the way. Like it or not the US is ran by money and they didn’t like the ad.
182 2018-09-05 22:39:07 Lol, people are selling their stocks and getting rid of them, but apparently Nike already knew what would happen but that the gains they’ll get will put weigh their loses since it’s capturing the attention of Generation Z.
183 2018-09-05 22:38:54 Lining his pockets by donating his salary? GDP 4.2%. Black and Hispanic unemployment lowest ever. Secured open free trade w/ Mexico. Stocks highest ever. Black voter approval up 15 % since he took office. Off the top of my head. Are you paying attn? More than competent, MSM lies
184 2018-09-05 22:38:51 It's a dangerous behemoth that will damage First Nations' air, land, water and fish stocks. It will harm the rest of us, too. It's not meant to be. Scrap it. Save the environment!
185 2018-09-05 22:38:45 I believe the store stocks up to 5x - that link should go straight to them!
186 2018-09-05 22:38:31 Probably care about ratings as much as Nike cares about their stocks dropping by millions over night.

188 2018-09-05 22:36:38 How can u buy pot stocks?
189 2018-09-05 22:36:35 Nike is one of the stocks in a Vanguard index fund I own 367 shares of. It's in an index fund. I dont buy individual stocks.
190 2018-09-05 22:36:27 Massively correct on the right stocks.
191 2018-09-05 22:35:54 In a month or so, the other companies will likely be back up as well. In the meantime, a few people snagged stocks for cheaper than they would otherwise get them. It is the nature of the investment business I suppose.
192 2018-09-05 22:35:54 How do I know when to buy a company’s stocks? 

When MAGAts are protesting them. 

Buy low sell high!
193 2018-09-05 22:34:41 i am calm as a clam. i can care less my buddy who holds mad amounts of $AMZN and btfd every chance he gets looks smarter than me short term. i understand the LONG game. he didn't even know stocks were in a bull market during the entire obama admin. #crypto #bitcoin $btc

195 2018-09-05 22:33:01 @Nike fuck your business that’s why the stocks are going down, dumbasses why would you promote Colin? He’s a idiot a disgrace to our country
196 2018-09-05 22:31:54 While they busy burning shoes I’ll get busy buying stocks
197 2018-09-05 22:31:29 Dreamy, everyone isn't supposed to get paid the same. The harder the job or the more responsibility involved in the job, the more money you get. Someone who stocks shelves should not make the same wage as someone who supervises 20 people.
198 2018-09-05 22:31:25 Not only is it time to buy Nike socks, it's time to buy Nike stocks. Win win for us left wing nut jobs!!!!!!! #socksandstocks
199 2018-09-05 22:31:13 He never mentioned stocks. Some people are angry and others are boycotting.
200 2018-09-05 22:30:39 Stocks are rocking!  I'm making 8.95% on my stocks!
201 2018-09-05 22:29:33 So has anyone bought some stocks with Nike yet?
202 2018-09-05 22:29:24 @Nike PAT TILLMAN sacrificed everything.I quit wearing your crap,over priced shoes years ago and aren’t Nike’s made in China?Gonna enjoy watching your stocks Tank 
203 2018-09-05 22:29:18 When the market is up but my stocks are down #Treason
204 2018-09-05 22:28:49 Elizabeth Warren's newly proposed bill on Wall Street is a bit too restrictive. Middle class families can invest in stocks too. She should run on that platform. She might lose to this guy. #Elizabethwarren #diehl
205 2018-09-05 22:27:30 Cutting socks but still holding on to stocks.
206 2018-09-05 22:27:23 Honestly, I don’t think it will affect it much either. I just don’t support their decision A) The slogan is dumb because he isn’t sacrificing anything since he’s making more money than if he were a backup QB B) as you mentioned stocks go up and down constantly.
207 2018-09-05 22:27:22 Great write-up, thanks for sharing.  I agree with the grind as support for the last few months.  And having spent some time looking at long term OTM calls in various leading stocks and the indices, my sense is others are loading up should we make the move higher.  Thanks again.
208 2018-09-05 22:27:00 Value or quality are so overrated mho. Check quality indices now, unless sector adjusted there are full of tech... same goes for value, not intrinsic characteristics but pure narrow screening, which results in oversold stocks and then you hope for momentum or high oil price.
209 2018-09-05 22:26:51 @Nike stocks are up
Puma down

212 2018-09-05 22:25:42 Hahahaha hirap pag ubos na stocks mo sa bahay 
213 2018-09-05 22:25:36 today was a bad day in Tech. There is no sugar coating. Usually when momo stocks selloff like this i take notice as it is rarely a one day thing. notice the VIX was barely green. it is the second or third day when the panic selling begins. i am hedging port with short /nq
214 2018-09-05 22:24:58 You sure about that? If there were stocks half of Trump's cabinet and campaign team would be in them right now.
215 2018-09-05 22:24:32 This ad campaign won’t have any effect on Nike. Stocks drop by 3% today only to go up 10% by the end of the month! Buy the dip!
216 2018-09-05 22:24:20 Nah but frfr what’s up with them stocks @Nike
217 2018-09-05 22:23:52 stocks and socks and 2018
218 2018-09-05 22:23:33 Actually Nike stocks are rising and the majority of people would rather kneel with @Kaepernick7 then ever stand with you, Making humanity aware of its flaws ie.racism by kneeling is more of an acknowledgement of the issues in this world then you have ever made
219 2018-09-05 22:23:28 And even if it did, Nike would just use the money they got from Trump’s tax cuts and buyback a bunch of stocks and wait for them to go up again.
220 2018-09-05 22:22:23 Stocks must be low.  Lol keep up fk work love seeing big Corps scrape bottom..
221 2018-09-05 22:21:04 U.S. stocks closed mixed Wednesday,09/05/18: $DJIA +0.09% (+22.5) at 25,974.99, $SPX -0.28% (-8.1) at 2,888.60, $COMPQ -1.19% (-96.0) at 7,995.17.
222 2018-09-05 22:20:52 They gained over 40 million dollars of press and not only that but adidas and puma stocks went down so they are doing fine
223 2018-09-05 22:20:39 How were your stocks at the end of W. Bush?
Thanks Obama!

232 2018-09-05 22:18:29 Nike stocks are up. Meanwhile,  dipshit and liar @realDonaldTrump says they are "getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts."
I know his followers have trouble with truth vs fiction, but the rest of us can fact check this bullshit.

Oh and Stocks the Video Game (#4) is fun lol
234 2018-09-05 22:17:23 Nice “business” move Nike when stocks are down.. BUT his message started 730 days ago? And I believe he  was on your payroll since 2011 !! Where were ya then??? I don’t have a problem with any person of any color or gender peacefully protesting on their OWN time! Smooth move Nike
235 2018-09-05 22:16:49 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS
236 2018-09-05 22:16:48 @Onyema_Donald Stocks or forex
237 2018-09-05 22:16:46 Huh? I didn't get slaughtered... didn't sell any U stocks today. I was on buy side of those transactions. There's a buyer for every seller. You only get slaughtered when you sell at a loss. Fundamentals stronger than ever for uranium bulls, imho. Spot price speaks for itself!
238 2018-09-05 22:16:38 Nike stocks are going up, and NFL ratings are down because players are committing suicide due to CTE and we’re not doing anything about it. Nothing you say about the flag will drastically plummet the NFL
239 2018-09-05 22:16:02 @jimcramer hey what’s the word on LBrands? And what’s going on with the defense stocks? Help!!!! #madtweets
240 2018-09-05 22:16:02  flushing sound...Nike stocks tank even lower

242 2018-09-05 22:15:18 Awesome! This is exactly the message @nikE needs to see. Pretty sure that the “dip” their stocks took, is just the beginning.

244 2018-09-05 22:15:07 Time to get some stocks
245 2018-09-05 22:14:51 Well, it’s part of doing business, but you gotta love futures cuz they also have a better tax rate than stocks 
246 2018-09-05 22:14:51 Google it Nike took a $4 billion hit yesterday in the stocks
247 2018-09-05 22:14:22 Nike stocks fucc around and go up holding down the black communities
248 2018-09-05 22:13:31 John. Appreciate your daily info in Uranium space.
Honesly not pretty sure the uranium stocks and prices wont fall with the US stock market crash that might happen very soon.
249 2018-09-05 22:12:54 Win/win for execs at Nike, if stocks go down we will buy them all up at lower price, 6 months America forgets all about this and life goes on and we are richer, goes up were richer, they aren't stupid
250 2018-09-05 22:12:18 Hey @Nike, how’s that kneeler working out for you?  Stocks shoot up?  Products flying off of the shelves?  Just wondered.
#BrandSuicide
251 2018-09-05 22:12:07 To be fair that's more 'research' than most people do on stocks right now.
252 2018-09-05 22:11:34 @MadMoneyOnCNBC have the Chinese tech stocks hit bottom? Baba jd huya momo Baidu etc
253 2018-09-05 22:11:33 Nike stock may be up FOR NOW....but with Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James leaving Nike, their stocks will plummet!!!  Bye bye Air Jordan’s!  #JustBlewIt #NikeSucks
254 2018-09-05 22:10:59 But just think of all the money that politicians made on their war stocks. Big money in bombing citizens.
255 2018-09-05 22:10:51 It’s almost like the boycott did nothing... oh wait because it did. Yesterday all the shoe/athletic merch type stocks were down a few percentage points
256 2018-09-05 22:09:52 I need to get in the habit of checking my stocks at least once a day smh
257 2018-09-05 22:09:51 @JunDishes Quick annoying question, I’m sure but do you get garlic bulbs, fresh herbs or stocks in the B.B. house? Ginger root or even bouillon cubes?
258 2018-09-05 22:09:43 What is the status of "BUMP STOCKS"?  We are slowly approaching the first anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre.  Has anything been done?
259 2018-09-05 22:09:32 That seems like an extreme stance but I dont support bans (except bump stocks). Not when there's a dozen other perfectly reasonable solutions we could try first that might help first. As a nation we're going to have to decide what an acceptable number is and work to that.
260 2018-09-05 22:09:27 nothing in video that says anything about cannabis stocks or tickers, fake news
261 2018-09-05 22:09:26 Lmao nike stocks fluctuated just like other businesses did. I'm 100% they calculated the risk & decided they didn't care abt losing a few crybabies. Especially since they're a global brand & they probably planned for this but go off lady.
262 2018-09-05 22:09:11 Lips bulging like the Rock in a crop top, my gum lines starting to look like Nike stocks.
263 2018-09-05 22:08:51 I hope everyone buys some Nike this week or something lmao bc if stocks just continue to go down smh nvm
264 2018-09-05 22:08:27 WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

•Killed Puerto Ricans
•Make US businesses go out of business or leave the country due to tariffs
•Allow corporations to buy back their stocks
•Emboldened racists to take their tiki torches to the street
•Play golf (regularly)
•Tweet about POC
•etc...
265 2018-09-05 22:08:24 And because the rich are less likely to need to sell their stocks, their disproportionate ownership exacerbates limited stock float (beyond the impact of share buybacks, fewer public companies, etc.) further increasing valuations.
266 2018-09-05 22:08:14 キタわね...
267 2018-09-05 22:07:50 I’ll buy ONLY Nike now...even when they’re not on sale! And let’s be clear, Nike’s stock performed as well as most stocks in this past week! Ups and downs! Chill out with the fake news!! Nike knows who REALLY supports them, trust!
268 2018-09-05 22:07:26 All the stocks that needed some adjustments got them right from the get go.  $SQ, $MSFt, $AMZN, $PYPL, $MA, etc.  U name it.  They all got some adjustments.
269 2018-09-05 22:07:22 I think the majority of individual stocks are just too high/overvalued right now. That said, I tend to think companies getting involved too heavy into political/social issues doesn’t move their needle from a sales standpoint. (1/2)
270 2018-09-05 22:07:12 Amazon stock goes up & Bezzos becomes richer The solution is? he must sell some stock to keep his wealth below some limit? Stocks go up and down, how will that work? Stock is not $ in the bank. Would u limit this to just $, or maybe just tax income. FYI Amazon pays no dividends.
271 2018-09-05 22:07:10 Maybe they’ll get Kaepernick to be their poster child. Let’s see how their stocks do.
272 2018-09-05 22:06:53 Why do we use markets to determine the values of individual stocks? Should the government do this instead?
273 2018-09-05 22:06:08 EZ shares -1.3%, US shares -0.3% as EM rout continues (EM shares -1.8% and down 19.7% from Jan high) and tech stocks under pressure (Nasdaq -1.2%).
US 10 yr yld flat at 2.9%.
Oil -1.6%, gold +0.4%, iron ore +0.3%.
ASX futures -0.4%.
$A 0.7192 as $US index -0.2%.
274 2018-09-05 22:05:44 Stocks sell off much faster than they go up in general, so if you are heavily exposed it can be tough to sit. This is why we constantly harp on only entering a stock where risk can be managed "optimally."
275 2018-09-05 22:05:34 i see a new market the next they are F...up after stocks
276 2018-09-05 22:05:25 It was the one gamble that paid off .... Nike stocks up 0.5% in pre trading today with a total gain of 43 at the close of the market...
277 2018-09-05 22:05:10 Look for more layoffs as stocks go down
278 2018-09-05 22:04:39 Win Nov canola down A$1.15/t & EU rape down A$0.32. Expectations of large Canadian canola stocks on hand keeping pressure on market. Rains have been causing harvest delays & potentially some damage in Canada. Nervousness in oilseeds re the US/China trade war.
279 2018-09-05 22:04:39 You are getting fake news, our country is in the best shape its ever been in. The economy, jobs and unemployment, stocks, Roths 401ks consumer confidence everything is setting records like no one has ever seen... ever.
280 2018-09-05 22:04:21 My go-to thought is ‘what is he trying to distract us from?’ What is happening behind the scenes? What stocks has he just purchased and what markets is he trying to manipulate?  Who does he need to take power from to further gain wealth, privilege, and power?
281 2018-09-05 22:04:15 With all this controversy around Nike and Colin Kaepernick it might be a good time to look into buying some nike stocks
282 2018-09-05 22:04:06 Their stocks took a knee
283 2018-09-05 22:04:01 I just bought a couple of stocks and I’m excited to see what they go up too! 
284 2018-09-05 22:03:22 i see a new market the next they are F...up after stocks
285 2018-09-05 22:02:29 @CitronResearch I don't know how this idiot gets away with manipulating stocks ! SEC should seriously look into this company. Shorts companies makes money then covers. He did the same thing with SQ ! And look at where SQ is trading at. He manipulates the stocks for his OWN GAIN!
286 2018-09-05 22:02:27 Not Apple products. Apple stocks. As per investment in Apple inc.
287 2018-09-05 22:02:21 comment jaimerais trop avoir une army bomb ver 3 pour le concert, comme ca elle change de couleur et tout mais LE PRIX et les STOCKS mdrrr impossible
288 2018-09-05 22:01:53 Yes, of course I wasn’t expecting actual advice.
I’d be interested to know how people are running their portfolios though. 
Risks seem everywhere, including as Dr Hunt says not being long a lot of stocks in the upswing.
289 2018-09-05 22:01:20 Complete fabrication. Point republicans have never moved quickly in any administration to say the success is completed besides Trump? Please Reps and Dems never get anything done. Anonymous. Total hit piece from the desperate NYT.
290 2018-09-05 22:01:15 Hmm ironic for two reason: you didn’t even respect a war vet when he was alive, or even after he passed away, and Nike’s stocks have not suffered as dramatic as you say and will increase in the coming weeks and months. Funny how people call liberals “snowflakes”....

292 2018-09-05 22:00:58 Should have at least visited my points though - I suspect I’m less biased than you. Shame. When the stocks are gone you won’t be able to help the fishermen either, but sobeit.
293 2018-09-05 22:00:14 Yes... AMD and weed stocks lol... Although, I just opened a CRON short... 
294 2018-09-05 21:59:11 YES, I got the credit part in order. Working on stocks and investments currently
295 2018-09-05 21:58:37 i guess pot stocks are the next thing... exit crypto, enter maryjane.
296 2018-09-05 21:58:32 No driving(no gas profits) no work 24hrs(sales slump) and sell off coal/oil/gas stocks. Could make'em listen?
297 2018-09-05 21:58:32 @gilbertbrisbois Gilbert les stocks de vieux tshirts de l’after je donnerais tout pour en avoir un et pouvoir le partager avec mon équipe de foot!
298 2018-09-05 21:58:15 time to go invest into nike stocks
299 2018-09-05 21:58:03 is a skill in itself. Do you use a rolling stop, do you use a % stop from peaks, technical stops behind previous s&r levels, signif numerically etc etc. It’s a subject I’ve struggled with, so instead I’ve gradually shifted towards selecting high quality LT stocks & buying on dips
300 2018-09-05 21:58:01 One of my favourite recent trades was with the stocks PKX, gave me a 198% ROI also RDS.B 106%, REGI 138%, RYAM 260% and SHI 106%, all great ROI's took awhile but was worth it.
301 2018-09-05 21:57:24 Win Nov canola down A$1.15/t & EU rape down A$0.32. Expectations of large Canadian canola stocks on hand keeping pressure on market. Rains have been causing harvest delays & potentially some damage in Canada. Nervousness in oilseeds re the US/China trade war.
302 2018-09-05 21:56:52 @TheStalwart chart in tomorrow's newsletter comparing biggest pot stocks vs coins?
303 2018-09-05 21:56:36 Growth stocks getting hit today. They were stretched and they need to pull back in order to set us up for another leg higher. There's nothing more to it.
304 2018-09-05 21:55:40 Lmao the word of the day is stocks. Be smart
305 2018-09-05 21:55:02 @realDonaldTrump nice thatyou realistwork on the u.s, inner econemi ,unreal you can profide a social structure stablisiation(medicine  pension/homeles ,slum ..  etc) without a stabel inner econemi ,the U.s are overattet on the stocks since  /alongtime ,
306 2018-09-05 21:54:57 Keep being mad at NIKE I need them stocks to drop a lilllllll bit more!!!
307 2018-09-05 21:54:32 So I was out all day and now have to listen to all of Dorsey’s testimony to even have a clue what $TWTR/nasdaq affect not to mention reading up on the weed stocks...if you want to trade for a living you MUST be attuned to the “din” of the market. Everyday 
308 2018-09-05 21:54:19 Nike stocks, DOWN 3.16% today; that is a HUGE drop.

I wonder, why?
309 2018-09-05 21:52:53 Dude. The average human being doesn't concern themselves with highs/lows of stocks. It might as well be advanced calculus
310 2018-09-05 21:52:52 People think that Nike is losing money now but they're not. Their stocks are up 40%. Don't talk shit if you don't know what the fuck is actually going on.
311 2018-09-05 21:52:34 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
312 2018-09-05 21:51:15 Try going full screen on Stocks. Huge white bands on the sides. Kind of like DF I guess, but Apple has far more resources and should be able to design more adaptable layouts than you can working alone.
313 2018-09-05 21:51:01 They all shorted stocks and want Trump to fail so the market falls and they can make a boatload of money just like Soros did.
314 2018-09-05 21:49:58 Thanks for the warning OS. Thats why some put options after stocks breaking the key levels!
315 2018-09-05 21:49:46 And no one keeps large stocks of this stuff anywhere - it’s a refrigerated JIT supply chain across EU28.  With no deal airfreight of medicine won’t be possible either as we lose our flight rights to EU skies.
316 2018-09-05 21:49:27 You clearly haven't checked stocks today. Or know how markets work. Or even understand how large companies stocks work.
317 2018-09-05 21:48:56 Still find it harder to buy stocks when they are red , but I have been adding...
318 2018-09-05 21:48:22 Think imma buy some Nike stocks.
319 2018-09-05 21:47:43 A fund manager buying .30 cent stocks
320 2018-09-05 21:47:35 Wonder, how them? Stocks doing??
321 2018-09-05 21:47:00 You’re the expert you tell me, but something is very wrong. Font much too heavy and too closely spaced compared to any other Mac app. E.g. Stocks uses bold for everything, but bold is normally rare on Mac. Even things like system pref pane names aren’t bold.
322 2018-09-05 21:46:40 There's really much less worry being short biased because there's always some kind of fraudulent scam going on with these stocks and people stealing the money and dumping hidden shares. It's almost a guaranteed win unless there's a temporary squeeze
323 2018-09-05 21:46:21 I wish you good luck with this, yet I think the signs are on the wall that there will be a meltdown in oil stocks.
324 2018-09-05 21:46:17 I do understand if you look at the big picture that’s all this is Nike doesn’t care about anything but it’s investors and stocks
325 2018-09-05 21:45:52 U.S. stocks closed mixed Wednesday,09/05/18: $DJIA +0.09% at 25,974.99, $SPX -0.28% at 2,888.60, $COMPQ -1.19% at 7,995.17, $RUT -0.33% at $1727.65.
326 2018-09-05 21:45:48 Lmfao nah it’s dead legit I made some money off it but need more money and education to get more out of it. Look the app up there are better sites to invest with but they take commission and for a beginner you may just wanna start w stocks only which the app is good for.
327 2018-09-05 21:45:05 At least we know the real reason pot stocks flew today...
328 2018-09-05 21:44:39 Oof trading accounts -2.5% today. Damn tech growth stocks
329 2018-09-05 21:44:03 Dabbing in stocks now
330 2018-09-05 21:43:29 I thought the email was fantastic. I’m waiting to know what to do though? Do I go stocks to 0pct or 10pct? Do I just stay in cash and lose to inflation or trust twitter and lose more money in gold? Not rhetorical question- genuine advice request.
331 2018-09-05 21:43:14 Ellen Pompeo the industrial machinery mechanic is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is betrayed by Ryan Cabrera.
332 2018-09-05 21:42:55 Beto plead guilty to violating the STCK (STOCK) Act, which prohibits members of  Congress from profiting in the (IPO) of company stocks that government is  approving. Used insider info to purchase 7 stocks, seeing a 39% gain. Was not in his 20's then.
333 2018-09-05 21:42:16 Twitter promoted both Nike & NYT’s today. Tell me again there’s no bias Jack. These types are money grubbers, the only way they learn is when their stocks drop.
334 2018-09-05 21:41:20 Markets ended red after uncertainty of trade war eruption  #Stocks #Markets #Trading #Investor #TradeWar #Nike
335 2018-09-05 21:40:59 Stocks move wildly purely on speculation. Just because @Nike stock took a hit today, don't back down, it's not over. The drop was a knee jerk reaction and likely climb again. Keep hitting their bottom line. Compare earnings reports to gauge effectiveness.

336 2018-09-05 21:40:53 Fallait vider les stocks xD

339 2018-09-05 21:40:03 so we do buy pot stocks then?
340 2018-09-05 21:39:45 Yeah. A few thousand. What would you call it? Stocks are up from what they closed at yesterday. Tantrum not working? Try stomping your feet harder and crying louder.
341 2018-09-05 21:39:45 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
342 2018-09-05 21:39:40 looking at the stocks today Nike has gone up. looks like you dont know what your talking about... Again
343 2018-09-05 21:39:21 Mine is a mix of vested stocks, savings, and friends who are supportive by picking up the tab most of the time.
344 2018-09-05 21:39:11 of the Year on top of all that. Shit, Who would not fire Amber Stocks who was coach and GM for the Sky.
345 2018-09-05 21:38:37 These are also the only opportunities for smash news to come up. It’s like if your store stocks up now&then, & you hope everytime that it brings in your favorite candy because that’s the only time you’ll have a chance to get it. If they don’t deliver that candy, you’d be mad lol
346 2018-09-05 21:38:00 Beto Plead guilty to violating the STCK (STOCK) Act, which prohibits members of  Congress from profiting in the (IPO) of company stocks that government is approving. Used inside info to purchase 7 stocks, seeing a 39% gain. Once a crook in office likely to be again.
347 2018-09-05 21:37:58 Smart move by Nike. With all his problems the President will give them free headlines everytime he has his little rallies. If all his detractors by Nike products their stocks should shoot up.
348 2018-09-05 21:36:36 You’re tweeting a lot today. Too much caffeine? Too few cheap stocks?
349 2018-09-05 21:36:26 HAL & RTN stocks are down, good time to jump in, if that’s your thing. But FRG stock is doing fine w help from AL & Murkowski.
350 2018-09-05 21:36:01 Let me tell u minorities something...  yes they hate trump just like u, they even agree he’s unethical n might even be racist..... but they do like how their stocks n 401K are looking... just giving y’all a heads up, 2020 might surprise y’all again
351 2018-09-05 21:35:17 I downloaded Robinhood. The advise given to me is, invest in things you actually purchase. I have Nike, Apple, gold, and a few gas and oil company stocks. Get the ones with high dividends, you get money back from it. I haven’t bought a stock in two years and still earned $500

361 2018-09-05 21:31:39 I personally think the so-called #Retail Apocalypse is/was more about Wall St. valuation & what they think investors will pay for retail company stocks... as opposed to how the actual retail businesses perform...

367 2018-09-05 21:27:57 Not if that means dredging everything up as it looked like some Brixham boats were doing - we need to protect the stocks (and the environment for God’s sake) regardless of ‘country’.  I’m not with you and I’m British through and through.
368 2018-09-05 21:27:35 I been watchin stocks all day, Nike not going no where. No real drop #FakeNews
369 2018-09-05 21:27:11 Gonna be Nike’s slogan after their stocks tank.

What do I have to do with Stocks going up?
It is rich people game not mine.
Federal Wage is still $7.25 per hour.  And Trump says it should stay there because it is good for employers. That is my concern not Stock Market.
380 2018-09-05 21:24:51 Sooner or later, there will be a rotation from US stocks to US LT treasury bonds, when people realize that all US assets are not pristine. I just wanted to point out the other factor (global currency movement) to highlight various crosscurrents in play.
381 2018-09-05 21:24:50 Lol why do you say not to long Canadian stocks. I’m interested in the humor
382 2018-09-05 21:24:40 Good job, we all know it’s just a meeting to keep an eye on his oil stocks.
383 2018-09-05 21:24:38 A second round pick for Howard is nothing when Howard is an All-Star. Sky did the exact dumb shit with EDD for Dolson and some no name player.

386 2018-09-05 21:22:55 In other words, if rupee and other emerging market currencies continue to fall, that may give boost to US stocks.

396 2018-09-05 21:16:53 Stocks are climbing back up for them now. Womp Womp.
397 2018-09-05 21:16:50 Their stocks are waaay up? Hmmmm doesn’t seem like they are getting “absolutely killed”
398 2018-09-05 21:16:12 Well, Turkey stocks just plummeted. No one wants the tryptophan. If they fall asleep, they'll miss something great. Might I suggest Thanksgiving ham!?
399 2018-09-05 21:16:08 1999-2000 was utterly insane. I recall many tech employees had exercised stock options and come tax time their stocks were down 80% or so.

407 2018-09-05 21:09:58 The count wouldn't change materially, because then the bigger wave 2 bottom would be followed by wave 1 of big wave 3. I don't terminate anything, I'll hold until the Dow/Gold Ratio has returned to a low congruent with a secular bottom (1 or below) at which point I'll buy stocks.
408 2018-09-05 21:09:51 Should've said that 10 years ago. Some real sh*t. T.O. & Ocho a still be in the league. The NFL's a stock investment, just like all the other stocks. When players come together, they move off of players movements. Too many hold out for money, they get bigger contracts like @OBJ_3

410 2018-09-05 21:09:24 Nike will lose a lot trust me. Just follow their stocks. 3 months ago their stock was $82.20 now $79.98 next month will be lower.
411 2018-09-05 21:09:10 I mean no offense but I'm not sure you understand how the stock market works. companies are *not* independent. when ALL shoe stocks drop, you can't say Nike decline is about CK. when Nike was only one to rebound today, it's more evidence that he isn't drag on stock at this point.
412 2018-09-05 21:08:59 I think Crocs stocks are probably through the roof rn.
413 2018-09-05 21:08:39 Your dad Grand Dad would smile about this news though Michael Jordan just resigned from Nike.
Labron Kames just quit Nike.
& The CEO OF NIKE JUST QUIT. So there ya go. 
Oh & Nike just lost a ton more in money & stocks today.
414 2018-09-05 21:08:34 Interesting coverage on @CNBC today about The Social Smackdown! #socialmedia #stocks #theyaredown
415 2018-09-05 21:08:14 
416 2018-09-05 21:07:33 No they both will crash and burn. Stop trying to pump these stocks when you have a short position already.
417 2018-09-05 21:06:59 I wouldn't mind if tRump got put in the stocks and got paddled with a Forbes magazine for a few days straight.
418 2018-09-05 21:06:54 And Adidas... Under Armour.... most other consumer stocks. But facts never help a MAGAts argument
419 2018-09-05 21:06:35 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close lower led by Tech declines amid escalating trade concerns.
420 2018-09-05 21:06:24 Buying stocks!
421 2018-09-05 21:06:17 Yes yes....very inspiring. But ASICS makes better shoes and they stay out of politics. So I’ll buy ASICS and just do it, only better and without the BS. Enjoy your tanking stocks!
422 2018-09-05 21:06:03 @GuyAdami @petenajarian Like I said this really doesn’t deserve the air time it’s getting social media. It is what it is. There’s better stories to talk about like AMD and many other stocks in my opinion. What a buying opportunity for the market because of noise imo Pete and guy
423 2018-09-05 21:05:06 $NBEV a huge move end of the day. Might be a nice play tomorrow following all these MJ stocks. $TLRY $CRON $CGC

426 2018-09-05 21:04:58 Sweat shop stocks are rising.
427 2018-09-05 21:04:51 Not saying kneeling is right or wrong but Nike is doing this for money/ attention. If they actually cared about what’s right they wouldn’t be paying people 20 cents an hour to make a shoe that makes Nike a ridiculous profit. Kind of backfired considering the stocks down 4%
428 2018-09-05 21:04:47 Time to invest in Nike Stocks!

432 2018-09-05 21:04:19 Nike like so many other billionaires are liberal. They’re going to make their point everything else be damned. Profits, customers, reputations doesn’t matter. We’ve seen this repeatedly. Kathy Grif.,snoop, emenim, Kap.etc.. Nike made its pt. even if it costs them  at Stocks!

435 2018-09-05 21:03:47 I can’t trade with American options in Spain , very limited here to trade in USA . Just stocks and some warrants .
436 2018-09-05 21:03:40 This is one of the worst stocks to invest in.  PB and Marc definitely took investors for a ride.

457 2018-09-05 20:59:05 If you got money, tap into Nike Stocks.
458 2018-09-05 20:58:52 Their stocks aren’t getting killed. Trumper buys cheap $80-100 Nikes. Kaepernick fans and Athletes buy $300-400 Nikes. That’s 3-4 Trumpers needed to cancel out one supporter ( whom has come out in numbers to buy more Air Jordan’s) looks like you just gave them hype is all.
459 2018-09-05 20:58:21 I honestly can’t wait til I start learning and investing in stocks.
460 2018-09-05 20:58:03 #Nike did exactly what their message conveys. They sacrificed losing customers  and stocks for the bigger picture. #JustDoIt 
461 2018-09-05 20:57:23 Woh, lots of red today stocks and coins. Wonder if there's something we're missing..

463 2018-09-05 20:56:46 #ars has a legion of followers (including me!) and for very good reason. #hzm still going slightly under the radar in my opinion. Both are quality stocks that I strongly believe will be trading significantly higher come year end with the incoming BFS. Conviction needed!
464 2018-09-05 20:56:27 Je trouve ca tellement dommage que BigHit n'arrive pas à suivre la demande ! Les lightsticks sont tjr sold out et ils ont bien précisé que les stocks pour les concerts seront très limités (autant dire pas plus d'une centaine ^^) J'aimerai bcp en acheter un mais c'est mission imp
465 2018-09-05 20:56:27 So capital investment is the platform like the stock market. You buy stock with your own money & watch it grow. I’ve had mine since I was a kid so I can trade & buy new stocks if I want. From the money that I’ve earned in all my other stocks i had extra $ to buy the Nike one.
466 2018-09-05 20:55:39 All sports apparel stocks slumped a bit yesterday.
467 2018-09-05 20:55:30 does twitter not know how stocks work? 3B off of an 128B company is nothing...and i bet nike’s stock will skyrocket in the next quarter because it now has HEAVY black support bc of kap and the anti-blm’s will give up soon enough bc they’re literally mad for no reason.

475 2018-09-05 20:53:23 just do it! Stocks plummetinggg. BIGGEST blunder since ‘NEW COKE’. Lol I will never purchase another @Nike product again, and will throw all #nike products I own in trash. Thank you. I don’t have to feel guilty anymore about buying your shoes made for 15 cents in a sweat shop
476 2018-09-05 20:52:36 $GT, $CNP, $HSIC, $SJM, $DLTR, $ESRX and $OI were the top performing $SPX #stocks today, all closing up over 3% #trading
477 2018-09-05 20:52:18 @wizards_magic really disappointed about the lack of interest in releasing #MTGGRN mythic booster boxes outside of the US. I guess as long as all stocks sell out it doesn't matter whether its scalpers or honest gamers :(
478 2018-09-05 20:51:06 Oh my god. Yeah, just-- being able to look up their base info (excluding stocks / consulting/etc) makes me think we need a cap on those salaries bc who STARTS at 450k/year???
479 2018-09-05 20:51:04 No, just a big hit on my stocks and swing positions.    :(
480 2018-09-05 20:50:23 I reckon ORE and GXY might be good after yesterday’s puke. Happy to share ideas on stocks in play! :)
481 2018-09-05 20:50:02 @MebFaber Do you ever invest in individual stocks for fun?  ...but also to beat the average.

484 2018-09-05 20:49:48 Do we normally draw national crude oil stocks this time of year?
485 2018-09-05 20:49:37 I dunno. Those are pretty important things for me. I liked tinkering with weapon stocks, barrels, grips etc. Having fully customised weapons in previous games in the franchise, only to remove that, seems like a big step backwards.
486 2018-09-05 20:49:35 Just download a trading platform like “e-trade” or “td-ameritrade” and make an account and funnd your account through your bank account and purchase the nike stocks
487 2018-09-05 20:48:52 Well you would know all about stocks going down, right Keith?

489 2018-09-05 20:48:37 Yea, they may have lost investement from stocks, but this whole thing is for them to sell more product, which will then increase market value increasing stock prices
490 2018-09-05 20:48:08 I think I’m gonna buy some stocks in Nike right now
491 2018-09-05 20:47:26 It's still a bull market, but in a distribution phase.  That's why you have these deep pullbacks in these certain stocks compared to the index.  I'll be swinging less and daytrading more... The volatility is great for daytrades
492 2018-09-05 20:47:19 @1paidton what the Mj stocks looking like now ?
493 2018-09-05 20:46:58 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your fibromyalgia

495 2018-09-05 20:46:00 The tweet which no one will read, but I need to make it: I’m 25 yo IT guy with CS background and 3 yrs BO and MO exp in IBD looking for increasing my finance competency and increasing my market knowledge. This acc will be about my journey into deep jungle of stocks
496 2018-09-05 20:45:36 No Problem! It's a little backwards how measure it.

I'm defining Portfolio Orders as Volume which shows up across all the stocks in the NYSE and at times/levels where a projection of volume momentum is not extreme. 

Market Wide & Focused on How the Exchange will Close.
497 2018-09-05 20:45:19 So than al the pot stocks are day/swing trades and there is no long term outlook?
498 2018-09-05 20:45:10 Dam Trump you gonna say all that but Nike is one of your biggest stocks you have  .... along with Apple & Microsoft

@Nike cares less about what we think! They caved with the left! No backbone..the CEO of Nike knows we the middle class are any use for them..

They have the RADICAL LEFT behind them!

502 2018-09-05 20:44:04 Silly is talking about these guys like stocks when there is a human element and a win now element to consider. The Jets have a certain way of running their organization. 

This wasnt a good or bad choice, it was the only choice for them.
503 2018-09-05 20:43:29 Should I market buy all the pot stocks tomm?
504 2018-09-05 20:43:08 $ZUO ER did great as well, and look what happened to it... Still going down. Looks like a good buy at this price

Tech stocks got hit hard for a very dumb reason
505 2018-09-05 20:42:40 Stocks are up
506 2018-09-05 20:42:28 Nike stock is up because some Rich ass person did some buying which than led to others jumping on the band wagon! Than once stocks went up the Rich ass sold their shares. It’s really easy to figure out Kellyann.
507 2018-09-05 20:41:34 2/ Air-pockets notwithstanding, stocks will continue to have the support of the credit market / buybacks, so no "credits" rolling on the movie that's been playing for the last 9 years.

513 2018-09-05 20:39:37 Yup - that's what I do - I let my stocks tell me to buy/sell/hold/trim/add etc.

Thanks for your advice.
514 2018-09-05 20:39:36 It's interesting to note, though, that numerous government agencies failed to act on this kid that could have prevented this. Yet, the clarion call is "more government"..amazing...

517 2018-09-05 20:37:44 Stocks just went up, AMAZING.
518 2018-09-05 20:37:36 It’s hard because the bots/monitor groups always catch these stocks first. And I think these shoes are highly limited like the first edition, they only had 200 pairs for the first edition.

527 2018-09-05 20:34:36 Let me also say two things for the #maga hedge fund managers ( )

A. Stocks fluctuate greatly day-to-day

B. Nike stock went up today (for those citing yesterday’s drop)

C. I’ve heard all your insults before, & it’s not intimidating
528 2018-09-05 20:34:19 And their stocks are up Hannity
529 2018-09-05 20:33:17 Sorry to hear about your stocks, @2ndamendmentfan14 is ruthless 
530 2018-09-05 20:31:48 Cutting tax push $ into market, cutting welfare take $ away from market. If the market goes up for tax cut, the welfare cut will put the market back to where it started. I was surprised market struggled in 2018. I thought 2018 should be a safe year for stocks.

532 2018-09-05 20:30:59 Lol bro I’m jus saying if you don’t have racks then you ain’t gon profit much from Nike. It’s $80 a pop. Then you gotta let that investment just sit. Lotta folks ain’t got that kinda dough to be talkin Nike stocks right now we got bigger fish to fry lol.
533 2018-09-05 20:30:56 @KayaJones First Nike's and Now Levi's. I wonder if Levi Strauss stocks will drop.
534 2018-09-05 20:30:29 The combos don't really last that long so it's whatever and I don't think someone should be care much about losing stocks in friendlies unless you're on a rotation which is a completely different ballpark
535 2018-09-05 20:30:19 What is singled out. Age 21, just bump stocks that converts the rifle to an AR. BGC at flea markets, gun shows & all gun sales outlets, & AR notice these sensible rules do not take away the right to bear arms.
536 2018-09-05 20:30:18 Nike stocks are up with all the support they are getting LIAR. I really dont care if you find it hard to watch the NFL, you probably dont understand how the game is played to begin with, 5th grader.
537 2018-09-05 20:30:11 I am thinking of getting into penny stocks, but concerned the market is going to crash later this year. Are my  fears unfounded?
538 2018-09-05 20:29:36 Love how @Nike stocks are dropping faster then America hating Kapernick can drop to a knee.
539 2018-09-05 20:29:14 Nike stock ended up today.  Addidas, Puma, and Under Armour stocks all ended down today.
540 2018-09-05 20:28:59 Currently using just stash and trying out Robin hood, but I have to choose the ETFs or stocks that I'm interested in. You say Wealthfront does the investing for you?
541 2018-09-05 20:28:44 No one has asked me to do anything nor would I do someone else’s work.

My opinion is that you have an agenda and bias towards people & certain stocks and I don’t agree with this.

Best thing - let stock do the talking if you really don’t have a bias/agenda

Good luck

546 2018-09-05 20:27:40 May be so. But Shanghai is down ~20% from the highs (most Chinese growth stocks are down more than that), while the S&P/Nasdaq are rallying.
I actually dipped my toe into Argentina last week. Valuations are just absurd.

FX & bond markets were whipsawed by headlines saying Germany  dropped key Brexit demands (later denied). Emerging market currencies stable.
679 2018-09-05 19:44:03 Too bad this stock have no volume in state  cheap stock to own good Mj stocks   good managements
680 2018-09-05 19:43:45 apple stocks rise by 30%.
681 2018-09-05 19:43:17 So are hundreds of stocks who had nothing to do with controversial ads lol, it's a blip on their radar, that company is global, a few angry rednecks won't hurt em.
682 2018-09-05 19:42:19 Pot stocks are in the red today, almost all except for the $tlry madness
683 2018-09-05 19:42:09 #TrumpPuppet stop lying, people aren't better off. Companies are better off but they are using their tax breaks to buy stick back driving stocks up and enriching themselves.

685 2018-09-05 19:41:41 $vhc is easily one of the most manipulative stocks I’ve ever seen unbelievable (dark pools chat rooms etc. controls, anytime it pops it gets shorted big time)
686 2018-09-05 19:41:36 Meaningless statistics, if you know anything about stocks or NIKE.

689 2018-09-05 19:40:51 From a corporate finance perspective it would be malpractice if the pot stocks didn’t do massive secondary offerings up here

692 2018-09-05 19:39:36 Pathetic that you support division through Kaeperdick.  I’ll enjoy watching your stocks plummet
693 2018-09-05 19:39:23 ..i just looked 1 hour to all 40 marijuana tickers i follow and i noticed that just about 5 stocks are up the last 6 months.biggest is canopy off course.. but others not meaningfull....strange that just 1 is big up..and the rest are going up and down or some are falling
694 2018-09-05 19:39:20 Actually Nike lost 3.5 billion dollars in stocks due to this.
695 2018-09-05 19:39:05 Delighted to be alongside some awesome brands especially @babipur who now stocks #BeeBeeWraps 
696 2018-09-05 19:38:42 yep stupid... buy the things and then burn them. and trump probably bought stocks in the company

700 2018-09-05 19:36:48 wow this might actually be the stupidest thing you’ve ever said
701 2018-09-05 19:35:49 Mass-incarceration is wrong by All. B but no one wants to end their stocks!
702 2018-09-05 19:35:34 There are some UGLY moves in momentum stocks here,  Or not so ugly depending on one's view.  Money flowing into value, defensives
703 2018-09-05 19:34:37 tech stocks...doing bad
704 2018-09-05 19:33:56 Try Jam Jam, in Harare. Cynthia Bizure Sithole keeps stocks of trendy fashion. You can check on her Facebook, or DM and I can give you her contact.

- don’t let money sit there: learn how to invest it 

-do not invest in any stocks if the projected return is not greater that 6% ( you can get a return from a government bond w/o risk and get a 6% return)
706 2018-09-05 19:33:22 You certainly can get 8-10% without taking on much risk.  Canadian banks alone will give you that. Take on a little risk and you should easily beat that. Personally I'd stay in stocks directly and not Mutual funds or ETFs but to each their own.
707 2018-09-05 19:33:22 Fully agreed. A lot of the first rising stocks are needing or already in corrective phases. This is all healthy and constructive to build the next base to climb from.
708 2018-09-05 19:32:54 gonna drop 1000$ into Nike Stocks
709 2018-09-05 19:32:36 Stocks go up and down... so do sales.  Just ask the NFL.
710 2018-09-05 19:32:15 Economy is doing well. It's been a 10 yr trend. Trump corporate tax cuts added gasoline. Stock buybacks and foreign investment have stocks up. Issue is when bill comes due as trump spent future money now. Trump creating massive debts. Individual families still struggling
711 2018-09-05 19:32:07 @GregMannarino Is it crazy to believe that Trump, mueller,Comey,CNN,CNBC, etc are all on the same team & this has dragged on to create uncertainty &then nothing will materialize &trump looks like the hero going into nov earn/Xmas to nasdaq 9000 and even higher amzn,AAPL stocks
712 2018-09-05 19:32:04 Your guys in the incubator are fine. 20 and 35 degrees C are about the same to them. My stock at -80, though, are not amused. I’ll probably need to regrow them all and make fresh freezer stocks. A lot of work.
713 2018-09-05 19:31:36 Need nike stocks asap they just literaly dropped a all black commercial #JustDoIt
714 2018-09-05 19:31:00 A lot of my friends are saying to watch out for the Nike Stocks...  #watchthethrone
715 2018-09-05 19:30:32 As when anything slight controversial happens, stocks immediately dropped but what did they do the very next day?? Start moving back up.
716 2018-09-05 19:30:20 Work for big weed get some stocks baby!
717 2018-09-05 19:30:12 Agree but not yet . When trade war over there a HUGE opportunities in many Chinese stocks $BILI $HUYA $IQ $SOGO $JD $YY $SINA $WUBA $BZUN etc ....
718 2018-09-05 19:29:32 Stocks always rebound. Who knew a black man would be able to make you fragile white males transparent? Keep hating.
719 2018-09-05 19:29:28 4 stocks are responsible
720 2018-09-05 19:29:11 Just invested in Nike stocks. The time is now!

726 2018-09-05 19:27:21 Who stocks it??
727 2018-09-05 19:27:16 Anyone got Nike stocks!?!? Soon you’ll be able to use them instead of toilet paper
728 2018-09-05 19:26:58 People can burn $nke shoes or not buy their products anymore, but affecting the stock price hahaha!! Good stocks dont move off emotion only numbers the last time I checked $nke is winning.
729 2018-09-05 19:26:40 Adidas and Pumas stocks fell too along with Nike. Same amount of points too. So wtf is your point? I don’t see Kap anywhere on their pages???

731 2018-09-05 19:26:27 For decades, #EmergingMarkets equities were a leveraged play on developed economies. This stopped in 2012. That’s when correlations between the MSCI Emerging Markets Index $EEM & the S&P 500 began to break down. They’ve been spiky ever since, signaling a new phase for EM stocks.
732 2018-09-05 19:25:58 Prices do matter, and higher prices = lower expected returns. Prices for US Large Cap growth stocks (driven by FAANGs) are relatively high, but lower for small/value/int’l stocks. 

Lesson: diversify
733 2018-09-05 19:25:52 How much is @Nike stocks?
734 2018-09-05 19:25:48 Many stocks hitting the skids
735 2018-09-05 19:25:27 I can buy that. Just not something that works for me. I can't pick stocks so I don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to pick seth klarman...I'll be honest.
736 2018-09-05 19:24:14 I think that with a Samsung, it's easier to walk into a store and buy one on the first day, so you can touch it before you buy it. With Apple, you have to assume that they're sold out everywhere because they purposely have short stocks of the devices.
737 2018-09-05 19:24:03 No evidence from what I’ve seen - you say things to provoke and fuel the agenda e.g. people have had accounts closed etc when that’s a total lie. 

I don’t think you should focus on others because it’s clearly not working and need to focus on your own stocks.

748 2018-09-05 19:20:37 Couldn’t you/didn’t you say the same thing abt US stocks 3-5-7 years ago?

You’re comparing Japan at the very peak (P/E of 70) with US today (25)? Average US P/E since 1992 = 24.5 & S&P 500 = +9.8% annualized from 1992-8/2018

753 2018-09-05 19:19:38 A wash out in US stocks can only happen if we fall into a window of vulnerability (recession scare), which would go hand in hand with reversing FED stance (and credibility), causing USD declines and a soaring gold price. Am I missing something or are you guys changing course?
754 2018-09-05 19:19:02 Better Invest in some Nike or other stocks today then lol 
755 2018-09-05 19:18:56 this is the genuine joy of twtr. I am thinking I'm too bearish on US. It's going gangbusters as you say & we might see explosive euphoria into US stocks into y/end. And hawkishness from Powell. So EMFX has a lot more downside to go.
756 2018-09-05 19:17:26 Portfolio about to go green after being off almost 200 bps at one point today.. multiple stocks with huge drops but looking to finish strong

758 2018-09-05 19:15:44 Very very tiny % of people who listen to James Woods invest at all, own individual stocks, own Nike stocks or have the capability to sell so quickly that it pops up by 10 am on the opening.  That's not what happened.
759 2018-09-05 19:15:24 Looks straight from a '90s casting call for mallrats, pot stocks, eh not so much. Some boomers need to up their stereotype game.

777 2018-09-05 19:09:37 @Nike @Kaepernick7 no need to worry about the plummeting stocks; just goes to show the traders are #WORMS as well.  There are more of us than there are of them and I'll be shopping Nike this weekend.
778 2018-09-05 19:09:27 And finally, better get rid of Puma and Adidas because they wanted Kap too, but he chose Nike. You think these global companies didn’t do a cost benefit analysis or risk assessment? Stocks panicked so they could sell, and many will buy while it is lower.
779 2018-09-05 19:09:25 Im thinking all stocks are expensive. The results of money pooling at the top. Isn’t normal pe like 15? Historically.

785 2018-09-05 19:06:27 As soon as I noticed that tech doesn’t help much until you have fundamentals and neutral, I stopped focusing on it and worked on basics and my play improved a lot.

811 2018-09-05 18:58:39 I think that should have been ‘is straining environment’. World fish stocks at 10%. Arable land declining. 60 year left of topsoils. Huge methane production of livestock. Inhumanity of Asian meat production & trade. They seriously need to go vegan. As much if not more than anyone

814 2018-09-05 18:58:04 Nike stocks are actually up this morning by about 0.43%; don't believe anything this twat says without thoroughly verifying it.

817 2018-09-05 18:56:30 Wes, what do you call concentrated? 40-50 stocks. I tend to agree on the approach btw. Micro/small caps would do even better but scalability is an issue.
818 2018-09-05 18:56:09 This makes 0 sense. How can Nike only care about money when they’ve lost billions in stocks? They knew based on recent events that this campaign wouldn’t be the most favored and they still to the risk to glorify a reasonable (quiet) protest.
819 2018-09-05 18:55:55 Black People Shouldn’t Be So Fired Up To Just Go Buy  Nike Shoes, As They Should Be To Buying Nike “Stocks” use your head! #dontbelievethehype
820 2018-09-05 18:55:08 I trade stocks and options and have like an 820 credit score, let me love you plz? Also slide in more often I like it
821 2018-09-05 18:55:05 7' Stocks delivery is headed out for a corner but it leads to nothing (0-0).
822 2018-09-05 18:54:26 People make them out to be revolutionary because they‘re doing this despite the hit their stock is gonna take. Funny thing is they don’t have a clue how stocks work and Nike ain’t losing shit over this campaign.

826 2018-09-05 18:53:49 Literature is ambiguous whether superstar companies innovate well.  Past superstars - IBM, Xerox, Polaroid, etc are gone.  Big pharma hasn’t innovated.   Small stocks also outperform big past winners ...

832 2018-09-05 18:51:47 Thats where my question is , keeping the hedge position intact can we create spread positions wherein if stocks falls more than 8 or rises by 8 i shld start earning and if its stuck in range then max loss 8rs.

838 2018-09-05 18:49:42 Playing with stocks is worse than going to the casino. 
839 2018-09-05 18:49:34 Stocks are a much more effective way of financing a business tho. Also the initial tweet was implying actual investments, which is why most ppl in the replies are talking about options and stocks
840 2018-09-05 18:49:32 Are tech stocks already on the edge ? 
Some look ready to print the first lower low in a long time. 
We'll get more info this month i guess.

843 2018-09-05 18:48:56 As their stocks continue to plunge
844 2018-09-05 18:48:42 You are so busy fuming behind your twitter thumbs you failed to notice that Nike's stock has gone up since announcing their Colin Kaepernick ad campaign.
Jut as stocks go up and down so do your endorsements
845 2018-09-05 18:48:41 You can't be that ignorant that you think the 3% drop is because of Kaepernick especially considering Adidas and Pumas dropped similarly. Besides, investors don't give a shit about day to day stocks. All that matters are quarterly numbers

853 2018-09-05 18:47:49 Stocks rise and fall everyday 4.2 billion is 2% of what they make. They’ve lost more if you seen my picture in previous months. Please go back and learn stocks. And I’m not a liberal. I’m a realist. I hope you’re not this dense in real life.
854 2018-09-05 18:47:25 Yo Becky.  Stocks almost $80 a share. I think the shareholders will be happy.
855 2018-09-05 18:47:22 But consumer theme is a sureshot for MFs. It is an ongoing growth story. Stocks can betray but MFs won't.
856 2018-09-05 18:47:16 Apple was last this expensive (17.2x NTM earnings) in Oct. of 2010 when the company grew earnings 96% in 2011.  Currently $AAPL is expected to grow earnings 9% next year.  17x is not that expensive and they have more services and dividend now - but c'mon.  $QQQ #Apple #stocks
857 2018-09-05 18:47:11 One of my bigger struggles in trading alts is trying to detach from the mindset I've built trading equities.

Only thing comparable is trading penny stocks.

If one keeps panicking at 15, 20% moves, and DCA at the wrong time, you cost yourself a lot of money.

Still working on it

861 2018-09-05 18:45:59 Just think like it's Disney Stocks in 1997 Evangelical Boycott that failed. Disney is still here. What you don't get, liberal money is just as good as conservative money..Nike knows who's putting butter on their bread.They just secured a 10 yr contact w/ NFL. They secured first.

872 2018-09-05 18:42:43 Lol. Nike isn't just sneakers, it's more... And their stocks tanked after that ad
873 2018-09-05 18:42:22 So?? Writers are like stocks. Past performance does not forecast future performance.
874 2018-09-05 18:42:16 Who tryna sell me some nike stocks since y’all boycotting 
875 2018-09-05 18:42:04 Nah we sold those stocks. Your hero and Nike failed and stock fell. Sorry

878 2018-09-05 18:41:55 I sure do. I also realize 4.2 billion dollars is a huge cap loss and that although the stocks are showing up today they are not a recovery so save your condescending comments for an uneducated liberal puppet. #JustBlewIt
879 2018-09-05 18:41:46 Y’all really don’t know shit about stocks.

881 2018-09-05 18:40:58 Clearly I know how stocks work. Also I never liked my own tweet so relax over there AJ. Nike dropped on Tuesday like everyone else did. This has zero relevance to the ad here in the US. Actually more than half their sales come from outside the US.

I bet you all agree on 1 and yet many of us don't cut their losing positions short.

890 2018-09-05 18:37:29 They sold their stocks in Nike. How barbaric!!
891 2018-09-05 18:36:55 With this approach, you can stay away from any sort of black swan land mines regarding earnings or other potential bad news, although I also love the momentum, speculative runs SPs have.  Got to have a process of to control risk/reward vs. stocks' valuations vs. profits/losses.

903 2018-09-05 18:33:15 I can now confirm that I no long hold any Nike stocks and the brand has been flushed from my household. Am now spreading word to my family and friends.
904 2018-09-05 18:33:15 If the Dems take the House, the whole damn market is going to tank, and no one is going to remember or care in particular what happened to Dick's, Nike or Levi stocks. Just a little perspective.

908 2018-09-05 18:32:39 Don’t be an arse get the facts first the area was not fished by the French to preserve stocks EU allowed British to fish there as part of a wider compromise! The French were not happy as there conservation of the stock was being compromised so they acted to preserve it a result.
909 2018-09-05 18:32:17 Nike stocks are up.
910 2018-09-05 18:32:06 Stocks will rally from their current or lower positions.
911 2018-09-05 18:31:43 stick around or anticipate further earnings growth. Easier for SPs to come in when there is so much already priced in. Therefore, I aint chasing and try to pick stocks like a SIS or if in same space as WEED, id try the less than $1B marketcap ones with SPs $10 or less b4 WEED.
912 2018-09-05 18:30:58 Nike stocks going back up. Idk what Trump talking about

914 2018-09-05 18:30:36 FYI- Some investors in emerging markets just want 2 get out!

915 2018-09-05 18:30:33 yes Nike is happy !!!!!, they are weaning out all the racist people that #45 brought to light...everyone's stock fell today... go check with your buddy in the white house as to why the stocks fell....it had nothing to do with Colin.
916 2018-09-05 18:30:33 Buy Nike stocks instead of they shoes! That’s how we can show our support. We gotta be smarter man.

923 2018-09-05 18:29:49 I'm a millennial and have been out of stocks for the past decade...just got back in this past week with S&P call options
924 2018-09-05 18:29:47 I want to get into stocks, seriously.
925 2018-09-05 18:29:06 I love how they’re defending a multinational corporation that’s been known to use sweatshops for being “progressive”. The $4 billion drop in NIKE’s stocks was also amusing - get woke, go broke. 
926 2018-09-05 18:28:51 Honestly, I don't recall but it was probably picking stocks that will outperform. That was the usual topic.
927 2018-09-05 18:28:28 "Go buy stocks in Nike" lol everyone thinks they're cool now

931 2018-09-05 18:27:25 As someone who strongly values personal finance, I would love for people to care as much about stocks and the market as they do when Nike goes down 1% after advocating something that person doesn’t like...
932 2018-09-05 18:27:18 And just like that Nike stocks rebound. While the other companies continue to fall. But hey keep burning your clothes Nike already for the money for. That’ll show em

942 2018-09-05 18:23:20 Whether you have real wheels, reps, fake wheels, stocks, whatever, you should check them for stress fractures often to make sure this doesn't happen. Wheels have a finite life and amount of stress they can take.
943 2018-09-05 18:23:09 Yes stocks and real estate will be good hedges to the falling USD. But you'll experience a falling net worth denoted in BTC. Additionally you could argue that housing and stocks are in a bubble(or inflated) because they are seen as a safe haven from the inflationary currencies.

960 2018-09-05 18:16:45 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your carpal tunnel syndrome
961 2018-09-05 18:16:29 The Democrats are the biggest laughing stocks in American history they come across like they have no brains feel sorry for anyone that should have to go through this process with them so little class especially when the votes yes in him before.
962 2018-09-05 18:16:29 Nike is fine, I wouldn't buy individual stocks you should look into a portfolio that takes into account the amount of risk you want to take on. Low risk usually means long term gain, high risk usually means short term gain. I don't think Nike is a high risk stock. Grain of salt.
963 2018-09-05 18:16:27 Je pense que la gestion des stocks se fait à la main, car avant de m'encaisser, la vente a été enregistrée sur un grand cahier 
964 2018-09-05 18:16:13 And I was born in Kansas :) stick to the grill Gary Coleman, stocks isn't for you
965 2018-09-05 18:16:01 You know trading is your passion when in your break at your job you analize charts and check the stocks in play while others go to FB or IG taking selfies and watch stupid non-sense videos in Youtube #Lovetheprocess
966 2018-09-05 18:15:55 $TLRY Tilray September 21 $95 puts only $21.35 last trade, now on sale for $20 bucks. Consider buying puts or selling calls on leading LP stocks to protect profits.

968 2018-09-05 18:15:36 So #Kaepernick signs on with Nike, stocks go down, and people burn their shoes. Hey #Kaepernick, maybe you should sign on with the NRA too, really get some shit done. 
969 2018-09-05 18:15:11 Rêvons pas... même si une belle choppe Racing (une belle pas leurs mini trucs) en 50cl je crois qu’il y a rupture de stocks pendant 6 mois
970 2018-09-05 18:15:04 Wow, people making a mad dash for dividend stocks. $VYM is +.36% atm
971 2018-09-05 18:14:55 I’m fuckin wit Nike shit I’m tryna invest in some stocks
972 2018-09-05 18:14:55 So you are trying to say Nike didn’t actually lose 4.1 billion in market value when they announced their new brand spokesman? And you are using this mornings stock report that shows it’s slightly recovered some of its drop as evidence? Do you know how stocks work?
973 2018-09-05 18:14:52 A lot of stocks on support today. Taking some longs but we might see a really red week next week
974 2018-09-05 18:14:18 And yet their stocks have gone up. You silly egit.
975 2018-09-05 18:14:18 I was stating a fact about that particular day........after a particular event. I think most people know stocks go up and down. Thanks for the inside Info. Have a good day!
976 2018-09-05 18:14:01 Pot stocks totally high $CRON $CGC $TLRY 

Disclose: Long  $CRON and SEP calls
977 2018-09-05 18:13:53 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
978 2018-09-05 18:13:42 So that’s why their stocks plunged or unrelated?
979 2018-09-05 18:13:39 Economy is good for 1%, not 99%. Wages stagnant, gas almost $4, minimum wage $7.00, prices going through roof, seniors cut pills in half. 

The RICH got BILLIONS in tax cuts.

TRUMP cut food stamps.

The Dow is meaningless to 99% of us who don't have stocks.
980 2018-09-05 18:13:34 That’s not how stocks work
981 2018-09-05 18:13:11 So I am trying out stock PS4 sticks, no kontrol Freeks. Does anyone like the old domed stocks from the ps3 better?
982 2018-09-05 18:12:21 Wait.... aren't you the conspiracy nut that told everyone to sell all their stocks because Trump was going to tank the market immediately upon arrival? Hahahaha can I have your permission to use this tweet on a large forum this Saturday?
983 2018-09-05 18:12:16 chinese stocks have one more leg down and then we should get a great buying opportunity

985 2018-09-05 18:11:42 Like steel prices and stock in those that produce it. Shorting foreign stocks in tech company's just before announcing that they're banned. I know what you're doing
986 2018-09-05 18:11:34 Their stocks just went up
987 2018-09-05 18:11:29 My stock portfolio skyrocketed. Thank you weed stocks, and thank you God #goodday
988 2018-09-05 18:11:20 Hit them harder and short their stocks.
989 2018-09-05 18:11:15 fact: if you own stocks, you should prefer to see your stocks on the new highs list instead of the new lows list
990 2018-09-05 18:11:14 I feel like there are so many Canadians who remain (for some reason) unwilling to own U.S. stocks despite the much stronger trend over the past decade (yes, that is 10 years) - stubborn?  foolish?  closed-minded?  not sure how exactly to explain it
991 2018-09-05 18:10:56 in case today is your first day as a new stock market participant, a good rule of thumb when buying individual stocks is to assume the worst case scenario is the one you're buying goes to zero.  budget accordingly.
992 2018-09-05 18:10:35 Someone needs to help you read the stocks! NFL looks like it has full seating and Nike is doing fine. Where do you get your data for anything?
993 2018-09-05 18:09:34 Nike stocks are way up!
994 2018-09-05 18:09:24 Wish i knew more about stocks
995 2018-09-05 18:09:00 One good thing about this whole Nike thing is that people are going to be selling their stocks and I’m going to be buyingggg
996 2018-09-05 18:08:47 Do not sell stocks in September. Do not sign up for a new electricity provider in July, August, or September.
997 2018-09-05 18:08:42 $CRON holding this one still. Up $1200 so far! Expecting weed stocks to continue rising 
998 2018-09-05 18:08:24 Never said it never went down yesterday, just reckless to look at a one day sample size when they have already regained back 1.3 billion today. Stocks go up and down, look at the past year and see how many times Nike lost 2% in the day, the answer is multiple.
999 2018-09-05 18:07:52 If u dont get outa here with yr old salty ass,  yr just mad over an advertisement that yr old man dickhead trump doesn’t like nd yr just salty of the fact that nike is doing good on there stocks you thought that they were gonna go down but that aint the case
1000 2018-09-05 18:07:37 Wow. A small pop in the Argentina peso (+0.003 cents, or just under 2%) has led to a rally in Argentina stocks. At this point, the risk/reward just seems really attractive. Holding my position in $BMA (it's peeling faces today).

1012 2018-09-05 18:05:20 @carterthomas Would love to see a video about pot stocks, which is looking like it's going to be 2018's crypto bubble; if you're into this (aside from $CGC)
1013 2018-09-05 18:05:17 Haha take your alt-right nonsense somewhere else. You'd have to be some kind of stupid to sweat a 1 day market cap on a company as big as Nike. You know stocks go up and down sometimes right?
1014 2018-09-05 18:04:18 short ur tesla stocks immidiately
1015 2018-09-05 18:04:02 can’t wait for my Econ professor to read my paper that was suppose to be about Nike stocks dropping but really is about EQUALITY AND HOW RACIST ASS PEOPLE ARE THOTS
1016 2018-09-05 18:03:50 Nike stocks are booming rn
1017 2018-09-05 18:02:50 Where do I buy stocks in Nike? #nikejustdoit #NIKETakesAKnee #NikeKaepernick
1018 2018-09-05 18:02:00 I’m lowkey trying to invest in stocks
1019 2018-09-05 18:01:48 Boeing is a good example and a name we have held for years, partly because of how cheap it was, it is currently roughly in the cheapest 20% of stocks by P/E, Cash Flow, EBITDA, etc.  but its P/B ratio is around 400 making it one of the most expensive names by P/B.
1020 2018-09-05 18:01:46 If people were smart, right now would be the perfect time to buy stocks from Nike
1021 2018-09-05 18:01:43 not true. Most of the "tax cut" went to corporations buying back their own stocks to reward their shareholders. A very small amount trickled down to workers. This was a tax cut for the wealthy and for wealthy corporations to pay their shareholders. That is the reality.
1022 2018-09-05 18:01:23 I guess I still have a problem understanding how a document written a couple of centuries ago should be interpreted as written, given it is silent on so many things. I don't know how bump stocks are allowed, but other stuff isn't, or how corporations are people.
1023 2018-09-05 18:01:14 They all jumping to weed stocks now
1024 2018-09-05 18:00:37 I need to go ahead and buy me some stocks
1025 2018-09-05 18:00:26 We sure as hell taught those unruly Muslim countries a thing or two during Desert Storm.  And they've been teaching us a thing or two ever since.

Meanwhile, "defense" industry stocks are up.

1035 2018-09-05 17:56:43 Nike stocks have gone up and adidas stocks have gone down 
1036 2018-09-05 17:56:42 Ratings down? I thought you were a “business guy” but I guess you wouldn’t understand since most of your businesses failed. Nike is one of the top grossing companies and their stocks are up! What is WAY DOWN is you’re failing ratings as a President because of tweets like this.
1037 2018-09-05 17:56:36 You'll have to open a verified account to get your stocks. Nike stocks can't be bought at the store. Stocks don't come in a box. Thoughts do tho, clearly. You don't even have to buy them, you can borrow. Since half my TL just turned into market experts.. lol #spikedtea 
1038 2018-09-05 17:56:31 The reactions i'm seeing to $TLRY movement reminds me of the reaction to internet stocks in 2000.
1039 2018-09-05 17:56:27 The uranium stocks were holding up well until today. They are not getting sold
1040 2018-09-05 17:55:40 Buying stocks is always a risk, however when a stock is down that’s when you should most likely buy it. Tesla will eventually go back up.
1041 2018-09-05 17:55:39 Don't the large "we gotta' put some money to work" institutions love high-priced (note I did not say expensive) stocks?  I hear it keeps the peasants from playing in their favorites...

1047 2018-09-05 17:54:39 Buy some stocks in Nike. They’re worth less than Air Max’s and Jordan’s.
1048 2018-09-05 17:54:23 stocks I use as barometers still filling gaps down side, line in sand for me is a close over 2903. not there yet.  already seeing signs of reversal.
1049 2018-09-05 17:54:01 If ya’ll really wanted to invest in some stocks NIKE is pretty affordable right now. $80 a share lol get on
1050 2018-09-05 17:53:59 He doesn’t even understand stocks, nor do most of these people who think their boycott made a difference. Nike is up while most of their competitors are still down from yesterday.
1051 2018-09-05 17:53:59 The hilarity of this whole deal is people thinking NIKE didn’t know what they were doing. Also hilarious is poorly all of yesterday’s pundit opinions about stocks dropping aged. It wasn’t 18 hours before they all looked stupid.
1052 2018-09-05 17:53:52 He was being facetious. The stocks were all down coz of a selloff due to tariffs fears
1053 2018-09-05 17:53:29 Based on historical measures we know when stocks have had relatively “high” or “low” valuations, much harder to determine “over” valuation and by extension profit from it

My guess is, A will turn out far better than however you propose to handle the presumption that B is true...
1054 2018-09-05 17:53:22 Nike is not loosing business . Stocks and products went GREEN today in fact the world buying more the US market is only 2% of business .....

1060 2018-09-05 17:51:48 Correction Oops. Hit the wrong button.  Meant to tap “stocks.”
1061 2018-09-05 17:51:47 Its a blip and will recover soon. People like you who don't know anything about stocks should avoid talking about them.
1062 2018-09-05 17:51:33 Hey bro, read that before hand but do you which stocks was he investing in?
1063 2018-09-05 17:51:11 Lol it's just the way market works makes no sense and lool at how pot stocks are doing making millions but worth billions crazy
1064 2018-09-05 17:50:58 I very often sold a stock on a 5% down day. If you had to sell to limit your losses, do this immediately. But have patience, because in 2-3 days it could be on new highs. Strong stocks stay strong.
1065 2018-09-05 17:50:53 One of my stocks just went up 16 cents and I def wanna sell it before it goes down ..  Ima chill tho
1066 2018-09-05 17:50:52 Update for you #MAGA lovers 

Stocks are up 
1067 2018-09-05 17:50:30 Let’s not start the debate of holding stocks long term because a shoe flipper can flip more shoes in a years time and have more value then say a stock that goes up 50%

1071 2018-09-05 17:49:02 Remember what Jordan said...”Republicans buys sneakers, too”.   You might see a slight boost in stocks due to all the hype...but eventually it will drop....Nike will loose millions if not billions from this...#BanNike !!
1072 2018-09-05 17:48:53 Concentrate on your #trading process. Sell your weakest #stocks, buy stronger ones and add to your winners. You will never catch the high of a trend, but make sure the middle is big enough.

1076 2018-09-05 17:48:03 Lol he forgets to add that a lot of it is because he decided to just pull out of NAFTA which is why all these companies stocks are dropping

1086 2018-09-05 17:46:09 If you see a pullback in the market, look at your #stocks and the indices in the weekly chart and ask yourself: Are they in a negative environment? Often the answer is no! Have patience with your biggest winners.
1087 2018-09-05 17:46:07 @Nike will be too when their stocks continue to fall!
1088 2018-09-05 17:46:02 Hey did I miss where @Nike dropped @Kaepernick7 cause there stock started rising and did @Twitter & @Microsoft endorse him?  Their stocks dropped 2-4%  same as @Nike and I don’t here the blame. #stocks correct all the time.
1089 2018-09-05 17:45:40 Pot met kettle @chucktodd is a fear monger. Remember just last Friday, do not miss work something big...and nothing just a load of horse 
1090 2018-09-05 17:45:38 Listen here you bumbling idiot, Adidas and Puma also saw a 2+ % drop in their stocks yesterday too. They didn’t employ Kap. Those stocks are all down because of your terrible NAFTA negotiations. Stick to what it is you do best, dividing you country and colluding with the enemy.

1094 2018-09-05 17:44:34 Why do I get the sudden urge to buy stocks in Nike 
1095 2018-09-05 17:44:33 We’re all in agreement there. Where I thought we differed was whether a portfolio composed of stocks that are cheap by your favorite measure of value would screen as value by a P/B screen. My guess was yes, but to his point maybe that doesn’t matter.
1096 2018-09-05 17:44:28 pot stocks on fire.. again

1098 2018-09-05 17:43:54 dude chill - i have a bunch of bio stocks that haven't moved much this year and a few that are down. fortunately, my tech investments have done v. well.
1099 2018-09-05 17:43:46 Wow pot stocks really running. $TLRY trying to hit $100
1100 2018-09-05 17:43:26 Funny because in one day Nike lost 7% in stocks... That's huge in the stoke market
1101 2018-09-05 17:43:22 Not for sale sorry, I personally feel pot stocks will eventually become their own high growth market sector that will rival tech.
1102 2018-09-05 17:43:16 You are stating false comments about Nike Trump.. Their stocks are up.
1103 2018-09-05 17:42:44 Nike execs are sleeping GREAT at night knowing that a small hit to their stocks is happening because its NOT about money, football, the anthem, the flag, or troops. Its about EQUALITY. Something you've proven time and time again to have no knowledge about.
1104 2018-09-05 17:42:15 It keeps me on my toes. So far all my stocks have been doing really well. But this one just took me by surprise 
1105 2018-09-05 17:41:23 The overwhelming point here is that absolutely no one gives one shit about what he has to say nor cares that billion dollar corporations stocks are down
1106 2018-09-05 17:40:40 "It Will Get A Lot Worse": Global Stocks Tumble As EM Contagion Roils Markets
 
"This has become now an issue which is no longer just about EM fundamentals. It's increasingly about contagion, which largely happens because of cross-holdings and the pressure of redemptions.”
1107 2018-09-05 17:40:37 Stocks are addicting
1108 2018-09-05 17:40:32 NIKE is promoting freedom of speech, NFL is demonstrating against police violence. BOTH ARE A GOOD THING. NIKE stocks aren't down, and NFL still has there fans. So cut the bullshit TRUMP, I think you got bigger things to worry about.

1109 2018-09-05 17:40:27 There are 1000s of stocks on the market, yet you specifically target those of people you dislike. 

Don’t think you really have a leg to stand on anymore

 carry on focussing on your own stocks, your insecurity emits a smell of desperation 

Good luck
1110 2018-09-05 17:40:05 I really want someone to teach me about stocks. YouTube videos are boring.
1111 2018-09-05 17:39:52 Just read that as crypto tanks, again, cannabis stocks are soaring! Correlation isn’t causation, but ....
1112 2018-09-05 17:39:52 Alors , je précise que c est la nouvelle ministre de la santé,proclamée hier sur Twitter, qui répond et qui n a pas cache qu elle avait des stocks de vaccins à écouler en complicité avec Roselyne Bachelot. Tout est vérifiable sur twitter
1113 2018-09-05 17:39:34 $TLRY $CGC $NEPT $IVITF $CRON $TGODF $IGC $MJ - Marijuana stocks in play
1114 2018-09-05 17:39:10 Bring back the stocks and whipping post.
1115 2018-09-05 17:38:55 Wow @Nike stocks are back up? Lmfao  that didn't take long.
1116 2018-09-05 17:38:54 So how are your stocks doing?
1117 2018-09-05 17:38:47 What weed stocks brother?
1118 2018-09-05 17:37:21 I have not & probably over complicating it. If $10K invested in S&P and say Nike is 1% (making up), you would just short $100. Ideally put on trade at the same time. Easier than buying 499 stocks. Interesting to create a S&P tracking fund that could remove some stocks
1119 2018-09-05 17:37:16 @neznargo   I'm putting on a reality news series for vice based on people trying to pump up stocks on Twitter based on rumors.  Let's talk, I'll listen
1120 2018-09-05 17:37:11 Which  pot stocks are set to fly?
1121 2018-09-05 17:37:07 It’s the stock market it does go up and down and did you check the other sports stocks that were also down?  adidas 1.8% , Puma 3.84 % ....
1122 2018-09-05 17:37:05 Additionally - it painfully obvious you have an agenda 

You dislike certain people and unsuccessfully try to garner negative attention on their stocks using baseless facts & ‘sources’ - if you had actual investigative talent, you’d be working for the FT or FCA- but you don’t
1123 2018-09-05 17:36:37 I’m trying to capitalize and invest while these stocks are unstable
1124 2018-09-05 17:36:32 Are you perhaps suggesting that shareholders should short their stocks? :3
1125 2018-09-05 17:36:20 Short it against a move near $100 IMO .. but who knows, tons of momo and fomo going on and the US runs stocks up hard but also crashes them hard too
1126 2018-09-05 17:36:18 good thing I decided to pull out my stocks a year ago
1127 2018-09-05 17:36:13 Are you only looking at Nike stocks, or are you also interested in the rest of the shoe business? All of the industry had plummeting stocks because of uncertainty with the NAFTA deal. Trade wars are good though, remember that.
1128 2018-09-05 17:36:03 Now it's up 6%. What a day. You have to love illiquid stocks.
1129 2018-09-05 17:35:59 Some old redneck hill billy thinks she knows anything about stocks haha
1130 2018-09-05 17:35:58 Have you checked the stocks today? ......
1131 2018-09-05 17:35:55 Ought to get me some stocks in Nike, they probably cheap as hell rn LOL
1132 2018-09-05 17:35:10 Get out and off of Wall Street. Invest in God's people. Dump those stocks. 

John 11:35.
1133 2018-09-05 17:35:05 Got a bonus and more stocks #cashmeoutside
1134 2018-09-05 17:35:04 No, the BIGLYEST nightmare is Trump, UNLESS one is heavily invested in stocks. Loose cannon with no safety, & a faulty switch. Period. Sad.
1135 2018-09-05 17:34:21 Stocks Slammed After Tech-Regulation Looms From Congress
 
Senator Mark Warner: "Congress will have to set social media regulations."
1136 2018-09-05 17:34:15 The GDP is 4.6% & rising. Minorities are at their highest employment rate in decades=people back to work AND helping themselves=not on welfare. Booming economy. Stocks are at their highest in history. And you're worried about the 1% who make it happen?
1137 2018-09-05 17:33:59 Even XLE can climb all the way back with oil still down 150bps. Stocks just find a way to climb again.
1138 2018-09-05 17:33:57 Básicamente, el segundo mandato de Cristina se basó en manotear dos fuentes de recursos: 1) quemar stocks y 2) intercambiar futuro por presente. En 1) tenés, como más obvio, el uso de reservas y manotear dólares de donde se pudo (contratos con China y Chevron, licitación 4G).
1139 2018-09-05 17:33:41 Day trading stocks got me like 
1140 2018-09-05 17:33:04 OMG some logic in this thread! THANK YOU! My portfolio is primarily in #Cannabis #eSports & #Renewables plus a few tradition #stocks to anchor it.
1141 2018-09-05 17:32:42 Stocks are not up. They rebounded a little from yesterday. But still significantly down.
1142 2018-09-05 17:32:24 $PPCB was $0.004 on 8/24, today 9/5, less than 2 weeks later, its hits an intraday high of $0.2888 and still holding $0.24's... This is why we play PENNY STOCKS
1143 2018-09-05 17:32:17 good thing pot stocks here to prop up over all market $TLRY, $CGC, $CRON, $AAPL, $AMZN
1144 2018-09-05 17:32:04 Nike stocks went up 
1145 2018-09-05 17:32:03 Cover his marijuana stocks short position
1146 2018-09-05 17:31:59 Wild day, down 8K at lows of the day b/c of marijuana and other stocks, now down about 3K as many stocks have bounced, in some cases to be green for the day. Traders love the action. Buy and holders love the dips to buy. Naïve and weak hands learn valuable lessons for LT trading.

1153 2018-09-05 17:30:25 Now is a good time to buy @Nike stocks.
1154 2018-09-05 17:30:13 Stocks up there big boy. Keep talking chump.
1155 2018-09-05 17:29:55 I can't speak for other people.
But I can personally can say.
It would be foolish to sale pot stocks.
1156 2018-09-05 17:29:55 Looks like bump stocks are back on the menu, boys.

1158 2018-09-05 17:29:24 Plot twist Nike stocks are up .52%
1159 2018-09-05 17:29:16 It can't be a bad selloff in the U.S. bc we're talking about pot stocks
1160 2018-09-05 17:29:16 Perhaps the Austrians were on to something when they talked about low interest rates leading to malinvestment.

On the other hand, maybe commodity agriculture/retail stocks with no barriers to entry should trade at 20x revenue.
1161 2018-09-05 17:29:11 If you’re smart you’ll buy Nike stocks right now. @Nike
1162 2018-09-05 17:28:55 The pot stocks are high.
1163 2018-09-05 17:28:36 That would be like saying setting fire to your own foot would be a good idea. Unless your business is in short-selling UK stocks, of course.
1164 2018-09-05 17:28:35 Don't believe the bullshit. Most apparel stocks are down (because of Donny's tarrifs?) Not only nike. Hope they report when the stock bounces back up again. Right?
1165 2018-09-05 17:28:17 trump just spoke out against nike ! time to buy some stocks while they're cheap !!
1166 2018-09-05 17:28:12 Don’t know much about that except stocks have struggled there. Just saw Aussie gdp beat ag 3.4%. That doesn’t really speak to China issues in many areas.
1167 2018-09-05 17:27:59 Of course Nike knew what would happen, dump stocks-pump and dump!  As for the NFL, we are done with them and their endless pockets of cash.
1168 2018-09-05 17:27:21 @Inspir8tion8 Raft of sells expected by market makers hence the aggressive marking down of #Aim stocks
Selling wont happen imo
1169 2018-09-05 17:26:37 They didn't lose any money. Whatever you guys want yo go on about with this, the whole "Nike is losing billions" just shows a complete ignorance of stocks and the finances involved.
1170 2018-09-05 17:26:35 How long until the global market cap of cannabis stocks exceeds alcohol stocks? Friday?
1171 2018-09-05 17:26:31 Lmao people swear they know stocks now and think Nike is in trouble

1175 2018-09-05 17:26:20 Age 21 to own a gun, ban ARs that hold large capacity magazines, background checks for all , ban bump stocks.

1181 2018-09-05 17:25:03 Serious statement: I think some of the weakness in $TSLA $TSLAQ is retail money moving from EV's to Cannabis stocks. Cannabis is the new cool hot thing (without any supporting financials to justify the price) that retail bagholders and to tell their friends they're investing in
1182 2018-09-05 17:24:49 I’m looking to get into some of these stocks any suggestion on timing about it, I take it from your short that you think it’s going down
1183 2018-09-05 17:24:40 $CRON kissed that $13 and expecting a much bigger run towards the end of today! Keep watch here as cannabis stocks continue to rise
1184 2018-09-05 17:24:38 Nike stocks have jumped 18% lol
1185 2018-09-05 17:24:35 Which means its the perfect time to invest in their stocks. They’ll go up again.

1190 2018-09-05 17:23:33 Thanks #Obama ! Mine too. What #GOP is doing is for corps, rich & to get re-elected. Not everyone has stocks. Not everyone owns a large corporation or part of the top 5% income. For each coal or steel job saved/created many more lost. Removing regulations favor corps not people.

1196 2018-09-05 17:22:25 4.7 Billion for what? Fake Agenda. A False Narrative. The CEO/Board of ANY CO. that mixes Politics w/Business should be REMOVED. PPL OWN STOCKS IN THESE COS. RETIREMENT 401K'S ? THEYRE MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON PURE POLITICAL PROPOGANDA. ONCE A CO. DOES THIS, ID NEVER BUY STOCK.
1197 2018-09-05 17:22:06 There is a direct link between stock prices and the effort to do away with ACA - why are MCO stocks keep going up without any planning or investments into keeping or meeting the guidelines for ACA.  Are there any investigations that DOJ has on ACA exploitation before it ends?
1198 2018-09-05 17:21:48 Pro tip on when to sell the weed stocks: when Kodak announces their weed division $tlry $kodk $cgc

1201 2018-09-05 17:21:22 i needa start investing in stocks, gotta learn all that.
1202 2018-09-05 17:21:11 Referring to them as “Pot Stocks” only feeds into a exhausted form of negative rhetoric used to describe Cannabis. These “Cannabis Stocks” can only grow in value, especially with the increase demand for CBD and other medicinal applications. @jimcramer
1203 2018-09-05 17:21:02 And demand is dead???
It will be interesting to see the final ending stocks at the end of the month.....
1204 2018-09-05 17:20:54 I think the problem with this country is the ppl fight over democrats and republicans when neither party are for the ppl of this country all they care about is stocks and shares we need a new party that cares about all the ppl not just creation categories

1219 2018-09-05 17:17:32 It's only paper, Dude. Stocks lose "billions" in market value every day. It's only a loss if you sell your shares at a loss.

1238 2018-09-05 17:11:42 Colin Kaepernick is an activist for racial equality. Nike gave him their backing. It seems to me that you are admitting that you are a racist (not patriot as we already know since you are ok with Russia hijacking our election). #blm #buynike stocks and shoes #JustDoIt

1243 2018-09-05 17:10:54 So telling, and so sad that for 2 years in a row now our local food bank has put in a desperate plea for donations because their stocks have been depleted during the school hols.
1244 2018-09-05 17:10:46 At the end of the day yesterday, they said the ad had exposed them to 48 million in new sales. Of course the company lost 3.7 billion in stocks, but yeah, its a bad idea.

1247 2018-09-05 17:10:16 Whoever at @Nike came up with this marketing plan is a genius.  They know our people are the biggest market for their shoes so they use us and our issues to sell to Us. They don't really care and that same 4 billion they loosing in stocks they gaining in shoe sales. #staywoke

1279 2018-09-05 17:01:15 Just because I don’t agree with someone or something doesn’t make me racist or ignorant, it just means I have a different opinion. And quite a few people don’t like this move by Nike, just check their stocks...
1280 2018-09-05 17:01:10 Nike clearly understood what would happen if they chose kaepeenick. They chose to make a statement, that I support. Since then Nike stocks have gone up, if people want to trash their own Nike apparel then go ahead they already bought it.

1304 2018-09-05 16:55:27 Consumer confidence, housing market and stocks. Without people having jobs and spending by investments and durable goods nothing matters
1305 2018-09-05 16:54:57 Quietly thinks, there are so many problems of society that dueling would actually address.  That and bringing back the stocks for minor offenses.
1306 2018-09-05 16:54:49 So no, you don't own stocks. That's what I thought. Only someone who isn't an investor thinks yesterday is a big deal or any evidence of Nike's decline. But hey if it helps you sleep at night by all means keep thinking this means something.
1307 2018-09-05 16:54:46 Good opportunity to buy some stocks. Down days always take you up!

1313 2018-09-05 16:53:51 Well it’s only up like 0.62 so it’s the market evening itself out. I’m not saying it’s not people going out and buying Nike, I’m just saying Elliot effect after controversy is typical in stocks

1316 2018-09-05 16:53:34 After a huge hit in the stocks, Nike seems to be climbing again in the market. Still nowhere near where they were a couple of days ago. 

The Kaep news is getting the company relentless coverage on all media platforms.
1317 2018-09-05 16:53:25 This is following the normal process. Company gets bad PR and stocks drop. Trump tweets about it. Company's stocks soar!
1318 2018-09-05 16:53:05 Purchased a few @Nike stocks today!!!
1319 2018-09-05 16:53:01 Invest in Retirement stock like Cocacola, Pepsi, etc. and never sell those stocks until you’re ready to retire on your earnings. Reinvest your dividends back in the stock. Purchase stock that you support on a daily basis.

1323 2018-09-05 16:52:27 les représentants du personnels, dans les petites communes, c'est pas toujours évident à trouver. Et personne n'arrive à comprendre qu'on ne gère pas des dossiers ou des stocks mais des enfants. Difficile de lever le pied, quand ça va pas faut gérer quand même.
1324 2018-09-05 16:52:12 I’d much rather take $5-10k and either buy into a local business are start my own. Stocks is something you get into when you are already rich, not necessarily to make you rich.

1329 2018-09-05 16:51:45 Gold stocks feel like they are about to throw up again.
1330 2018-09-05 16:51:41 Yes but look at the retail froth in AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, and AMD.  Retail not listening to the WS banks.  Hard to say those stocks reflect anything but pure greed and speculation, at a minimum way ahead of themselves..
1331 2018-09-05 16:51:38 Weak take Clay. You spent all day yesterday talking stocks. Not so much today. Nike's the only major shoe company in the green today. So all your rants yesterday about Nike making the worst decision ever already aren't looking so hot.
1332 2018-09-05 16:50:43 Stocks and shares
1333 2018-09-05 16:50:41 Buy me stocks so I know it’s real
1334 2018-09-05 16:50:41 you seen those stocks tho?
1335 2018-09-05 16:50:38 Why are you such a divider? You should be trying to bring this message to the Forefront. Nike is. So their stocks plunged a little bit might be a good idea to buy some while they're cheap then they'll go up again.

But, he should disclose his ownership on every appearance on @cnbcfastmoney.
1339 2018-09-05 16:49:18 My dad is getting into stocks, which is awesome, but he better not come asking me for money if he loses all of his. That’s part of the experience.
1340 2018-09-05 16:49:12 Because rich people bought it when it fell yesterday knowing it would bounce back so they made money on both sides of the coin. The Kappler fans and non fans.  Everyone looks after themselves.  Thanks to Trump stocks are up. A lot. People are employed. U can thank Trump for that

1347 2018-09-05 16:47:41 Nike could care less about the loss yesterday, their concern is Trump renegotiating the trade deals. If he does what he says he will, Nike’s profit will be cut in half, stocks will plummet. That is the reason behind their new campaign.
1348 2018-09-05 16:47:22 This was definitely planned, however, Kap was not in the room when they discussed the stocks dropping. You better believe Nike knew that was gonna happen!! . Who else knew??

1351 2018-09-05 16:46:38 I thought Trump was the best businessman. That is what his folks keep telling us! Wouldn't you know about stocks if you were a good businessman!?! I will take his followers not knowing because they are not that smart!!
1352 2018-09-05 16:46:31 Stocks opened modestly lower and are currently trying to erase the losses.
1353 2018-09-05 16:46:14 While I totally agree that this won't have any effect on long term stocks, using the 1-day graph to try prove a point is just embarrassing. Every stock fluctuates like that. Nike actually had a 3-4% drop which is somewhat significant for those couple hours, but not in long run.

I understand taxes are tricky and you get K-1's which I have never used before.  I would love it you wrote an article k-1's and the tax reporting it difficult.

Don't know if Equity Intelligence still has a holding in it, doesn't come up in shareholders with more than one percent.
1371 2018-09-05 16:41:25 What’s a good Etf for marijuana stocks?
1372 2018-09-05 16:40:52 Stocks fluctuate everyday so when y’all read about how much money Nike losing don’t get worked up. When you running a company like @Nike I’m sure they seen their fair share stock decline and will bounce back like always 
1373 2018-09-05 16:40:48 Usually gapaliton nakos 7/11 kanang ing ana nga bottle tapos naay ph level or electrolyte level chu chu. I cant remember. Hehehe manghatag ka ana? Daghan btaw stocks nimo hahahaha
1374 2018-09-05 16:40:47 @Atradeez listen if ur arguing that long term putting money in stocks the right move then yeah obviously it is, but we are nearing a top
1375 2018-09-05 16:40:18 Exactly my point toothe stocks already increased apparently
1376 2018-09-05 16:40:15 Yup! I’d rather own the stocks than the shoes. Personally I do not wear sneakers.
1377 2018-09-05 16:40:06 Man I’m on YouTube reading etc. Considering the possibilities with the turnaround from stocks I HAVE to learn this shit lol
1378 2018-09-05 16:40:05 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1379 2018-09-05 16:39:40 #Nike stocks are up today. I know you’re simple minded, but even you should know stocks go up & down frequently. If they do need to file bankruptcy I’m sure they’ll call you since you’re kinda an expert on failing businesses. #MAGAMyAss
1380 2018-09-05 16:39:22 Stocks hate unpredictability, so there is always a sell at anything coming from the left field. That is not a measure of popularity, which is reflected in the growth of that stock in medium to long term, and is related to business fundamentals.
1381 2018-09-05 16:39:15 Excellent. We need to maintain at least 51% in our marajuana stocks too.
1382 2018-09-05 16:37:58 It’s a blatant attempt to divide the poor and middle class so that the mammoth corporate conglomerates can raise the price of their stocks or at least not see even a temporary dip.
1383 2018-09-05 16:37:14 So Nike stocks dipped cause of #Kaepernick and racists are upset. Oh dear. Think Nike has become my fav sneaker brand again. Going to buy some pairs...been keeping an eye on some. Those Skepta pairs are ill...
1384 2018-09-05 16:37:13 Well, @nike stocks were up in the pre-market so I guess that #BoycottNike thing ain’t working out so well.
1385 2018-09-05 16:37:12 sont pas cons , ils écoulent d’abord leurs stocks de t -shirts sérigraphiés à 18€ .
1386 2018-09-05 16:37:07 Tu ne te positionne jamais juste avant les rapports de stocks du mercredi?
1387 2018-09-05 16:36:38 @JLGNDMusic yo , research up about nike like rn bro. Might be a amazing time to invest cheap as fuck. Cause you know they stocks aint stayin down
1388 2018-09-05 16:35:12 "Nike stocks fell by 2.7 percent on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the company unveiled the Kaepernick ad. That figure may not seem large, in and of itself, but for a multi-billion dollar company, a 2.7 percent drop can account for hundreds of millions of dollars."
1389 2018-09-05 16:34:48 Coat hanger stocks are up 25% during the hearing.
1390 2018-09-05 16:34:46 Nike stocks are up 
1391 2018-09-05 16:34:40 $hmny moving up slowly
1392 2018-09-05 16:34:08 I’d add $EMHTF @EmeraldHealthHQ to your list. They now have the capacity to produce 600M gel caps a yr (gel caps are 25% of $CGC revenues). They are pharma with patents and permission to do things on the medical side that other rec weed stocks aren’t able to. Severely undervalued
1393 2018-09-05 16:34:01 From a personal standpoint Trump has fucked my life completely. I am without loved ones due to his policies. I did much better with stocks under Obama. My health care has suffered. He seems to want me to die alone, painfully and in poverty. He's the face of evil to me.
1394 2018-09-05 16:33:40 hmm Adidas, Puma, and Under Armour stocks are down so far today but Nike is not so what was that thing about the Colin Kaepernick ad campaign being the beginning of a downfall?
1395 2018-09-05 16:32:56 Only us white folk would come up with such a brave protest of a protest of police brutality by selling our Nike stocks or burning $200 shoes. Sometimes, we really do kind of suck.
1396 2018-09-05 16:31:19 euphoria is so so high. but many stocks still looking solid and not over bounced
1397 2018-09-05 16:31:10 A 2 point turn is not even close to the biggest loss in just this quarter? How hard is it to understand that all stocks go up and down every day? 

Why is that a challenging fact?

1399 2018-09-05 16:30:52 Pot stocks mmmmmmmm got @CanopyGrowth a $19 late last year stop moved to $40 so I doubled worse case I think but would never dare to recommend there’s more hidden gems out there
1400 2018-09-05 16:30:48 I got out a little to early, i trimmed a lot of my growth stocks I sold Square, Baba, I’m transitioning into bonds and behemoths like Google, Apple, as a hedge. The Chinese stock market has also been down so I’m buying there
1401 2018-09-05 16:30:25 Hey peeps,anyone interested in stocks, trading? Send me a message asap.
1402 2018-09-05 16:30:13 Stocks go up and down ... wait for it.
1403 2018-09-05 16:29:38 Stocks are overrated
1404 2018-09-05 16:29:31 Booming for the corporations doing buy backs. When they are done, then what? If the booming economy helps, why are wages stagnant? Oh right because corporations are spending on stocks which is why it is booming.
1405 2018-09-05 16:29:20 Had Nike done that guarantee their stocks would have gone up 4 billion. We’d have bought stock
1406 2018-09-05 16:29:12 Acabo de postear el enlace en un tweet
1407 2018-09-05 16:28:59 teach him abt stocks rn
1408 2018-09-05 16:28:44 having "managed" 4-5 midcap stocks for a couple of years, I won't put even a penny in them.
1409 2018-09-05 16:28:41 how do you find stocks to trade?
1410 2018-09-05 16:28:26 The Senate hearing on social media is over. But social media stocks are still tumbling. $TWTR down 5%. $FB down 1.6%. The empty chair -- aka $GOOGL - down 1.7%. 
1411 2018-09-05 16:27:45 Bro you cant flip mid forever. Gotta trap stocks.
1412 2018-09-05 16:27:33 S/O to @Nike stock dropping bought 4 more shares and when this money hit from all the purchases stocks gonna be booming !!!!
1413 2018-09-05 16:27:32 Do people not know how stocks work? Lmao
1414 2018-09-05 16:27:18 Exactely thats what happened even though today mid reversal in many stocks was so clear to buy them like tsla and amd and i never trade just to sliw down (not over trading) and wait for best setup to enter.
1415 2018-09-05 16:27:17 and stocks are falling lower, though they need to have a program in place to stop trolling..just too many Russian trolls!!
1416 2018-09-05 16:26:59 Supreme court ruling against the ban of construction is a sentimental positive for cement stocks #Grasim could outperform here 

#stockstowatch
1417 2018-09-05 16:26:55 agreed.  i buy, pay on and then pray...

Hopefully some good quality stocks at lower (affordable) prices. 

It's the highly leveraged 100X #TSLA stocks that pose danger. #USA keep buying #AMZN at 159X earnings, 5x revenue =>  good luck with that trade now....
1418 2018-09-05 16:26:38 No encuentro esa información
1419 2018-09-05 16:26:37 I see from bio twitter today that there’s a lot of people who really have no idea what the data for $SRPT has said or shown, comparing it to other stocks. Calling it bad data and saying the stocks overvalued. These are the same kind of people who thought amazon was pricey at $300
1420 2018-09-05 16:26:19 Personally I will never buy anything @Nike again but @POTUS you know what’s gonna happen @Nike will design an American flag shoe @Kaepernick7 will wear them in some commercials and all the sellouts will go buy ad many as possible then @Nike stocks will go back up
1421 2018-09-05 16:26:06 My dad's friend's brother's uncle's Gardner  from Guadalajara told me to buy some pot stocks
1422 2018-09-05 16:25:37 Compare left leaning polls to Nike stocks. Most Americans are NOT leaning socialist left.
1423 2018-09-05 16:25:36 Their stocks took a knee it looks like
1424 2018-09-05 16:24:54 Hi. Our promotional offers are subject to availability while stocks last, and stocks can vary between stores. Which is your local store? We will let the Supply team know you would like to see pomegranate and rose gin liqueur soon.
1425 2018-09-05 16:24:28 MJ stocks are going to help a lot of people become more financially secure!
1426 2018-09-05 16:24:22 Nike stock about to go crazy , so if you play with the stocks now's the time
1427 2018-09-05 16:24:07 Better to use apps or an actual person for stocks??
1428 2018-09-05 16:23:40 Y’all buying Nike products I’m buying stocks work smarter not harder
1429 2018-09-05 16:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Losses for tech and consumer companies sink US stocks
1430 2018-09-05 16:22:55 Its time to invest in penny stocks
1431 2018-09-05 16:22:49 time to buy some Nike stocks maybe?
1432 2018-09-05 16:22:14 supreme ils gèrent mal les stocks ils vont te dire oui alors que tout est out
1433 2018-09-05 16:21:41 Stocks have reacted similarly
1434 2018-09-05 16:21:33 I'm sure it will work out. They will just buy their stocks back low and sell high again.
1435 2018-09-05 16:21:32 Nike stocks do not reflect a Boycott. Come on guys...
1436 2018-09-05 16:21:21 Yo con $TNDM no tengo problema . Shakeout en toda regla . Compre a 42-44. A ver si después de la conferencia que empieza en una hora se va al verde . Y mirad $SENS que la llevo comentando desde el viernes .
1437 2018-09-05 16:21:12 Took me a while. But just backtest it. Calculate all those shaken-out exits as if u held instead and see if you’d be better off sitting on hands. *Note this does not mean holding garbage stocks and zero regard for a stop loss. Im a longer term investor so my approach might b diff
1438 2018-09-05 16:20:39 Brilliant thank you mate, will take a gander
1439 2018-09-05 16:20:26 $BABA algos defending! If this sinks, US and the world will join the party, we will be alone lol #stocks #markets
1440 2018-09-05 16:20:04 i can still do a GO for army bombs under normal ETA. Price is Php 2300 since im coursing this through a supplier. I tried to haggle already ._. But If anyone is interested let me know! I’ll secure stocks from BH first before i open it
1441 2018-09-05 16:19:29 Spot on. Some American traders are already scrambling for water stocks.
1442 2018-09-05 16:19:26 I get paid to handle peoples stocks and bonds and uhhhh this time it’s correct. 
1443 2018-09-05 16:19:10 This is honestly a great idea, their stocks are gonna skyrocket
1444 2018-09-05 16:19:06 Of the companies that I have showing on my stocks app, Nike is the only green right now. I love it
1445 2018-09-05 16:19:03 $MJ stocks nice sell off in the morning today!
1446 2018-09-05 16:18:53 Little bit of everything.  Have bought pennies to $50 stocks and options.  I don't discriminate =0)
1447 2018-09-05 16:18:40 I dont follow? 
1448 2018-09-05 16:18:36 Lmao you sound upset lil fella not my fault you went by a photo instead of the original tweet but again its stocks so if you know stocks it drops and then rises you know like I originally said
1449 2018-09-05 16:18:22 et what about arrêter de produire en masse pour éviter de se retrouver avec des stocks de vêtement, jdcjdr
1450 2018-09-05 16:16:42 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue
1451 2018-09-05 16:16:15 Lmao my original tweet says adidas and other stocks so I posted adidas then later mentioned another so am I still wrong
1452 2018-09-05 16:16:14 Why don’t you ever mention the very fake financial news especially from networks such as cnbc? They constantly push stocks on the public so it’s in your favor not to call them fake news. Meanwhile that is the biggest fake news. Lying to the public that economy is good
1453 2018-09-05 16:16:06 A congressional hearing today into Twitter and Facebook may weigh heavily on those stocks and techs in general today..
1454 2018-09-05 16:16:01 A congressional hearing today into Twitter and Facebook may weigh heavily on those stocks and techs in general today..
1455 2018-09-05 16:15:50 Looks like I’ll be buying Nike stocks  lol
1456 2018-09-05 16:15:49 After a brief rally, US stocks are on the slide again..
1457 2018-09-05 16:15:45 After a brief rally, US stocks are on the slide again..
1458 2018-09-05 16:15:39 Dear boycotters,
 Nike doesn’t care that they won’t get their $30 that you’ve always paid for their shoes. They don’t like those shoes anyways and you haven’t even made a dent in their stocks. They are up today.
1459 2018-09-05 16:15:17 If the competition stops with the 'us vs them' everyone on all sides can benefit. This is why i don't get Tesla shorts. Yall are so intent on Tesla failing and cant or won't see the bigger picture. Stop looking at stocks and start looking at how you can impact the environment
1460 2018-09-05 16:15:09 There are at least 2 ways to look at this: 1) stocks go up and down in the long run and a person is in for the long haul 2) the stock is down right now when I need liquidity. This 2nd one is important to many right now.
1461 2018-09-05 16:14:56 All eyes on how stocks in the US react to this risk on move after weakness this morning on EM worries..
1462 2018-09-05 16:14:55 Anyway right now is a great time to buy stocks in Nike
1463 2018-09-05 16:14:53 Rich people have stocks.

I need to get stocks.

That's business. I need to learn to business.
Then my money can profit.
...dividends?
1464 2018-09-05 16:14:46 All eyes on how stocks in the US react to this risk on move after weakness this morning on EM worries..
1465 2018-09-05 16:14:03 Nike is one of the few stocks going up today +0.40 $80 a share Why Lie
1466 2018-09-05 16:13:59 There is a general risk on move after the comments on Brexit as the USD falls and stocks rise..
1467 2018-09-05 16:13:56 ~Hurricane coming~ *stocks up on all the mango Juul pods I can get my hands on*
1468 2018-09-05 16:13:54 There is a general risk on move after the comments on Brexit as the USD falls and stocks rise..
1469 2018-09-05 16:13:17 Ça oscille d'année en année suivant plusieurs paramètres dont les aléas climatiques. C'est difficilement prévisible en terme de quantité. C'est les stocks qui permettent d'avoir un prix stable.
1470 2018-09-05 16:13:17 Its your choice, the Faceless one is still in the works. Im trying to get unique stocks and shit for that while this was just stuff I use on my Fortnite headers I make. This has been in the works for awhile.
1471 2018-09-05 16:12:42 Looks just like MSPC!  Lol
1472 2018-09-05 16:12:11 I told everybody to get some Nike stocks
1473 2018-09-05 16:12:05 Time to add good fundamentals stocks....#Bright Indian Growth Story with Positive Energy....may be next 10 to 15 years with many Billionaires from India# ...
Its time to think Positive and Only Positive ....
1474 2018-09-05 16:11:46 And with that said... the white flag is up.
1475 2018-09-05 16:11:40 Thinking about getting into stocks. 
1476 2018-09-05 16:11:29 やっぱオーダイルの『おんがえし』が最高すぎる
1477 2018-09-05 16:11:11 u could have bought $AMD at 26.84 today...when it was in panic freewill...what a gift!  same as> i bought $SQ at 85 ish =buy the strongest stocks as they are #TANKING/ #CRASHING  there the fist to bounce back...this is hardly the end...
1478 2018-09-05 16:11:10 Come on bud, list some stocks that you are invested in that made you a ton of money under Trump...
1479 2018-09-05 16:10:32 Someone tell me how to buy stocks plz!!
1480 2018-09-05 16:10:28 It’s time to buy some nike stocks before it go back up 
1481 2018-09-05 16:09:58 Seems plausible if NiKe was private comp but I believe a CEO of public corp must have approval by Board of Directors 1st. BOD safeguard stock holders from crazy CEO's. Stocks r critical to any legit corp. so that is the conundrum. Are they shorting their stocks 4 personal gains?
1482 2018-09-05 16:09:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1483 2018-09-05 16:08:49 People forget that stocks dont equal profit and stocks have more to do with projection of markets than they ever will the profit and sales of a company.
1484 2018-09-05 16:08:48 #FMCG #stocks seeing good amount of profit booking

It will be good to see when investors start buying them again

1485 2018-09-05 16:08:38 Confuses AUM with trading volume and better to discuss % ownership in largest 100 stocks in US market (free float) to remove coy ownership.
1486 2018-09-05 16:08:27 I like that idea, but I live in a deep red state and I'd probably get doors slammed in my face, followed by being put in the stocks and pummeled with overripe tomatoes!
1487 2018-09-05 16:08:26 man who can teach me somethin about stocks & investments?? i’m tryna run it up dawg..
1488 2018-09-05 16:08:02 En dias asi té encima!!! Pero tienes q pensar rápido y aprovechar estos movimientos!!!
1489 2018-09-05 16:07:39 Nike stocks are up today, but don’t let facts cloud your delusions.
1490 2018-09-05 16:07:28 More fake news, Donnie. Nike’s stocks went UP following the Kap announcement.

But then again, I’m telling this to someone who only knows two business practices:
1. Scam it.
2. Bankrupt it.

#StableGenius #DonTheCon
1491 2018-09-05 16:07:20 Am hearing crickets right now, nothing to say with the stocks climbing back. Seems like the rest are still down, what happened Clay.
1492 2018-09-05 16:07:14 Many people ask what's the best thing to invest in while thinking of stocks, cryptos, gold, etc.  However too many of them miss the best opportunity, which is yourself! 
1493 2018-09-05 16:06:40 أجيليتي مقاومة.  ٨٥٨ -٨٦٧-٨٧٩.    دعم ٨٤٠-٨٣٤-٨٢٨-٨١٨
1494 2018-09-05 16:06:38 Limpieza de manos débiles!!!  en estas situaciones es donde se pone a prueba los sistemas de inversión  ¿Eres mano fuerte o carne de cañón??? 
1495 2018-09-05 16:06:26 Maybe one does not have in depth knowledge of the stock market.... As it goes it's not so hard to understand a companies yearly stocks highs and lows and Nikes lowest was between June and August, it actually closed higher today than them 2 months. A 10 years old can work a chart
1496 2018-09-05 16:06:15 But I was talking about all stocks if you look back at my first tweet to you so 
1497 2018-09-05 16:06:12 Shareholders dropped Nike like a hot potato and stocks plunged. Maybe they should of taken more time to research where the bacon is really coming from. Consumers please do your research and swish to another brand.
1498 2018-09-05 16:06:10 This love fest will last forever with some because it's not about stocks or jobs. It's about the skin color.
1499 2018-09-05 16:06:07 Yeh, stocks lost 4 billion, great deal nike, BRAAAAAHAAAAAHAAHAHAHA!
1500 2018-09-05 16:05:52 This is why these bad guys dropped the stocks today.

Regulate them and restore the freedom of speech. 

Great job, Senator. 
1501 2018-09-05 16:05:34 Yes @KeithOlbermann, you suck at sports too just like your debut as announcer for baseball game that everyone hated. But stocks don't take a massive nose dive either for no reason.
1502 2018-09-05 16:05:33 Definitely need to look in Nike stocks today.
1503 2018-09-05 16:04:47 Just for the record NIKE stock isn’t dropping. Don’t just buy stocks on what you hear. Do the research. Listen to quarterly earnings calls, see how much reserved money they have, go back and read news from at least 3 years ago. Don’t trust anyone else’s information but your own!
1504 2018-09-05 16:04:43 With that being said, putting Colin on the front of the campaign was genius. Nike gets 2 thumbs up for me. Their stocks are going BRAZY right now, because of the profit they’re making off his face.
1505 2018-09-05 16:03:58 I need a chest freezer. A place to keep my stocks, etc.

1511 2018-09-05 16:03:02 Nike stocks gonna be just fine! Black people got Nike's back and we got the spending power!

1513 2018-09-05 16:02:43 Need to find out how to invest in some nike stocks while all this boycotting is dropping the price cause the bounce back is going to be major
1514 2018-09-05 16:02:17 Need to find out how to but me some Nike stocks for this drop that’s coming cause the bounce back gone be major
1515 2018-09-05 16:02:14 Now is the time to buy Nike stocks y’all 
1516 2018-09-05 16:02:05 Yes... as of yesterday. Just like other controversial big news effects stocks that day. If it’s still down 3.8% in a few months this may have longer lasting effects. And can you please stop w the lavar burton gif... LOL!
1517 2018-09-05 16:01:52 You're trying to get attention bringing up the long term of the stock that everybody knows isn't failing. We're joking about them dropping due to SJW donations, but it did take a nice hit for a day..$2 less in stocks for just a day is millions of $$ lost, even if it's only 1 day
1518 2018-09-05 16:01:13 “LMAO NIKE STOCKS FAILING. THEY LOST $4B! DOWN $3 AT THE OPEN”

1) It’s 3% of their market cap
2) Any news can cause a stock to dip (Apple’s stock went down 5% when their Face ID didn’t work)
3) LONGGGGGGG
1519 2018-09-05 16:01:03 My little brother just texted me to talk about investing and buying stocks, lmao whaaatttt

1521 2018-09-05 16:00:49 Nike’s stocks falling after making Kap face of new ad? Weird
1522 2018-09-05 16:00:46 Also currently the state of the situation is that people don't like this and Nike stocks are dropping. They've lost 4 billion (as of yesterday) in stocks so far. Argument ensues about what impact this will have when all is said and done.
1523 2018-09-05 16:00:41 Sir do you think that the current rise in Nifty/Sensex is due to the rise in few stocks that command heavy weightage in the index(such as HDFC,TCS, etc etc.) Whereas majority of the underweight stocks have fallen?
1524 2018-09-05 16:00:21 We gotta take about these stocks and crypto.
1525 2018-09-05 16:00:11 After a month of trading this first major pullback made me write down my rules and post them above my monitors. Stopped out of all but two of my stocks.
1526 2018-09-05 16:00:02 Unfortunately, A lot of y’all can’t afford to purchase multiple stock in Nike to see significant gain. So cut that out. 

It’s always the people who don’t know a thing about stocks talking about investing.
1527 2018-09-05 15:59:50 You sign up on E*TRADE and then there’s tutorials on how to buy etc I invested my money first and then started buying certain stocks it’s a limbo at first but once u start you’ll be fascinated by it. I’m still learning tho lol
1528 2018-09-05 15:59:45 Since they manufacture outside of US and were going to get hit by tarriffs, why didn’t they forget the huge media campaign with their new spokesperson and use all that losing in stocks etc into transitioning back to America manufacturing?  They wouldn’t need to pay anyone.
1529 2018-09-05 15:59:39 Bout to buy some nike stocks now so when they shoot back up in a week when no one gives a shit I’ll make a lil cash hopefully
1530 2018-09-05 15:59:00 I fucking absolutely loves stocks 
1531 2018-09-05 15:58:54 Would like to hear some financial numbers with hopefully net profit for meta and auxly..big loosers for the moment.strange..very strange that there still is no rally about these 2 stocks
1532 2018-09-05 15:58:52 A 46year old CEO is betting over $44 billion in 1 stock that will skyrocket in the future. He predicted the rise of other stocks such as Netflix & Amazon before everyone else saw the rise also.

Nobody knows his name, but he was last seen passing an almanac to Old Biff Tannen.
1533 2018-09-05 15:58:35 "These uncouth individuals ought to be placed in stocks!!!" Mike Huckabee screams while dressed as a 17th century aristocrat
1534 2018-09-05 15:58:25 people are posting pics of nike stocks that went down saying “see nike didnt know what they were doing”. 1. you don’t understand the stock market. 2. it goes up and down all the time. 3. adidas also went down so it could have been pure coincidence, 4. it went back up today 
1535 2018-09-05 15:58:12 haha, maybe. though there could be some interesting though politically useless posturing which get turned into memes. everyone cares about their meme stocks
1536 2018-09-05 15:57:43 Good question to ask right about now, how many regular hard working people own Nike Stocks? The stock might be losing value but I bet you Nike will never lose a dime, if anything they will gain more in the long run..People say the DOW is up, up for whom? That’s the 1% problem...

1539 2018-09-05 15:56:58 Niggas crazy lol. Talkin bout buying Nike stocks. Nike is $80 a share. How many shares y’all plan on buying? When? And how much you think it’s gonna go up? And how soon? Y’all Niggas gon profit $50-$60 maybe, relax

1596 2018-09-05 15:42:30 Stop trying to explain the stock market to these idiot Trump supporters. Nike is up $27 dollars YTD. Taking profits off the table is what smart investors do for whatever reason. Clay doesn't understand you buy stocks to make money. Investors locked in some profits yesterday.

1650 2018-09-05 15:29:10 @AskRobinhood 2 months back, I transf'rd stocks from RH to other brokerage. My cost bases shot up by 5-10%. It's misleading to buy comm'n free & have cost shoot up when transf'rd away. My ticket is sitting open with no concrete response since long. What do I do? #Robinhood $JPM
1651 2018-09-05 15:28:56 I just see them doing a lot of work to make cases that don't work out over any meaningfully long period of time, and I just want fundamental analysis and judgment to find mis-priced stocks, so we're on different paths.

1653 2018-09-05 15:28:13 Ian woke me up @ 2 am last night just to talk about stocks I hate him
1654 2018-09-05 15:28:03 if nike stocks still low next week im grabbing some fuck that
1655 2018-09-05 15:27:57 Stocks are up Donny pay attention. Who do you think spends more money, young adults or frugal old racists? I'm sure Nike will make it.
1656 2018-09-05 15:27:56 It’s a marketing trick watch the stocks a week or 2 from now !
1657 2018-09-05 15:27:33 True!! But also right about now people are investing in Nike stocks so they can cash out on the big boom that’s going to happen in their stocks in about a month or so. It’s a top sale product. Like Chick fil a plummeted over lgbt and now you can’t ever find an empty chick fil a.
1658 2018-09-05 15:27:18 Mexico has created a marine reserve large than Greece to help protect wildlife. The reserve will have all fishing and hotel developments banned in the area. The aim is to help replenish fish stocks and save animals like the Vaquita, of which there are only dozens left.
1659 2018-09-05 15:27:16 Went out to buy a mouse, i went to the first market to find out they r out of stocks then go to another and find nothing then to the third to also see them out of stock then go to the shop next to the first market and they dont have any aswell
And finally i find one but it closed
1660 2018-09-05 15:27:07 I am scared that will spiderman ps4 be able to release on 7th sep in India because where I live stocks haven't reached yet..! @insomniacgames @bryanintihar
1661 2018-09-05 15:27:03 Um @realDonaldTrump @NFL ratings were dropping wayy before that incident, Due to CTE diagnosis from  players in the league and I’m @nike stocks will eventually climb back up. How are you president again?

1665 2018-09-05 15:26:14 Bristol City Councillors and the Mayor continue to be laughing stocks. Farcical decisions as ever. The arena should have been opened by now and have put Bristol City Centre on the map. Arena on the scrap heap much like the well vaunted tram system.
1666 2018-09-05 15:26:07 Anything can happen at any moment with this stock 
1667 2018-09-05 15:26:01 On the other hand I definitely would look into emerging market (foreign) stocks. China Brazil Russia Thailand. Have been going down since 08. Now is the time to make money there
1668 2018-09-05 15:25:57 I need to take a stocks & bonds course so I can get my head in the investment game fr.

1672 2018-09-05 15:24:42 Anytime there’s a boycott on something that Trump doesn’t like, you see their stocks initially drop. But then they go way up. Literally look at Nordstrom haha. Nows the time to buy Nike stock.
1673 2018-09-05 15:24:40 The tax cut is a trap, because Trump did it to benefit  himself and his family, and give 20% tax cuts to the rich who are 1% of the American people, who invest that 20% in buying stocks .
Mr. Besos said, Donald Trump make me richer than i was before.

I followed your advice for icici and you were right about that.

Thanks!
1677 2018-09-05 15:24:14 Thank you for the nibble have a fantastic Wednesday evening. Thought you were better than that Mr Stocks

1682 2018-09-05 15:22:55 Today is a good day to buy stocks I just wish a had the money
1683 2018-09-05 15:22:20 I kinda wanna buy Nike stocks since they dropped
1684 2018-09-05 15:22:11 Hey bro. Stocks is good but Forex moves much faster and is worth looking into as well. If you are willing to learn it and even get into Binary Options it can be a very profitable option for you and give you a great return on investment.
1685 2018-09-05 15:22:04 Keep burning Nikes so stocks go down lol. Time to invest!

1688 2018-09-05 15:21:34 Yet again...people love saying stocks have anything to do with actual American citizens. They'll be fine.
1689 2018-09-05 15:21:32 But the stocks did plummet tho
1690 2018-09-05 15:21:08 Market averages like $SPY, $IWM, $QQQ while good aggregators, are not leading indicators. By definition they are lagging momentum stocks.
1691 2018-09-05 15:21:06 To everyone complaining about the Nike Kapernick ad.The company has already lost out on stocks and key investors. If you really think the company will drop an ad campaign video and risk their market more, you’re wrong.
1692 2018-09-05 15:20:56 Hi! We're sorry so many things went wrong in one trip. We'll share your concerns about the lack of carts, out of stocks, long checkout lines, the absence of the self checkout attendant and broken card readers at the Finneytown Kroger with our leadership team.
1693 2018-09-05 15:20:50 I'm not talking about that I'm talking about the decline in sales and stocks Nike has had. It was happening before the Ad came out, and my store has walls full of Nike while weve been selling out of Adidas for over a month consistantly

1700 2018-09-05 15:19:49 Exactly, I'm loving all these hot takes on how to "fix" the cup series that are essentially "run the $200 purse street stocks", or replicate ARCA, which just sold for pennies on the dollar to NASCAR/ISC.
1701 2018-09-05 15:19:48 Nike stocks will rise now that Trump is outraged by what he started a long time ago its called anti- biases based on color, culture, social economics, and education #NikestockWillRise

1709 2018-09-05 15:18:00 fucking stocks. 
1710 2018-09-05 15:17:57 A pullback in the Nasdaq..but, many of the industrial, food, bank stocks holding up....just looks like profit taking to me...which is healthy...
1711 2018-09-05 15:17:47 Sarah, lives on Santa Trabuco with too many cats.

Put all their savings into mango stocks. Can't retire.
1712 2018-09-05 15:17:46 So is this just a maniputation of your stocks. Sell your stocks. Watch them go down.  Buy back stock at low. Get rid of Kaepernick do to public outrage. Watch stocks go back up. Insider trading?
1713 2018-09-05 15:17:36 Nike calculated WRONG.  People are speaking an stocks plummet! What has Karpernick done since? Has he organized teams & players to go to inner cities he claims to care about and talk to and work with Police, volunteer? Talk is CHEAT! 

NIKE should have used real heros, VETS!
1714 2018-09-05 15:17:29 The smash bros ruleset evolved in a vacuum compared to other fighting games, and chose what they felt made sense. Even Smash 4 players aren't so happy with 2 stocks is the impression I get, but it takes so long to kill in that game, they don't really have a choice.

1717 2018-09-05 15:16:35 The stock market has been pumped with stimulus and 1% interest rate money since 08 resulting in these all time high prices of stocks. Interest rates (set by the Fed) have to go up to control inflation resulting in these dramatic drops. Not any of the headlines u see
1718 2018-09-05 15:16:32 Reading some UT investment tips, mentioned of technical analysis to enter at low price. Seriously, how do u guys do that? No such thing of TA in UT investment. It is not a demand vs supply like stocks.

1720 2018-09-05 15:16:20 Some stocks went down today and other stocks went up or are unchanged. The Nasdaq declined since it does that sometimes. On other days it is up or or flat.

1723 2018-09-05 15:15:58 As a retired nurse I have seen incidents where there have been shortages and emergency stocks brought in from the EU on special orders that increase the cost. After brexit these costs will increase and there will be further custom delays..this could make the insulin unusable.
1724 2018-09-05 15:15:55 If momentum stocks are a leading indicator (I believe they are) - 34 SL50 stocks are down > 2% so far today vs only one up more than 2%
1725 2018-09-05 15:15:34 Hahaha, I can stand my ground forever I have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. I'm curious on how many billions Nike will lose before they cave?!?! We are LMFAO while watching the stocks drop! While Nike dismisses the true HEROES in America!! Our real Super Heroes!!
1726 2018-09-05 15:15:33 What I did was use my @Fidelity trading platform and picked up some stock yesterday morning. That’s what I use to buy/sell stocks

1732 2018-09-05 15:14:24 2 stocks is crazy volatile in my opinion, and unlike other games, percentage building up is kind of a slippery slope factor. Smash 4 needs to be played with 2 stocks, because any more and they'd risk more timeouts despite the 8 minute timer.

1747 2018-09-05 15:11:49 Stocks tried to push into the green, but have fallen back into negative territory.
1748 2018-09-05 15:11:38 better get your nike stocks NOW.
1749 2018-09-05 15:11:27 Adidas and Puma dropped too all 3 shoe companies had 2% drop their shares haven't dropped and Nike cares about long term trends they're not looking at stocks week to week.
1750 2018-09-05 15:11:05 Twitter down 4.42% today. Netflix down 5.11% Facebook still falling to $165 a share from $220. Nike and all stocks are overpriced trust that. Load up, stocks are goin to get real cheap soon.

1763 2018-09-05 15:08:55 Wow, you don’t understand stocks at all?  #puma #adidas #reebok and #kswiss we’re all down the same percentage. Did they ALL hire #Kaep?
1764 2018-09-05 15:08:23 Maize being a political crop, Malawi has enough stocks but going through the villages, you still get pockets of shortages & abundance. If market was to be allowed to work normally, there could be no issues of hunger but we love creating a crisis where not necessary.
1765 2018-09-05 15:08:13 OMG one of my stocks is down 3.2 % today. Must be a boycott because it certainly can't be market fluctuations.
1766 2018-09-05 15:08:12 LOL it may have dipped a bit , but it also was a bad trading day in the market, Nike stock is almost back to where it was yesterday, thanks for the FUD to grab some cheap Nike stocks!

1770 2018-09-05 15:07:57 Thanks G. I’m tryna get into stocks
1771 2018-09-05 15:07:55 Invested a lot of money into stocks last year and now it doubled

1773 2018-09-05 15:07:38 FAANNG type stocks getting slapped today. We’ll cover the big names & levels in the Mid-Week Review tonight.
1774 2018-09-05 15:07:18 @nike is a well known brand and they have business all around the world. So i really doubt their stocks are gonna fall. Most Americans and the world hates u. So if nike goes against ur bigotry, honey, trust me - nike and colin will prevail. Not even ur cult can affect their game.
1775 2018-09-05 15:07:16 Frank you're usually good but you're off on this one. All comparable stocks fell yesterday, it was not an isolated situation.
1776 2018-09-05 15:07:16 Misleading. They earn huge from stocks & shares.
1777 2018-09-05 15:07:09 A lot of stocks are dipping. Just thought I’d let y’all know
1778 2018-09-05 15:07:02 Who knows a lot about stocks? I got mad questions? Y’all put me on game.
1779 2018-09-05 15:06:08 On HLN they said NFL & Nike are such big CO'S they can take a hit & still survive. News said Nike lost billions & stocks R down. They claimed most of Nike sales come from foreign countries & this is why they stuck their necks out & went against Conservatives!
1780 2018-09-05 15:05:51 What are some good stocks to invest in?
1781 2018-09-05 15:05:45 Nike didn’t fall 3%. My point being other stocks fell more. Nike is back up today. Adidas and Puma fell yesterday, which is 40% of athlete endorsed athletic shoes I can think of. Just leaves out Reebok and UA (I don’t count sketchers although Howie Long does endorse).
1782 2018-09-05 15:05:16 All tech stocks are down.
1783 2018-09-05 15:05:11 Easiest way to identify the guy who doesn’t understand how stocks work, is the guy boasting about prices before noon.
1784 2018-09-05 15:04:23 Its probably because I’m a girl and I fuck heavily with Ulta stock and makeup retailers lol. I shop a lot so I guess I’m more inclined to deal with retailers . Weed stocks are my next move, is there anything popping going on with cannabis 
1785 2018-09-05 15:04:08 Dude just let it go... you gonna keep us updated on Nike stocks eveyday or only when they are up ?
1786 2018-09-05 15:03:38 Could you imagine how the stocks would soar, if they were to have done that.
1787 2018-09-05 15:03:28 If you are a smart man buy Nike stocks rn. Their stock only plummeted because of instant reaction. Nike is a powerhouse who will rebound quickly.
1788 2018-09-05 15:03:24 Check their stocks vs their competitors. Nike up. UA and Adidas down. Cool protest. It worked for 12 hours. You know Nike is run by smart people, right? Your fake outrage would spark an equal and greater reaction into their hands. The Nike demographic is 35 and under.
1789 2018-09-05 15:03:19 @SquawkStreet @carlquintanilla @SaraEisen @CourtReagan So far, #SenateHearing seems unlikely to result in any further actions that $FB, $TWTR are not already doing, so the stocks will rebound afterwards. Only the last senator before 1st break asked a difficult question
1790 2018-09-05 15:03:17 Y’all copped them Nike Stocks right?
1791 2018-09-05 15:03:06 Their stocks plummeted.
1792 2018-09-05 15:02:26 @BrettKavanaugh @MeTooMVMT #SchoolSafety #shooting #parenting Today he based a ruling on AR-15 common use, also “Automatic weapons cannot be legal.”NRA members, Vets can change AR-15 to a machine gun easy. Bump stocks, or change lower reciever
1793 2018-09-05 15:02:05 Yooo I posted an article on weed stocks, what are you looking at ? I'm keen to jump on a few
1794 2018-09-05 15:01:51 First of all, it's good to know there is a whole community of people out there watching uranium stocks like I am. And second, thank you all for sharing your insights, .@renegadestyle, .@hammerinvesting, .@cannonball1246, .@TBirdV, .@Juanmaeee, .@BrentBrickman & more

1810 2018-09-05 14:58:08 BUY NIKE STOCKS!
1811 2018-09-05 14:58:03 Need to buy some Nike stocks ASAP
1812 2018-09-05 14:58:02 Y’all are CRAZY if you think Nike didn’t do extensive market research & case studies before launching the campaign. They knew their stocks would plummet AND they were prepared. Watch the stock start back rising. 
1813 2018-09-05 14:57:48 I know things look good from your perspective, but I'm not looking at the stock market. It's a fine thing if you have a portfolio, but the majority of Americans can't afford to gamble in stocks. Corporate interests are not my thing. I'm looking at the differences. Next tweet
1814 2018-09-05 14:57:34 “Shoe stock declines due to Kap campaign” what a lazy narrative. They would of declined anyway. Just like every other stock out there. That’s what stocks do. But who am I get ya clickbait
1815 2018-09-05 14:57:04 if you mean what do I think of the stock AMD, I don't have any opinion on high priced stocks.

1867 2018-09-05 14:46:15 Nike dipped 2.5% and Adidas dipped 2.4%...it was post labor day, nothing to do with an ad campaign. Stocks aren't going to go up or down based on an ad campaign typically anyway unless the campaign affects sales positively or negatively.

1895 2018-09-05 14:40:04 That is Nike take one. Now they have take two>the shoes! They must b targeting d younger generation where most parents still supporting their kids in school.

1928 2018-09-05 14:34:26 #Nike STOCKS SOAR in the Youth and Urban Community

#BoycottNike Backfired in a Major Way
1929 2018-09-05 14:34:05 Watch the Nike stocks...this ought to interesting. It would have been a much better campaign to put Pat Timman’s face up there with that same tag line.
1930 2018-09-05 14:33:38 I can’t believe that Nike picked him. I just read they are already down in the stocks so maybe they thought what the hey....my state is ugly blueOregon. Soros money behind Gov. Kate Socialist Brown. Nike started here.
1931 2018-09-05 14:33:17 I have a feeling that stocks might drop very soon, and all that money will go to cryptos! Only two projects with actual longterm value based on economic models are BTC and BNB.
1932 2018-09-05 14:33:09 My husband builds them for us. He calls them his lego guns. He likes to wait for the big sales and then "stocks up" on parts.
1933 2018-09-05 14:32:57 Make sure you #invest an take ownership into @Nike stock and shop!! The stocks will be back up very soon...Since they're releasing new Jordan's next week  #ImWithKap #Nike #ownership #stock
1934 2018-09-05 14:32:47 “When women of the town are become dealers of stocks at the same time some good natured gentlemen have quitted them, it is high time to pronounce it truly a FARCE”
1935 2018-09-05 14:32:19 #Justdontdoit
No more Nike! Stocks continue to fall! If you own any, you might consider dumping them! Apparel as well as stocks!
1936 2018-09-05 14:32:13 Just when I think certain stocks can’t go lower, they do. #Humbling #Frustrating #Learning #Stocks
1937 2018-09-05 14:32:09 And Nike stocks plummet. LOL
1938 2018-09-05 14:32:00 Now the tariffs would hurt them & maybe it has already. That is probably why stocks were taking a hit. My local news instead was making it sound like a handful of ppl were hurting an international company with the dip in the stock market. Lol
1939 2018-09-05 14:31:59 #Nike STOCKS SOAR in the Urban Community as they Support @Kaepernick7  and the fight #Justice

1940 2018-09-05 14:31:57 looks like the bear market in stocks has just begun!!
1941 2018-09-05 14:31:51 I sold off stocks.   #boycottnike #BoycottNikeJustDoIt #BoycottKaepernick
1942 2018-09-05 14:31:49 @facebook #Sandberg & @Twitter #Dorsey lying thru their teeth on Capitol Hill ... & their stocks are tankng! Way to go fools!!
1943 2018-09-05 14:31:42 Many strong stocks not showing the kind of resilience I would have expected. When trading aggressive momentum stuff that is slightly going parabolic, I let myself stop out very quickly when a stock shows signs of weakness.

1949 2018-09-05 14:30:45 52-week highs and lows 

However, 20 stocks, including Tech Mahindra, Alembic  Pharmaceuticals, Cantabil Retail India and Electrosteel Steels, hit  52-week highs on NSE.
1950 2018-09-05 14:30:37 Nike dropped 3% after the campaign. Obviously when you buy stocks you sit down with a financial advisor/broker. Buy low sell high is a motto for “safe” stocks like McDonald or Walmart. Even when they have controversies and PLUMMET, they always pick back up.
1951 2018-09-05 14:30:34 52-week highs and lows 
As many as 107 stocks, including HPCL, BPCL, BEL, Idea Cellular, Tata Communications, Unitech and InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) hit 52-week lows on NSE.
1952 2018-09-05 14:30:31 That’s what I’m sayin lol I might be 60 when I can get it but I’ll be rich af and have something to hand down. But as long as the solid stocks keep going up I’ll have some petty cash round the 40s

1956 2018-09-05 14:29:58 Exactly - which is why I don't bother tracking it monthly.  Just as people give the advice of not checking your stocks every day.  Minute sways don't mean anything in the overall path.  Volatility is always higher in short time frames.
1957 2018-09-05 14:29:57 Nike stocks fell. Whoop, time to buy more shares .
1958 2018-09-05 14:29:52 So should I invest in anime stocks now ?
1959 2018-09-05 14:29:48 Plus these more conservative sectors have nowhere near the downside risk of overhyped & overowned tech names we hear about every 5 minutes elsewhere. This late in the economic/market cycle, they're the kinds of stocks investors should be focusing on IMO
1960 2018-09-05 14:29:33 Most stocks are down because of your enormous trade deficit (can you mess this up any more?) but Nike is up.

Congrats.
1961 2018-09-05 14:29:26 coat hanger stocks just went up. shady characters are now checking out many of america’s back alleys.
1962 2018-09-05 14:29:13 Now's the time to buy Nike stocks!
1963 2018-09-05 14:29:07 im out .. two small losses for me today...  my entire watchlist turned red of 50 stocks I was watching.. good day to leave the command center... ill be back tomorrow see what gets cooking
1964 2018-09-05 14:29:05 Chart TA isn’t used for stocks anymore except in fringe circles. Crypto is basically the only asset class where it’s not a joke to be a chartist primarily. Charts still hold info in crypto for a variety of reasons.
1965 2018-09-05 14:28:58 stocks are cool.

1969 2018-09-05 14:27:41 So now everyone is an expert in stocks.
1970 2018-09-05 14:27:33 Stocks took a nose dive? Higher than a month ago, 6 months ago and up again this morning....yep huge nose dive lol
1971 2018-09-05 14:27:25 when stocks go down, amateurs sell, professionals buy. descendants spending dividends from stocks purchased by their "families" 1930ish
1972 2018-09-05 14:27:20 Indeed. Inflation doubled, stocks finally collapsed and the economy hit the skids. URate went from sub 4 to 6+ (that’s a lot of workers!) Gspan also enjoyed a unique uptick in productivity and again, a political constellation that had sane fiscal policy.  #Itsdifferentthistime
1973 2018-09-05 14:27:10 it's funny markets turned green on brexit news after one of the worst days for global stocks bc of contagion. no stopping contagion now, US markets are a ticking time bomb
1974 2018-09-05 14:27:07 Nike forgot that it’s people that work who had stocks pulled from them.

1983 2018-09-05 14:26:05 why ? us stocks are so cheap
1984 2018-09-05 14:25:45 I’m not takin talking value % on stock Eric. Jesus. When you invest in stocks you look at more than price

1987 2018-09-05 14:25:34 Can’t govern well? Where have you been? Middle working class is better off than it’s been in decades. Black, Hispanic, and female unemployment is at lowest. Stocks are sustaining record highs. Other countries are respecting us again.
1988 2018-09-05 14:25:34 Funny, but if you read any of my work over the last few months, you'd see I never advocated 100% cash. I said I went to my highest cash % in years (approx. 40%) & I suggested shifting most of remaining $$ into "Safe Money" stocks in sectors like utes, consumer staples, and REITs
1989 2018-09-05 14:25:26 Yes. *stocks up on N95 masks and nitrile gloves*

1991 2018-09-05 14:25:06 I'm a gun owner and 2A supporter who wears wranglers, burnt my Nikes and wear skechers now. Fuck Levi's and Nike. When their stocks fall they will see how stupid their actions truely are
1992 2018-09-05 14:24:55 I don’t understand stocks. Y’all saying Nike is $80 a share. How many shares do i buy to make some bread?
1993 2018-09-05 14:24:38 Invest in stocks guys
1994 2018-09-05 14:24:34 Such harmful Chinese stocks of JD should be kicked out. Let them play around in A shares and Hong Kong shares.
1995 2018-09-05 14:24:20 Nike stock is about $79 right now, and it has dropped, but it’s definitely going to pick back up. Like when I bought amazon shares at $1200 a share and now they’re $2600 even after their controversies. You’re getting to technical as if I’m buying $100,000 worth of stocks.
1996 2018-09-05 14:24:19 And now cannabis stocks are selling off hard. Crazy market.
1997 2018-09-05 14:24:10 Up to about a week ago I was relaxed and cool about the market for mining stocks. Because I was still buying. How dare it not start to rise strongly immediately now I'm fully bought in! Disgusting!
1998 2018-09-05 14:24:08 if you were to look at some of the stocks of the mutual fund companies, you'd be left wondering if mutual funds were in perpetual decline as ETFs take over...
1999 2018-09-05 14:24:04 $SNAP almost under 10 now
2000 2018-09-05 14:24:01 Oh, and that's the drop in market cap, not an actual drop in sales. You can elaborate on that after Nike's annual report is released, but concerned shareholders or traders speculating on Nike stocks are not indicators for the actual sales performance.
2001 2018-09-05 14:24:01 fully two thirds (40/60) of stocks in the $TSX #TSX60 are below the 50-day moving average...
2002 2018-09-05 14:23:58 Nike stocks go up. Thank you for the promotion!
2003 2018-09-05 14:23:52 i spy with my little eye lots of big "blue chip" $TSX stocks on the new 52-week low lists...
2004 2018-09-05 14:23:45 That is the reason I provided those data sheets. The moment I tell & people buy but they don't go up, everyone will start blaming me. My time horizon, buying strategy are different. But, quality stocks are easy to identify. If you pick the right sector, you will get right stocks.

May I suggest they diversify and buy stocks in Smith&Wesson?

2008 2018-09-05 14:23:08 Lmao. You all kill me with this. What stock you know doesn't take hit throughout the course of a month? Im not naive to think it there wasnt a miniscule hit due to people's ignorance. Stocks are always up and down.

Here's what's really gonna happen: Over the next few days, the stock's gonna dip a little bit, then Trump is gonna tweet about it, then it's gonna dip the most, but then, people are going to see that one of the most valuable stocks has dipped and BUY.

2063 2018-09-05 14:13:42 Finally a speed bump after stocks broke out a week+ ago.  Each time they sell them down though, there are waiting hands to buy them. Currencies and bonds are weak links for a larger selloff so that's what we have to keep our eyes on

2073 2018-09-05 14:11:41 Indices need to correct quite a bit. In addition to normal correction, rupee, crude, CAD deficit, data integrity are putting pressure on the stock markets.

2074 2018-09-05 14:11:38 Can that be said for all stocks?

2097 2018-09-05 14:07:32 A word to the wise, it is important to wait for the fat lady to sing before you leap. Stocks move up and down daily so to get a true picture look a the price over two weeks for an indication of the trend.

2105 2018-09-05 14:05:38 Absolute minor set back. People are selling stocks out of panic. Their numbers will be back up in the next month or so. Sometimes you pay the price for doing what is right and just.

2127 2018-09-05 14:02:02 Not how stocks work LOL. I also know 2.5% change in a daily stock change is beyond normal Amazon and apple are much larger and they experience same losses. It's not an amount where the anti Nike people can hang there hat on as a fatal loss for them.They're actually up a 1% today
2128 2018-09-05 14:01:33 @nike stocks went back up this morning. Adidas, Puma, and Under Armour are still down

2142 2018-09-05 13:59:21 I'm definitely not investing in Nike.  Stocks down 4 percent in just a couple days.

2147 2018-09-05 13:58:25 Stocks go up and down constantly based on rumor and public perception. We won't really know anything until Nike has to report 2018 Q4 sales and revenue figures, which will be interesting considering the holiday season coming up quickly.

My querry is how to short list the stocks for intraday trading
2158 2018-09-05 13:56:02 I'm really enjoying seeing this trend of company stocks tanking after the company goes overt political. It gives me hope that in the future, other companies might be deterred from inflammatory public political posturing. 
2159 2018-09-05 13:55:51 Me investing into stocks probably one of the best decision I’ve made
2160 2018-09-05 13:55:45 Tanginang inflation yan. Pasok niyo na pera niyo sa stocks para malabanan inflation
2161 2018-09-05 13:55:42 When you think about how much commodity companies were making then (I believe the driver of the > doubling from 2003 —> 2007) it does makes it less concerning (earnings ex tech way up since 2003). It raises question to me if technology stocks are classified correctly.
2162 2018-09-05 13:55:39 @GolicAndWingo Check Adidas & Puma stocks - It was more of a shoe market decline then Kolin influence

2166 2018-09-05 13:55:26 Lol. And? Their stocks will be fine and large families like my own will GLADLY continue to support them from dradt dodging morons like yourself chump drumpf. You find it hard to watch, follow, play, etc.... you're a fucking child. Everyday you prove this over and over.
2167 2018-09-05 13:55:24 Yeah... it’s the “is there such thing as bad press?” scenario, because either way people are talking about the brand. (Now the stocks dipped, so that’s another thing, but still.)
2168 2018-09-05 13:55:18 I hope there's another batch of stocks for it. A friend would love to order it, he is a big fan of you and Pete.
2169 2018-09-05 13:54:35 On a "positive" note. Elon reopened his opinion for Thailand's children sex trafficking issue and now my stocks plummeted

2173 2018-09-05 13:53:05 I will buy Nike  stocks today!
2174 2018-09-05 13:52:56 this won't make a dent  especially considering Nike is global and no one cares outside of a small portion of trump supporting Nike consumers. Nike's stocks are down today but so are their competitors'. This won't be news in 72 hours.
2175 2018-09-05 13:52:45 To the fan who suggested about buying sm stocks to give everything to snsd,

Let's do it.
2176 2018-09-05 13:52:33 Lol I'd like to learn stocks, always been curious about them and how they work
2177 2018-09-05 13:52:30 Wtf are you talking about? A classic pump n dump of their own stocks? Your theory is they made their own stock go down so they could sell it n make money? How does that work- r u assuming they were shorting the stock, bc your scenario guarantees lower market cap. Explain, pls.
2178 2018-09-05 13:52:29 Fuck I should buy Nike stocks right now

2181 2018-09-05 13:51:55 Yeah I read a few articles about Goldman and other institutions talking down on internet stocks. The market having a huge sell off and then while all that’s happening the institutions are buying behind the scenes at sale prices. This is nothing new for them. It’s a repeat.

2186 2018-09-05 13:51:22 Anyone open to owning French stocks needs to check out Inventiva $IVA. Especially if you've got a background in NASH or metabolic disease. They've got a pan-PPAR agonist pointed at scleroderma and NASH. Multiple ph2 reads in next 18 months - theirs and competitors vldating PPAR.
2187 2018-09-05 13:51:15 GAHHHHH keep your eyes on the stocks you're thinking buying!! Dammit i missed my window 
2188 2018-09-05 13:51:08 Ha ha your giving them free advertisement. All the people who said they will boycott dont even buy Nike's in the first place. The younger generation buys Nike's. Stocks will recover in a few days no biggy.
2189 2018-09-05 13:51:04 Everyone saying now is the time to invest in Nike...  Do you even stock and share? Maybe now is the time before it’s too late but shares are still $79+ 
Most apparel stocks are down right now tbh. 
Invest in some weed/ marijuana stocks they’re low and growing.
2190 2018-09-05 13:50:51 I had never known of him until you pointed him out, WTF!  If he isn't touting TSLA it's the marijuana stocks, good God that better not be a buy and hold portfolio huh?

2202 2018-09-05 13:49:04 There will be a nasty reversal in the parabolic moves of many stocks

2208 2018-09-05 13:48:23 Sir not technical but fundamental view pls,
2209 2018-09-05 13:46:49 I haven't tweeted a lot about Cannabis Stocks, but I have been long some this year. Just lightened up this morning. Normally I don't like to trade this early, and technically even RSI suggests there's more room to run, but the trader in me senses fevered pitch.
2210 2018-09-05 13:46:38 $PNAT 0.0107 (-23%)
2211 2018-09-05 13:46:23 I love the idea of the stock market. It's confusing at times as you say but awesome if you're patient. I've held stocks for a few years and most of my savings come from them. The past year I've been impatient and losing opportunities
2212 2018-09-05 13:46:13 Bout to invest in my first stocks today
2213 2018-09-05 13:46:03 @PhillyD so are you buying the stocks now?

2218 2018-09-05 13:45:46 Stocks go up and down all the time. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, etc have all experienced this at some point. Question is will it stay down. Remember last year one of the NFL's biggest selling jerseys was Kaepernick's.
2219 2018-09-05 13:45:33 I don’t understand charts
2220 2018-09-05 13:45:25 Market isn't down much but action in individual stocks not too hot today.
2221 2018-09-05 13:45:14 @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP @SenateDems  Tell the President to stop his Trade and Tariffs war. Three days of loses on the Stock market dollar is down, prices are up. China's currency is down, it's good for them not us. I'm tired of losing on stocks.
2222 2018-09-05 13:45:10 I agree with you on a lot of things, I agree with you on this one also LOL...

And before we focus on stocks the answer to all this lies with figuring out what is a low-market to book and high-market to book ratio firms, so this is balance sheet talk,
2223 2018-09-05 13:44:57 Tata Motors is forming a good base and it can move further up in the coming days .One can buy with positice bias.

Logic:  Stock is above 20 DMA & 50 DMA
            RSI is above 50 
            MACD is positive 
            Outperforming NIFTY in the short term
2224 2018-09-05 13:44:52 forget the september swoon. stocks will soar 5-10 percent by the end of the year . one wall street bull says
2225 2018-09-05 13:44:41 Or you can google the stocks and see the trends and that you’re wrong. But you’re right about one thing - it was a knee jerk reaction. Those are usually fleeting. 
2226 2018-09-05 13:44:41 South African #Platinum stocks going against general trend of falling mining shares.
No, it's not related to the ZAR otherwise S.A. #Gold shares would be up, too.
My take:  #hydrogen revolution - see also chart of Ballard Power...
2227 2018-09-05 13:44:32 Many Gold and Silver Miner stocks looks like they have completed measured moves from the July 5 highs.  $ ABX , $KL, $MAG are some examples. Action today not bearish
2228 2018-09-05 13:44:22 To be honest I don't know why Trump would brag about the economy.  Wages have not gone up, most Americans are paycheck to paycheck, and the only people getting richer have stocks which most Americans don't.  And if you look at Trump's popularity he's doing Jimmy Carter numbers.
2229 2018-09-05 13:44:20 Nike stocks are up this morning, so.... 
#JustDoIt
2230 2018-09-05 13:44:05 good morning to nikes stocks which are already recovering after one full day of barely feeling any effect from a bunch of racists burning shit they already purchased
2231 2018-09-05 13:43:57 PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE stocks slump
2232 2018-09-05 13:43:57 For those concerned about the fate of @Nike this would be a good time to buy stocks. Buy low, sell high. @Nike isn’t going anywhere.
2233 2018-09-05 13:43:32 Stocks ticked back up again after angry racists went out to buy more Nike shoes so they could burn them.
2234 2018-09-05 13:43:07 Brb buying @Nike stocks
2235 2018-09-05 13:43:02 LOL. U still have no clue about why and what they were protesting. You change the narrative and lie like a rug. Nike shares up 2.3%. Wish all my stocks were killed like that.
2236 2018-09-05 13:42:41 131). There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
2237 2018-09-05 13:42:34 PPT to the rescue!  Can'lt let market forces take stocks lower under any circumstances
2238 2018-09-05 13:42:26 now that im sure na legit kayo ... what if yung 100-200 stocks niyo ng army bomb ay di mo maorder hanggang sept 22 (since ayun po ang deadline niyo), magoopen po ba ulit kayo for new batch?
2239 2018-09-05 13:42:14 Also soaring stocks don't mean a thing for the two thirds of Americans who live paycheck to paycheck unless you believe in trickle down economics, in which case congratulations on living in 1981. Like most Republicans.

2241 2018-09-05 13:41:52 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
2242 2018-09-05 13:41:41 insane but understandable-these Canadian cos. listed in USA-acting as if they were the only Cannabis stocks out there, to a large extent. Blind momentum vs.some real value, of which VFFIF is prime example number 1 imo.
2243 2018-09-05 13:40:58 @CNBCFastMoney Remember the enthusiasm surrounding $INTC $MU and the energy stocks? Now, crickets.

2247 2018-09-05 13:40:27 Forget September swoon, stocks will soar 5-10% by the end of the year, says Wall Street bull ...
2248 2018-09-05 13:40:23 So was Adidas puma and footlocker, stocks rise and fall. Nike knows it's demographics. It's funny reading your tweets seeing how ignorant you are. And when someone provides facts you run and won't respond. That's why no one takes you serious
2249 2018-09-05 13:40:00 Does your advisor pick individual stocks for your portfolio?

There are pros that do literally NOTHING all day long but try to do this, and still can’t beat the market.

How is it your advisor is able to meet with you one-on-one AND still be able to manage your portfolio?
2250 2018-09-05 13:39:15 It’s nothing more than an inference though based on pure opinion. The only factual thing on stocks is gain or loss. Not how.
2251 2018-09-05 13:39:05 LOL Ross is your fund 150% pot stocks?
2252 2018-09-05 13:38:52 The American people are already speaking. Nearly 4 billion lost in stocks yesterday? Keep hitting ‘em where it hurts.
2253 2018-09-05 13:38:12 You can’t time the market, but September is a great month for new investors to get rid of their fear and get in! September is historically a bad month and a lot of stocks will drop. Time to buy in the dips! Let’s talk. #stockmarket @DaveRamsey #money #investing #finance

While Adidas opened down 

I guess Adidas must’ve signed Malcom X or something.

2266 2018-09-05 13:35:05 @Nike stocks still on the down?
2267 2018-09-05 13:35:04 @effectemergence when is a clean kill not a clean kill?  when t/a says so or when momentum can only carry the trade up to a certain point or when there is a sizable dip. case in point the rallying marijuana stocks.
2268 2018-09-05 13:35:02 I decided I'm going to invest however much it takes to own 10 stocks and every company that are like despite how they're doing for the year I want to own 10 chairs individually in each company that I have always like this is my goal for the end of the year 
2269 2018-09-05 13:34:57 You can also see, say, 40 stocks, 100 lakh. 2 stocks will total to 80 L. Rest will be losers, waiting for market price to catch up with purchase price.
2270 2018-09-05 13:34:30 I dont want to be anywhere near these platform stocks until this stuff cools down. It will be a tough month.

2294 2018-09-05 13:28:06 The power of the internet though. This stuff goes viral and encourages people to stop spending money with Nike. Go take a look at their stocks.

2322 2018-09-05 13:19:22 I think the stocks have peaked with top 5 (apple,amazon,google,fb,microsoft) being the sole reason for market stability. 2019 may be another 2009. and alternative asset crypto is at the bottom levels given it's hype. start accumulating. I'm starting this season with $ADC 10sats
2323 2018-09-05 13:19:16 Do you have a paycheck? Most Americans do ... they are bigger, less taxes.
Do you own stocks? 35% gains since Nov 2016. 
Do you have kids out of college? Never so easy to get a job.
Do you feel proud of America, our anthem, our flag, our values? I do!

2340 2018-09-05 13:16:29 Company like Samsung, LG, Lotte, Hyundai Department Store (Siwon's family company), CJ&M, SM, etc they all that had big impact for South Korea's economy. Big Hit is not even go public yet so they didn't have stocks for sell & buy in the capital market (korea exchange).
2341 2018-09-05 13:16:22 SEC had a decent # of Reg SHO enforcement actions a few years back but seems like less of a priority now.  Wonder if shorts being cannabis stocks changes draws their attention here.

2352 2018-09-05 13:14:20 Stocks go up and down. Nike didn’t do this on a whim. Give it more than a day. All of those shoe burners will buy Nike again next year. They always do.
2353 2018-09-05 13:14:19 @nike new ad campaign is successful.  Stocks down, people boycotting their products and paying the no good QB with 2 wins and 16 losses in 2016.   Love it when a plan comes together.  #maga #boycottNike #Nike
2354 2018-09-05 13:13:55 Whats the best app to invest in stocks with??
2355 2018-09-05 13:13:53 I guess my lack of interest is because I'm not all that active looking for new Stocks to buy. In usual years I'm buying and selling a lot more but this year I'm more a seller.
2356 2018-09-05 13:13:04 Too expensive to "lock them up". Use the public square for stocks for holding them for a week, then public flogging and fine sufficient to pay costs and reparations.  Corporal punishment reduces crime, incarceration increases crime through "crime schools" that prisons are.
2357 2018-09-05 13:12:56 Personally I use $DBC for my commodity exposure. I allocate 2%-5%. I also own commodity related stocks in mining, oil & gas, and materials.
2358 2018-09-05 13:12:53 Looking at $fb 170 puts this morning. Would like to see it come up to 172 before entering. #trading #investing #stocks #OptionsTrading

2360 2018-09-05 13:12:19 Just doubled the amount of stock I own, to two stocks. What a maverick. I’m coming for you Wall Street
2361 2018-09-05 13:12:19 Great point. My vote was anti Hillary 3fold. As a trader stocks would go up w/o a doubt. LesterHolt my fav journlst called her "Mrs Clinton" during debates not Sec of defense I thought its over thats her identifier forever, and she smiled way too much 4me re ISIS My bf died 9/11
2362 2018-09-05 13:11:59 Also, most people that buy Air Jordan’s don’t buy stock. You know who does buy stocks? Older white dudes. That’s what constitutes majority of Nike stock holders. * not including mutual funds that who knows what I own there.
2363 2018-09-05 13:11:56 Say goodbye to @Twitter stocks @jack
2364 2018-09-05 13:11:48 It’s hilarious watching people talk about Nike stocks plummeting for a day like they have ever bought stocks in their life. 
2365 2018-09-05 13:11:26 $XXII doing great also after it hit $2.25 .. had big volume yesterday... pot stocks are hot lately
2366 2018-09-05 13:10:14 true, but not enough of the racists have sold their stocks yet. it’s only gone down by $5 a share so far.
2367 2018-09-05 13:10:12 Proof that most polls are false. Their are a lot more pro Trumpers out there. Otherwise Nike stocks would be soaring.
2368 2018-09-05 13:09:53 September is traditionally a struggle for stocks and futures are indicating a down open today on what may just be seasonality.  Dow -100
2369 2018-09-05 13:09:52 Well, @nike stocks are up in the pre-market so I guess that #BoycottNike thing ain’t working out so well.
2370 2018-09-05 13:09:48 And to think that people dropped stocks on this news. Stupid.
2371 2018-09-05 13:09:43 #OTCQX stocks with news today: $WIKYY $VSQTF $EXPGY $RSHYY $CGOOF $ANXGF $PUBGY $ARREF $OTCM $BKDCF $TFECY $SPRWF $CORVF $TAOIF $MTAFF $CLLXF $AOTV $ARESF
2372 2018-09-05 13:09:42 Buy stocks are selected based on three things. 1:- high predicted returns based on Market price and accounts plus low debt 2:- Increasing revenues and incomes over the past 5 years 3:- decreasing incomes but increasing revenues equals a one off expense to recover from.
2373 2018-09-05 13:09:28 My anniversary gift is buying some Nike stocks! Just do it!!!!
2374 2018-09-05 13:09:27 I bought two shares of AMD stock a month ago that’s made me like 10$ and now I think I’m good at stocks
2375 2018-09-05 13:08:44 don't joke, May will order an air strike on his allotment shed to destroy alleged stocks of chlorine, that should put a spring in hubby's step when he's putting the bins out
2376 2018-09-05 13:08:43 @Nike stocks looks like it’s gonna be down on both knees today. Brilliant move Nike.  
2377 2018-09-05 13:08:41 Now these pot stocks feel like the crypto stocks late last year.
2378 2018-09-05 13:08:28 There are only two things that we know, Nike launched it's new campaign and stocks declined by nearly 4 billion dollars. If you have any solid info applicable to the connection between Nike's new campaign and its stock performance, I'm all ears.
2379 2018-09-05 13:07:57 Weed stocks are beasting! CRON TLRY CGG IGC. On watch today . Also NSU PRQR TRPX IFMK
2380 2018-09-05 13:07:55 The rout in emerging markets showed no sign of letting up, with most currencies weakening and an index of stocks nearing a bear market.South Africa’s rand led the sell-off, falling to the lowest level in more than two years, followed by Mexico’s peso.
2381 2018-09-05 13:07:51 Very true but there is a difference between normal market moves and contagion. When was the last time the US markets avoided a spillover in that type of scenario? Just saying I wouldn’t be invested in US stocks thinking we’re in the clear. There are risks.
2382 2018-09-05 13:07:47 Everyone is talking about how much money Nike lost but Despite the price plunge, Nike shares have risen ~27% in 2018. The company continues to be among the top performing Dow 30 stocks in 2018.
2383 2018-09-05 13:07:47 Stock notifications coming in saying stocks are up right now. Lemme go check this shit out..
2384 2018-09-05 13:07:47 True Doug...But Old Glory is killing Nike as well as kaepernick by way of the wallet because Nike's stocks R down and will continue on a down ward slide.  U don't have be violent just be smart and take your money somewhere else and spend it!

2391 2018-09-05 13:06:48 Saying you won't buy Nike.

2393 2018-09-05 13:06:33 I bet the SEC would approve TIDE, an ETF tracking stocks influenced by University of Alabama football.

2404 2018-09-05 13:04:10 Ang laki ng loss sa stocks ngayon 
2405 2018-09-05 13:04:04 Yes, but it mostly restricted stocks, only 920k is free trading.
2406 2018-09-05 13:04:02 Y’all be on here talking about don’t buy shoes, buy stocks. Y’all know how expensive a share is? Not to mention, you’re not going to see much of a return on one share of stock.
2407 2018-09-05 13:04:00 Russian business interests in the UK should suspend. Oligarchs money stored in London with mega purchases of real estate, stocks and simply bank accounts. UK confiscating all wealth will send a clear signal: If you work for Putin regime, you money not safe anywhere.
2408 2018-09-05 13:04:00 All stocks are cyclical, they've been higher and much lower, that's the market! They're not hurting! Time will tell!!
2409 2018-09-05 13:03:47 Try leaving your safe space some time. We have the best economy in 50 years, lowest unemployment, energy dominance, record stocks, more jobs then people looking. How is that being a "hazard?"
2410 2018-09-05 13:03:44 Strewth - that's just terrifying. You're probably right though because people fall bonkers in love with Stocks all the time and bet their house on it etc. Scary stuff  !!
2411 2018-09-05 13:03:32 Nike stocks are taking a knee
2412 2018-09-05 13:03:09 lmaooo for real. and the stocks on nike aren’t going down fast enough for me to risk investing, so there’s really nothing to gain from this 
2413 2018-09-05 13:02:48 Not according to their stocks. Lmao at you.
2414 2018-09-05 13:02:37 Thank you mate, you were so helpful can't thank you enough

2420 2018-09-05 13:01:30 Wait until their Stocks take a dip, a 20%+ loss will hurt stock holders .
2421 2018-09-05 13:01:05 There stocks would soar.

2424 2018-09-05 13:00:35 I think the judges just wanted to invest in some infra stocks !!
2425 2018-09-05 13:00:25 So do you sell all SA Inc stocks (just keep one or two for comfort like BVT, etc) and go into more rand hedges and some decent mining stocks. I agree problem structural and can only start to resolve one year after May next year.

2427 2018-09-05 13:00:01 A 401k they invest your money for you, like into bonds and stocks. So bonds are a little more secure less return but won't lose value. Stocks go up and down so your money can loose some value. I recommend putting 35% into bond the rest stocks.

2429 2018-09-05 12:59:45 An advice for beginner trader

Don’t use lv2 on listed stocks until you’re trying to short/buy a morning/afternoon spike

Too much manipulation going on the lv2

Use the chart, time and sales and basic support/resistance points
2430 2018-09-05 12:59:26 I’m sure it was a planned drop in stocks NIKE isn’t stupid
2431 2018-09-05 12:59:10 Bro I was seeing this most likely the portion can go up 5-7% I want to buy like 3 stocks 
2432 2018-09-05 12:59:04 Buys new pairs every year, but zero dollars in stocks and investment. You look like the wise one.
2433 2018-09-05 12:59:00 You’re thinking very much in your own tax bracket. Stocks go up and down. Typically much more than this. It’s what they do— and you don’t think Nike considered the risk before making the ad? They don’t give a shit, tony
2434 2018-09-05 12:58:38 I told you this winter there were twitter accounts who were either front running stocks-options or were actually being paid by brokers to create volume and of course I was right. SEC announced yesterday big investigation of highly followed social media accounts.

2438 2018-09-05 12:56:19 Nike has never dropped that far in one day in its history. Could be an anomaly and stocks are finicky
2439 2018-09-05 12:55:43 Yah, I thinking Nike's shoes are untied, oops! Did YOUR stocks fall down
2440 2018-09-05 12:55:24 Zukerberg lost 16 Billion in one day for being arrogant. I'm a nobody but I'm DONE with Nike I just bought $160 Nike Money sneakers wish I hadn't. As long as Nike endorses this idiot, I'm not supporting them in anyway shape or form. They'll care, I just sold some stocks Fri
2441 2018-09-05 12:55:18 Hey!  We are working on adding premarket charts, but in the meantime, the best approach is to watch my pre-market analysis and look at the levels I'm watching for the Gap and Go stocks.
2442 2018-09-05 12:55:14 Not an issue I’m focused on either way (I can see both sides).  As for stocks, you’re off here. When an industry leader is down, others in the industry often suffer short term while the market determines impact. Adidas and UA will be up over next couple of weeks. They r good buys
2443 2018-09-05 12:55:05 Brownies fused with D20 dice! WHILE STOCKS LAST!
2444 2018-09-05 12:54:57 how long will Nike live their little catch phrase with stocks dropping hope the go bankrupt
2445 2018-09-05 12:54:47 I’m waiting for the success story...successfully making us the laughing stocks of the world
2446 2018-09-05 12:54:40 A large percentage of Americans can't afford a $400 emergency, and you think it's reasonable that they should be gambling on stocks?
2447 2018-09-05 12:54:35 Yeah, but wouldn't that applies also to other licensed and cheaper stocks? Maybe like $CHV.c (I just picked random cheap one)
2448 2018-09-05 12:54:24 umm sweets, you need to learn how to either do math or how to read stocks. This is the truth
Adidas: -0.47%
Puma: -0.33%
Nike: -3.16%

2450 2018-09-05 12:53:32 SEC prob would argue QTUM merely a basket of stocks while bitcoin is a new, untamed asset class. Personally tho, I agree bitcoin ETF would work and should be approved. Also agree QTUM is not a pure play, lots of filler, kinda like Blockchain ETFs.
2451 2018-09-05 12:52:56 I have worn nothing but Under Armour for the last decade... glad I haven’t worn Nike in a long time!!! And never will again!! Send a message!! #BurnNike Sell the Stocks!! T

2463 2018-09-05 12:50:03 For someone who makes it well known he has a Vandy JD, you conveniently ignore that all shoe stocks went down to try and make the NIke decrease a bigger deal than it is.  However, you are rich from being a anti-left contrarian so I respect  that from my cube.

2476 2018-09-05 12:44:16 Would you consider them investors or friends that see these stocks/Bitcoin going up so fast that they want to just jump in whatever the price and think they will automatically make a buck. That’s what I was seeing with my friends last December/January
2477 2018-09-05 12:44:02 I swear all this has to do with big money selling short their stocks. It has to be no marketing department is this stupid. There is plenty of “safe” icons to use.. something to think about.
2478 2018-09-05 12:43:50 Lmao, our wedding about to be viral

2479 2018-09-05 12:43:22 Oil service stocks such as $SLB near YTD lows, and now $HAL comes out and says “downturn in activity more than expected” and “decrease in customer urgency creating price pressures”.  Yikes.
2480 2018-09-05 12:42:37 I just think watching back how stocks play out is incredibly helpful.  Better than spending £400 on a course lol

2485 2018-09-05 12:40:50 Great strategy! Stocks are plummeting! 
2486 2018-09-05 12:40:19 Will U.S. stocks catch DOWN to foreign markets? Or will foreign markets catch UP to the U.S.? The 1997-1998 analog suggests the former. But that was 20 years ago. Bulls will argue "This time is different." Hmm.  $INDU $QQQ $SPY
2487 2018-09-05 12:39:53 Yeah I know bro, they just took a gamble going publicly. And that shit hurting their stocks already
2488 2018-09-05 12:38:57 Everybody’s an “expert” on @Nike stocks like they were bitcoin last year. Foh

2495 2018-09-05 12:37:32 NOPE…will just move on to pot stocks
2496 2018-09-05 12:37:10 I think you're right. Still a few insane overvalued junky Stocks but I'm seeing a lot of Quality Long Term Stocks at very good prices. I noticed this morning how beat up #ECK has got - that could be a good buy at some point.
2497 2018-09-05 12:36:41 I met a chap who holds 55 stocks, the value of of his portfolio  was Rs 98 lakhs.

2504 2018-09-05 12:33:25 Nike definitely won’t go out of business, But just imagine the CEO’s and board of trustees face when they checked the stocks that morning 
2505 2018-09-05 12:32:51 Yeah that's my thinking. Little Black Book has some possible Stocks to consider but absolutely no need to rush to buy anything until we get the difficult Autumn period out of the way and some clarity on Brexit.
2506 2018-09-05 12:32:45 Yesss!!! I will sacrifice all future @nike @nikestore purchases. Watch  your stocks plunge.

2531 2018-09-05 12:23:19 They got their own stocks to protect. Cleaner, renewable energy will eventually win out, but not in time to stop climate change, and not before America gets raked over the literal coals by the fossil fuel industries.

what skeletons are in his Closet.He should be careful not to tread so lightly these days with all the Media blitzes on everyone across the Board.With a comment like that stocks should fall and everyone should worry about freedom of Speech!
2534 2018-09-05 12:22:44 I think few stocks like #rswm with new products, own solar energy, water efficiency machinery and many other environment friendly innovations will help company grow
2535 2018-09-05 12:22:42 While Citron may be right in the long run, shorting pot stocks in the near time is a tough game. The risk of a squeeze, then having shares called while the stock is running higher is very real.
Be careful out there (on both sides)
2536 2018-09-05 12:21:46 Time to buy stocks in Nike because when this whole thing blows over WiFi Lit 
2537 2018-09-05 12:21:37 Their stocks fell by 3% after a 5 year straight bull run, including a 50% increase in value the past year alone. I think they'll be fine. 
Also, Puma and Adidas stock was down too. Learn how the stock market works.

2544 2018-09-05 12:20:03 @larry_kudlow The sell-off in emerging markets gathered pace on Wednesday and global stocks fell for the fourth day in a row as a looming deadline in the U.S.-China trade conflict kept the dollar holding firm near two-week highs. NOT GOOD FOR MIDTERM VOTES! It is the economy!
2545 2018-09-05 12:19:56 So... how is selection off an American hating, talentless and undraftable millionaire as the image for your slogan working for your stocks?  Well done!  Great business decision. Way to show how much you hate America

2550 2018-09-05 12:18:14 Ok, so it probably works like a stock loan, just leveraged. Do you use this position to be more long in other stocks?
2551 2018-09-05 12:17:59 I was about to suggest the same thing. Try and record 30-40 mins of action on one or two of the most gapped up stocks   once the market opens so we can all learn for free. I am not Willy I can not trade the best set ups at the best possible prices

2565 2018-09-05 12:12:35 Meh, everything is probably fine. Stocks for the long  haul! Or as Uncle Warren said in the interview last month, "BTFT with both hands and leverage"
2566 2018-09-05 12:12:01 You are right. We should just sell our used products on the cheap to hurt Nike stocks even more so.
2567 2018-09-05 12:11:43 Isn’t the problem not the size of index funds, but that they are mostly concentrated in the same stocks?  Particularly with the proliferation of passive index funds.
2568 2018-09-05 12:11:39 I agree with all of you that you have stated, only thing different is now we are not dependent of FIIs and lot mutual fund money is waiting on sideline to pick good stocks.
2569 2018-09-05 12:11:35 Hey Somesh, don't be disheartened, our second sale will begin on 11th September 2018, 12 PM. We would have enough stocks, stay tuned to Flipkart as we can't ensure. Thanks
2570 2018-09-05 12:11:16 ...stocks are not a good metric to use to jump to any conclusion...any investor knows that...best believe anyone speculating on Nike is shorting for a buy in less than a week from now

How's that?
2571 2018-09-05 12:10:30 Pot stocks and low float bios seem to be the trend this PM
2572 2018-09-05 12:10:14 If the money goes only to stocks you'll create another bubble. Also why would you think that people will buy stocks from the indebted companies? If the books are transparent those might be the last place they'll invest, unless they dont work in the said company.
2573 2018-09-05 12:10:04 More like trusting that stocks dip on such news and generally rebound in short order.
2574 2018-09-05 12:09:32 Well I guess Nike will be losing a lot because we sold our stocks and will no longer Buy Nike products as long as you're a picture on there
2575 2018-09-05 12:09:12 @investor942 @Baker66 I hear you. Money is money. This is one of those stocks you profit off of by following the herd and not knowing TA
2576 2018-09-05 12:09:05 @Nike my daughter sold her stocks in your company our family will never buy your products again
2577 2018-09-05 12:08:13 Hope juventus stocks won't be affected by this
2578 2018-09-05 12:08:07 #BlackDollars & Nike Stocks doing just fine lol
2579 2018-09-05 12:07:13 Chinese internet stocks are getting torn apart on US Exchanges. Even though they trade ADR - they are not immune from emerging market bearishness.
2580 2018-09-05 12:06:54 It feels so damn good when markets fall. If you hold good quality stocks. Have patience and have a long long outlook, market corrections will make you happy and not go in panic.   @FI_InvestIndia @dmuthuk @MrMotilalOswal @Amit_Jeswani @midcap_mantra @akar_piyush
2581 2018-09-05 12:06:49 #nike cares less! Let's keep watching the stocks go down!

2583 2018-09-05 12:06:09 Cop some nike stocks
2584 2018-09-05 12:05:56 My guess is that this is a bit of media hysteria, altho their stocks did take a hit; they will recover.
2585 2018-09-05 12:05:27 James Corden recaps summer 2018 with an exquisite dialogue fitting of a rap. ‘@Facebook’s stocks took a nose dive. Saudi women can finally drive...’, ‘@IHOP tried to rebrand, racist Rosanne got herself canned...’
2586 2018-09-05 12:05:15 I’ll bet you this won’t affect much the stocks, yesterday closed with only cents down, I’m watching how it goes today.
2587 2018-09-05 12:05:12 Funny, did you happen to check the stocks of their competitors during the day? They also declined.. so I don’t think your point is well validated. And besides, I think Nike can handle the pressure of losing a small segmented market that has been tepid in sales for decades.
2588 2018-09-05 12:04:51 Where can I go to buy NIKE stocks?
2589 2018-09-05 12:03:14 mamalit na tag stocks nowww

2591 2018-09-05 12:02:03 Maybe their STOCKS WILL DROP AND HOLDERS WILL SELL.
2592 2018-09-05 12:01:51 AWESOME @CNN @NewDay addition can’t get ENOUGH!! If you miss the beginning due to “International Stocks Obsession”., depend on @JohnAvlon to break it down... Never missed a thing...except for the natural professional chemistry collaboration of having all 3. 
2593 2018-09-05 12:01:16 "Oh Nike's stocks have plummeted-" Yes, back to where they were on August 21st. In other words not really at all.
2594 2018-09-05 12:01:12 I can make money by investing in IT stocks, but isn't that boring
2595 2018-09-05 12:01:07 From the block to stocks
2596 2018-09-05 12:00:58 @Nike your stocks have plummeted,  people are burning your shoes, you pick only Liberals to represent you and put out a presser mocking your customers.  I have to ask, was it worth it?

We're leaving your brand. I guess "Just do it" is the perfect moto..
2597 2018-09-05 12:00:45 Don't have to go that far back. Just remind yourself of the action in the bloackchain/crypto stocks of late last year $RIOT $OSTK $MARA

Honestly it could be nothing, but right now the fear is what marks it dangerous.

2615 2018-09-05 11:55:59 Well - you’ve been wrong on the dollar since April and have been calling for a bottom in gold stocks for months.  Eventually there will be a bottom. You might be right in the big picture for the dollar and gold.  We will know this month.

2628 2018-09-05 11:50:11 Finna cop me some good Nike stocks
2629 2018-09-05 11:49:01 Trump has to have Nike stocks 
2630 2018-09-05 11:48:26 Because manipulating stocks is what republicans are best at!
2631 2018-09-05 11:48:18 That’s the reason you have BTC. Gold and BTC are the hedge against authoritarian Govt. Diversifying through stocks or bonds don’t work as banks are still the gateway to your fiat.

2633 2018-09-05 11:47:46 It will go back up again. All stocks go up and down.

2635 2018-09-05 11:47:05 This shows the world just how much people of color are hated. Is it that serious to burn your Nike and for stocks to drop. Everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but only if your eyes are blue!

2652 2018-09-05 11:41:51 Friday stocks can't  and did effect a decision made Monday. As I said before Nike is a global brand and little boycott from a small number of trumpet can't affect the market.
2653 2018-09-05 11:41:37 30 stocks in Dow and its a Price weighted index. If Amazon or Apple drop 2% its 20 billion dollars in market cap.  Distorting stats all around here.  Impact will be felt overtime not overnite
2654 2018-09-05 11:41:19 Pre-market in US, sure looking like another bump up in marijuana stocks. Getting pretty parabolic over past few days and month. Take care in the whipsaw or soon a multiday dip.

2693 2018-09-05 11:24:18 You realize there's a thing called free speech. I was not even commenting on your conservative agenda. I'm just commenting on the illogical nature of your protest. You really want to protest? Encourage people to sell stocks, encourage people not to buy more.

2701 2018-09-05 11:20:52 When market touches new high every time, the bear side of investors gets blurred. People keep buying considering just positive outlook of stock but they start getting skeptical when market put those stocks in red for few consecutive days and they start calculating value instead.
2702 2018-09-05 11:20:30 Felicia is a kitsune who trades stocks for a living.

2713 2018-09-05 11:15:49 Also, I believe stocks for other shoe companies also dropped. Typical market fluctuations and it likely had nothing to do with morons lighting their shoes on fire.

2750 2018-09-05 10:54:42 The numbers turned out better in the end it seems, OK but they could easily not have. This is the very core of the precautionary principle.

2791 2018-09-05 10:33:13 I think it's because it's just so hard to know for sure with goalies what you've exactly got on your hands with a season Sparks just had.  They're so unpredictable and while stocks are high and teams are willing to send back lots on an asset we're log jammed at maybe we sell high
2792 2018-09-05 10:31:39 Maybe you are tracking mediocre quality stocks.

2829 2018-09-05 10:08:31 Would love to see massive sell off in the Chinese market. If you buy an ETF you should know which stocks comprise their top 10 holdings! You may be in for a nasty surprise. Look at $EEM for example. What we are seeing in Argentina and Turkey screams caution! Am in $YANG calls.
2830 2018-09-05 10:07:54 Yeah but given #Nike recent run up it’s not a good investment given the risk, better stocks out there with same prospects and better risks.

2832 2018-09-05 10:05:52 For all #Entrepreneur 
Global stocks overview: 
US stock futures were pointing lower.

European markets opened down, with exchanges in London, Frankfurt and Paris all dropping roughly 0.5%. 

Asian markets also suffered losses following disappointing Chinese service sector data.

2834 2018-09-05 10:04:40 Oh wow I'm sorry. Do stocks NOT go up and down?  you dont need to be an expert at economics to understand that little bit. Just have an average intelligence. Which I suppose is why you have trouble understanding.
2835 2018-09-05 10:04:36 Good Morning!!!

2841 2018-09-05 10:00:46 As mentioned timing cycles on the $SPY came in yesterday and Friday. This is a healthy and necessary pullback that should ebb and flow this month. I don’t see any serious technical damage to occur. Many stocks need to revert back to their 13ema and 21 ma in their Bollinger Band.
2842 2018-09-05 10:00:31 Yeah we’ll soon find out funny guy!  
Conservatives have jobs though & they own stocks. Nike stock lost 4 Billion in value in a day. That’s just the beginning. Wait til the NFL ends their deal with Nike! Nike will be begging 4 hillbillies back! Cause we know liberals B lazy!
2843 2018-09-05 10:00:04 All stocks fell yesterday, Nike, Adidas Reebok
2844 2018-09-05 10:00:01 If they would have created a group healthcare for the young & working uninsured and pre-existing conditions & left the old way alone. Also to not allow insurance companies to be allowed on the stock market, so not let board members millions$$ in stocks.
2845 2018-09-05 09:59:46 Literally took me a few minutes of research to see a lot of stocks were down severely percent yesterday
2846 2018-09-05 09:59:40 Yes, again a value attributed to him based on aforementioned arbitrary value of the stocks he owns. Look not excusing Amazon business practices and being cruel and treating employees like scum, but the stock price in this case is not directly related.

2848 2018-09-05 09:56:56 Yes sold the last spike. If you think it fades, then there’s you’re answer...follow your gut and watch list it to see if it does. Stocks with this much volatility are tough...50/50...not ideal odds.
2849 2018-09-05 09:56:55 They say you're losing money every single day you don't put money in stocks, but better to hold on than to buy and lose your hard-earned money
2850 2018-09-05 09:56:33 I'm happy to DCA my current $SLV bag, started in the $14 range, down to 8 bucks while waiting for stocks to correct. I just buy like $100/ week straight outta my paycheck anyway.

the $14 stuff would be a 3x ROE if $SLV gets back to ATH, the $8 buys would have a 5x ROE. LFG
2851 2018-09-05 09:54:57 @leroymerlinfr vérifier les stocks pour ne pas se déplacer pour rien. Arriver sur place s’entendre dire qu’il n’y a pas ce qu’on veut. Devoir parcourir la région pour essayer de trouver ce qu’on veut. Ne pas pouvoir avancer sur les travaux de son commerce.
2852 2018-09-05 09:54:28 I'm so happy to see it arrived with you safely! Being robbed is such a horrid situation, so I hope this goes a little way towards replenishing your stocks - please send my love to all the cats!

We only own two single stocks - $AAPL & $AMZN are practically sectors unto themselves - are traders rotating around us? 
2859 2018-09-05 09:51:56 But if only I had the dollars to buy the stocks
2860 2018-09-05 09:51:45 We will still sell items at the event but with limited stocks only. Thanks

2862 2018-09-05 09:51:15 Isn’t their stocks already going down?
2863 2018-09-05 09:50:59 Wow I’ve never even heard of this “symbol” till just now. All these bubble wrap babies find crazy things to cry about. Wishing I invested in the Kleenex and Adult diaper stocks before they blew up.

2870 2018-09-05 09:44:48 Hey Azjdnabe, don't be disheartened, we would be having enough stocks for the second sale on 11th September 2018, 12 PM on Flipkart. Stay tuned.
2871 2018-09-05 09:42:59 Can u list the stocks name..?my portfolio is red from past 4 W/Ks.
2872 2018-09-05 09:41:22 Actually, their stocks are going up now. And why would those idiots be laughing? They are the ones who burned things they paid for.

In short, they are the losers in this story.
2873 2018-09-05 09:41:00 Adidas & Reebok saw their stocks fall, to,  related or maybe just a broader market issue?   Report all of the news!  Stop #Fakenews!
2874 2018-09-05 09:40:01 Is that just on AIM stocks?
2875 2018-09-05 09:39:43 Did he really though? Sounds to me like he’s a bit grateful that the Nike stocks he owns will go up considering all the attention from the controversy.
2876 2018-09-05 09:39:23 Instead of having a portfolio of good stocks.

People have a portfolio of Loans. (Home loan, Auto loan, Personal loan , Consumer goods on EMI....)

2878 2018-09-05 09:37:25 People are hilarious. Stocks go up and down. That fact existed before CK. Judging stock price changes day2day is senseless. Nike won’t suffer significantly from one ad campaign that doesn't offend its target consumer. Nike is signed to multiyear contracts in near all major sports

2880 2018-09-05 09:36:21 I doubt that percentage, esp since every retirement plan I've ever encountered generated dividends mostly through stocks and bonds.
2881 2018-09-05 09:35:34 Never invest for the long term in stocks where Govt intervention is likely to be high, or those  dependent on Govt for orders, or those owned/managed by Govt.  Sheer ad-hocism can kill one's investment.
2882 2018-09-05 09:35:22 Some perspective. Indonesia is touted as one of the world’s future growth economies with a 5% #GDP yet it is also caught up in the current emerging market turmoil with its stocks tumbling 4% on opening & its currency at 20-year-lows. #SouthAfrica is not alone. #economy
2883 2018-09-05 09:35:20 A strong USD has created a contagion in Emerging and Frontier Markets be it currency, stocks or bonds. Regimes may change or coups may happen in few countries too
2884 2018-09-05 09:34:06 Stocks go up. They go down. That fact existed before CK. Judging stock price changes day-to-day is senseless. Nike isn't going to suffer significantly from one ad campaign that doesn't offend its target consumer. Nike is signed to multiyear contracts in damn near all major sports
2885 2018-09-05 09:32:33 Keep telling yourself that. My Amazon stocks have been performing handsomely.

2901 2018-09-05 09:21:05 Never been a fan of Nike. Their shoes are not great just pretty looking. His protest is against the flag not police brutality. The United States has nothing to do what a few bad cops  do. Nike stocks already dropped 3% makes you wonder who the majority is.
2902 2018-09-05 09:21:02 Happy Teachers Day. Learning a lot about Markets and Stocks daily from you.
2903 2018-09-05 09:20:08 I was happy to be part of a billion dollars deal, selling my Nike stocks made me a partnership.

2915 2018-09-05 09:12:16 @Nike I loved your brand. But when you start  using politics in your adds. You clearly don't understand your customers. Ready to lose everything for politics? Who is responsible for this ridiculous decision. Care about your customers not politics. NIKE stocks don't lie. Stay true

3161 2018-09-05 06:18:33 Fishermen are plunderers - not farmers.

3295 2018-09-05 05:07:20 Not saying that it is a direct correlation to Kaepernick ad (As other shoe companies also lost similar value) but if it is... $43 M is great in free ad spend but if the -3% loss on stocks in a sign of whats to come thats not a great ROI as of now...
3296 2018-09-05 05:06:10 They have chosen their side, so let the stocks fall where they may. The corporate takeover of these companies by radical globalist is just one more facet of their diabolical plan to attack, and ultimately take down, America.

3300 2018-09-05 05:04:44 Day 1 of the @Nike debacle was $4,000,000,000 in stocks sold off.

Wait and see how bad their decision is at the end of week 1
3301 2018-09-05 05:03:55 i'm 1000% on nike & colin's side, but no, the price only slipped about 80 cents, it's at an all time high, which imo could signal a drop soon (irrespective of any of this brou ha ha).

i thought about it but decided no (also only 20 cts dividend, there are better stocks to buy)
3302 2018-09-05 05:03:45 ... i still cannot identify the rvol with the stocks that i traded the things i look 4 are vol, news cat, float, still need to identify rvol on my TOS platform, trying 2 stay consistent my grade 4 these trades F- at best.

3326 2018-09-05 04:51:05 It probably was predicted that their stocks were going to drop in the short term, but its going to go up in time. More people are going to buy and keep buying @Nike products in the long run.
3327 2018-09-05 04:51:04 Why? Why? Donate it to homeless. It’s superficial gesture that means nothing to them. You wanna hurt them? Stop buying their crap, short sell their stocks, hit them where t hurts. You’ve already paid for it, they don’t care.
3328 2018-09-05 04:50:36 U r right just do it... we did. We sold a few thousand shares of Nike stick and threw Nike products in an incinerator NIKE is trash. No more Nike products or stocks. U r company is trash

3333 2018-09-05 04:45:38 Low unemployment rates were again started during #Obama. #Trump is riding this wave. And not talking stocks. GDP growth is expected to slow next Q to more usual rates.

Also, #deregulation will lead us back to a recession w/o checks/balances. #GOP regularly puts us on that path.
3334 2018-09-05 04:45:04 I wish I had money to invest in some Nike stocks right now
3335 2018-09-05 04:44:53 I can name several stocks that will do far better, but I won't. Do your own research. Investors are dumping Nike. There will be consequences, sooner or later. They can afford the gamble, obviously. Regardless, the ad campaign is in bad taste and offensive to at least half of USA.

3344 2018-09-05 04:41:34 The elites certainly do NOT want Trump out, he's the one making them all richer with his tax scam! All these elites were able to buy their stocks back at an unprecedented rate! It amazes me that an American pushes the#walkway when it was proven to be set up& pushed by Russians?!!
3345 2018-09-05 04:41:21 I had $212 in Nike stocks before Kapernick thing came out now I’m done to $173

3348 2018-09-05 04:40:12 Of course the stock is going drop. Stocks r simple supply and demand so those who ran to sell when they heard the news caused the 3% drop. In a few news cycles when the next thing becomes the issue of the day the stock will rebound. I bought Nike stock today and plan to buy more
3349 2018-09-05 04:40:06 Mr Loggan is due a big ass raise, stocks and bonds and a damn brand new car even if he stills rides the bus, vacation etc. Why would this company treat someone like this. I don’t care what his job title but he has helped y’all be successful. Show  some appreciation.

3368 2018-09-05 04:33:09 Disagree with everything you just said. Stocks aren't connections. Nobody trades for you. You don't need a good broker or accountant.. contrary to what you said earlier bro.
3369 2018-09-05 04:32:59 Good... I could give a Sh!T.. Nike felt this moron was the BEST example to rep the company.. I hope their stocks go right in the proverbial toilet!!   Another company I’ll be boycotting..

3378 2018-09-05 04:28:57 @Flipkart Seems flipkart is creating this trend of artificial demand by limiting stocks of phones, realme1 was in open sale on amazon but reame2 is in flash sale. I earlier thought that it was the manufacturers, but now I know its flipkart. Not good!

3380 2018-09-05 04:28:22 No I don't think pointing out common sense is making intelligent arguments, but if I am making it too hard for you to understand I apologize. It's simple Nike made a mistake, today was an indication of that. You have nothing to argue that except bringing up two different stocks.

3383 2018-09-05 04:27:38 I thought this was about stocks and value? The under 35 crowd likes CK. Nike likes the under 35 crowd. Politics are demographics.
3384 2018-09-05 04:26:34 And that’s what’s really frustrating. After the Vegas shooting, Congress could’ve banned bump stocks from being sold but they took no action whatsoever. Do they care about the 2A or the money behind it?

3387 2018-09-05 04:24:53 Cory if you put aside $2,000/month that you continuously contribute into stocks/mutual funds yielding, let's say, 20% gain (many stocks make more than 100% yoy today) year over year, u'll have $690,622 in 10 years. Look for stock investing courses on udemy dot com.
3388 2018-09-05 04:23:28 Adidas and Puma lost 2.5 and 1.8 and that’s “because stocks drop” Nike lost 3% and “Nike lost a lot”. So that extra .5 percent is a clear indication to you that people are abandoning Nike in droves?  You think you’re making an intelligent argument with statements like those?

3397 2018-09-05 04:20:24 They should buy more shoes and merchandise to burn. You know, to make sure to get their point across. While they are at it, they should buy Nike stocks... you know, to own the libs. 
3398 2018-09-05 04:20:23 Their stock today dropped to the same level it did August 15th and there was no newsworthy that day. It’s almost as if stocks go up and down everyday (no, seriously...that’s what they do).

3403 2018-09-05 04:18:04 No he hasn't. Economy is ready to tank because CEOs did not use tax cuts for their employees but to buy their own stocks.

3455 2018-09-05 04:03:39 Nike hasn't lost much on their stock, yet. In fact, their stock is still quite  considering just one month ago. A year ago the stock was at 58, today it's a 79. For investors, it's . It has dropped a little from its peak of 82, but stocks do that on  market days.
3456 2018-09-05 04:03:25 @donlemon We welcome you to Home Depot Don. As a part-time employee (full-time job Project Advisor at HBCU) I'm entitled to stocks, 401k, quarterly bonuses, biweekly checks, vision and dental benefits. #don'tsleeponHD!!!!!!!!! Best part-time job ever.
3457 2018-09-05 04:02:15 Real question is how can I buy Nike stocks? #nike #ColinKaepernick @Nike
3458 2018-09-05 04:02:13 Within lol
3459 2018-09-05 04:01:49 Wait!  What was destroyed?  Aside from Nike stocks...
3460 2018-09-05 04:01:06 Like Nike.  But they lost all their stocks.
3461 2018-09-05 04:00:33 I was thinking about NIKE stocks

#justdoit
3462 2018-09-05 04:00:12 That’s just stocks if you honestly think this is going to prevent Nike’s already bullish run this year then you’re not an investor and should even be worrying about this. People in stocks will do stuff like this to sell off high and buy in cheaper. Staywoke
3463 2018-09-05 03:59:59 -Arizona Gov selects a conservative Republican, Jon Kyl, to fill McCains Senate seat.

- Kavanaugh will still be confirmed

-Nike stocks tanked

It's only Tuesday

3465 2018-09-05 03:58:50 We Indians love stuff for free. One example is people buying stocks blindly on the basis of tips given on channels by people who can't even be held accountable for their suggestions but we don't want to get our finances properly planned from an advisor because they charge a fee.
3466 2018-09-05 03:58:50 i know the amount of discipline it takes to open the shop on time, stocks, etc, but beats having a boss above you that's pushing their work on you, when it's not even your job to do
3467 2018-09-05 03:58:44 Nike will be fine dumbass. They have the NFL jerseys,more than half of all colleges uniforms, big teams (Barcelona,PSG,etc) overseas. Stocks go up and down all the time. I’m screenshoting this tweet and we’ll see what happens the rest of the year. 
3468 2018-09-05 03:58:29 We hold stocks that’ll fluctuate 30% over that same time period! 3% is absolutely inconsequential. Also, I am not an investment expert.
3469 2018-09-05 03:57:50 BANK NIFTY FUTURES (CMP:27572.25): Expectation was big gap down opening. But somewhat looks flat opening. Buy with a SL of 27532.25. Upside Tgt:27804.00. Strict SL Please. #bse #nse #sensex #nifty #banknifty #stocks #stockmarket
3470 2018-09-05 03:57:32 I don’t own any so my projected future profits is 0 lol but at least I’m not wasting money on limousine liberal stocks, right? 
3471 2018-09-05 03:57:17 the legislative process and how different bills go through committee and are revised by the house or senate if a change is made, the application of judicial systems, healthcare, trade policy, etc. He might know about stocks and shit but that doesn't make him a good president.

3480 2018-09-05 03:52:14 80% of the stocks in America are held by about 10% of the population. Think about that the next time ANY politician floats the idea of a healthy, robust economy.
3481 2018-09-05 03:51:49 Essentially He knew which stocks were going to rise and which were going to drop?
3482 2018-09-05 03:51:28 My point is that there has been one incident using bump stocks. Banning them won't do much.
3483 2018-09-05 03:51:27 Stocks ARE tanking!
3484 2018-09-05 03:50:51 Because Nike stocks are down.
3485 2018-09-05 03:50:48 Hopefully Nike stocks keep going down

3490 2018-09-05 03:48:55 I'm buying #Nike #Stocks tomorrow because you know that come the weekend they'll go back to buy a replacement pair
3491 2018-09-05 03:48:49 Brb switching my 401k stocks to bar soap companies
3492 2018-09-05 03:47:39 All stocks were down today! It would be fine and he’ll get paid. Everyone deserves a great job and he was lucky enough to be handed this one. The whole thing is ridiculous.
3493 2018-09-05 03:46:15 My "hot take" is that transparency contributes much more than 10% to share price. Stocks with P/E ratios +50 rely on perception of strategy and execution to stay high. It's similar to Elon Musk over-sharing Tesla's roadmap.

Stocks with lower P/Es can stay quieter (Apple, GOOG)
3494 2018-09-05 03:45:25 They’re down a lot in stocks after that lol
3495 2018-09-05 03:45:11 Adidas dropped 2.54%. Correlation = Causation. Far too many variables to reasonably know it Kaep truly affected Nike stocks
3496 2018-09-05 03:44:56 I'd hardly call a 3% drop a plummet. Do you even own stocks?
3497 2018-09-05 03:43:07 He doesn't know. He just wants to punish innocent gun owners for the actions of a psychopath.
3498 2018-09-05 03:42:48 All this talk bout Nike gonna drive up the stocks
3499 2018-09-05 03:41:14 Stupid story CNN.  Lots of stocks fell.

3501 2018-09-05 03:41:06 nigga I wanna invest in stocks when I’m older so I can be a rich nigga 
3502 2018-09-05 03:40:55 Exactly.  Stocks are primarily based on feelings.  When people feel scared they sell.  When they feel enthusiastic they buy.
3503 2018-09-05 03:40:16 If it helps, I think Nike stocks will increase in the next month. They will be laughing all the way to the bank with this.
3504 2018-09-05 03:37:52 Lowkey thinking about investing in penny stocks 
3505 2018-09-05 03:36:47 And if you were really as hot as your profile pic, surely you'd have something going on in your life other than sitting home alone bashing stocks

@Kranti_Sambhav 
Government should Kindly issue notice 2 start the process of conversion of vehicles to #BS-VI emission norm from 2019 to meet the April 1,2020 deadline
Else Automobile manufacturers will give numerous reasons 2 delay e.g. BS-IV engine stocks are there etc.
3509 2018-09-05 03:35:28 In the end, I do admire Nike's marketing strategy. A minor hit in stocks but long-term brand attention.
3510 2018-09-05 03:34:47 Nike stocks dropped 3%
3511 2018-09-05 03:34:46 ALL OF THE STOCKS FOR SHOE MANUFACTURERS FELL AT THE SAME RATE TODAY YOU DOPES
3512 2018-09-05 03:34:32 Nike stocks didn't drop they just took a knee

3516 2018-09-05 03:31:57 If stocks go up or down if they profit or not that is , lol
3517 2018-09-05 03:31:32 Expert on the market, right? Stocks have been trending downward for a week, all across the board. The announcement was made yesterday.

Walmart is down .5 points, when are they closing? The Dow was down 12.34 points, we must be on the verge of economic collapse!
3518 2018-09-05 03:31:18 I need to see if it's in my portfolio because I sure don't want any @Nike stocks or products anymore!
3519 2018-09-05 03:31:04 Best trade in the market is shorting pressure pumping and sand stocks. They appear cheap because estimates are absolutely absurd. No barriers. Market was over supplied Q2. Before demand shrank from diff blow outs and more supply still coming.
3520 2018-09-05 03:30:25 If that was true why don't all mass shooters use bump stocks?

3524 2018-09-05 03:29:40 Because I knew this would be misleading I went and looked it up.. their stock is still higher than it was on August 14. This is what stocks do, the stock will be back over its original value from yesterday within two weeks. I would bet on that
3525 2018-09-05 03:29:35 Fun fact 

Bump stocks aren’t guns

Sooo..........yeah
3526 2018-09-05 03:29:21 Based on July end-stocks at 2,214,565 tons - if adding August production at 1,623,477 tons (conservatively +8% to +11%) - on exports expectations for demand at 1,200,000 -> we have end-stocks at 2,638,042 - this without including opening-stocks.

3528 2018-09-05 03:29:00 Time to buy some Nike stocks.
3529 2018-09-05 03:28:32 All stocks Oversold?
3530 2018-09-05 03:28:16 Got some stocks on which I need to cash on
3531 2018-09-05 03:28:16 We raised the age from 18 to 21, Banned bump stocks, put a 3 day wait period on all firearms, and now a judge can deem someone a threat to themselves/others and confiscate their firearms from them.
3532 2018-09-05 03:28:12 Stocks tend to dip when the respective company is linked to public controversy. Funny thing tho... over time, they tend to uptrend and settle into a higher price range than their initial value before the dip. So I'm not worried. It's just how it goes.
3533 2018-09-05 03:28:02 NTPC, Idea Cellular, Jet Airways and McNally Bharat among stocks in the news
3534 2018-09-05 03:27:37 One day sample size. Stocks are very fluid. Adidas dropped today, too. We will see longer term over the next several quarters as Nike announces their revenue and profit.
3535 2018-09-05 03:27:10 Something is telling me to watch these damn Nike stocks .
3536 2018-09-05 03:27:03 LMFAO.  I guess like others you feel no need to compare with other similar stocks that also took a hit today? HAHAHA  This BNL News account is such bullshit hahaha

3542 2018-09-05 03:25:41 Hi Andrea, I'm so sorry you had so many out of stocks tonight. At this time, our grocery partners do not provide us with complete inventory numbers, so we are unable to know exactly what they may or may not have in stock. Please email us at help@instacart.com for more assistance.
3543 2018-09-05 03:25:07 Unfortunately smart people tend to attempt more difficult things. Difficult stocks are underperforming.
3544 2018-09-05 03:24:59 @senrobportman How's your study of bump stocks coming; or was that another one of your lies? Been a long time. You think the question has gone away to protect your incompetence and lack of concern for your constituents. Not hardly. Time is catching up to you lousy Republicans.
3545 2018-09-05 03:24:53 Umm lots of shoe company stocks fell sadly enough
3546 2018-09-05 03:24:32 HAHAHAHA na tackle niyo na ba yung topic ng stocks? Pag oo ikaw na bahala saakin ha chos
3547 2018-09-05 03:23:41 Similar to stocks there are too many to keep track
3548 2018-09-05 03:23:32 And so did other stocks
3549 2018-09-05 03:23:12 Twain said: "OCTOBER: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in. The other are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February."
3550 2018-09-05 03:22:20 We should also probably talk about the fact that stock prices aren’t directly tied to profit margin. Nike didn’t “lose”  3.75 billion. The value of the stocks own dropped that much.
3551 2018-09-05 03:21:26 Instead of having a portfolio of good stocks.

People have a portfolio of Loans. (Home loan, Auto loan, Personal loan , Consumer goods on EMI....)
3552 2018-09-05 03:21:11 You don't know anything about economics, do you? A 3% drop is nothing and happens every day to thousands of stocks
3553 2018-09-05 03:21:02 Should I be investing in stocks?
3554 2018-09-05 03:21:00 What??!! The economy has the best it's been in 50 yrs. Lowest unemployment, energy dominance, record stocks, etc. You just can't get over the fact that Hillary lost. Grow up.
3555 2018-09-05 03:20:37 Stocks holders aren’t going to be happy
3556 2018-09-05 03:20:19 The markets are down overall. Other companies experienced losses, not just Nike. Looking at September trends, Nike stocks would have probably dropped regardless. King 5 is presenting a false cause-and-effect relationship.

3564 2018-09-05 03:16:44 Yup.... let’s see what happens long term. Anyone remember the Nordstrom boycotts, Target boycotts, or Kuerig boycotts? Take a look at what all of those stocks did long term. They’ve all added substantial value. But whatever. 
3565 2018-09-05 03:16:21 What a great time to invest in Nike stocks
3566 2018-09-05 03:16:07 I'm really proud of what @Nike did in their campaign in promoting @Kaepernick7 cause and his fight for justice. I just wish that black people using the same energy to go and buy Nike stocks and products would invest their money in #blackownedbusiness and help our own!
3567 2018-09-05 03:13:44 What characters did you choose? Stocks? Final destination? Items? Give me those details
3568 2018-09-05 03:13:07 These work similar to penny stocks, but without the regulation.  It’s possibly the the person/company that created the coin was selling by working with the binance market makers

3573 2018-09-05 03:09:52 Actually I give 10% of my income back to God/community. Never burned anything either. Stocks don’t change 15 billion in a day on a regular basis unless your apple/amazon.

3575 2018-09-05 03:09:34 Relative strength stocks (stocks that are outperforming the stock market), tend to be the first stocks to bounce off of lows when the stock market bounces off of lows.

U.S. stocks fell, Treasuries weakened and the dollar climbed as trade tensions persisted and emerging markets remained under pressure.
3581 2018-09-05 03:05:14 It's actually surprised me quite a bit that as people have honed in on the "only the best stores of value can accrue value" idea that more people aren't talking about what properties tokens in distributed network org settings could have that look more like stocks than currencies

3587 2018-09-05 03:01:53 Sold some positions and using the cash to buy up today. It's mental how panicky these stocks are. Buy when people sell. FA hasn't changed. Story still remains. Just need balls.
3588 2018-09-05 03:01:36 Dumping my Nikes, stocks will continue to drop
3589 2018-09-05 03:01:35 I’ve never done it but if I can get some cheap nike stocks imma do it
3590 2018-09-05 03:01:24 Boycott Nike so stocks will drop and I can buy shares relatively cheap, then watch the stocks rise after y'all stop giving a shit when something else offends you.

3598 2018-09-05 02:58:15 You know, if you ever wanted to make money off stocks, I’d recommend buying some in Nike now while it’s low and make a killing when it goes up again.
3599 2018-09-05 02:57:57 Temporary. A hiccup. What hiccup?! It’s the -ber months, holidays are coming. Businesses have to stock up on stocks as early as now but would people have the money eventually? August pa lang ito. Me 4 months pa in the year. Trend is, its going higher & higher. Hayyy
3600 2018-09-05 02:57:42 Cannabis stocks went full parabolic mode today

3603 2018-09-05 02:56:13 You do realize Nike stocks went down right? That's just a start so keep talking!  @Nike Just Blew It! Bye NIKE!
3604 2018-09-05 02:55:34 2/2  I live near Baltimore. I'm assuming I'll never hear you say "Black Lives Matter." About my stocks? Bought at 79.3....no doubt they'll be back to 84 before you figure out what Bye Felicia means.

3614 2018-09-05 02:50:38 can someone explain portfolio dressing? does this really happen? Why would managers would go out now and buy stocks like $AMZN? just so they have them in their portfolio. Like, hey, we had a good year we own $AMZN, $AAPL (of course we didn't buy at highs silly) in our portfolio.
3615 2018-09-05 02:50:33 I never understood her popularity.  Same with Ellen Degenerate.  One thing for certain though.  Stocks will bottom eventually.  Controlled Ponzi scheme.  Bezos, all ... wish they'd invested with Madoff. 
3616 2018-09-05 02:50:05 Nike stocks take a knee...
3617 2018-09-05 02:48:42 Nike stocks will go back up once everyone finds something else to care about next week, invest now
3618 2018-09-05 02:47:59 Top 10% of American households, as defined by total wealth, now own over 80% of all stocks.  Don't let your corporate masters hear you wishing them bad luck.
The concentration of stock holdings among the rich is due to the twin stock market busts of 2001 and 2008. 
#GoldmanSachs
3619 2018-09-05 02:47:59 Y’all really think anyone gives a fuck about Nike like we had money in their stocks lol it’s up to them if they want to shoot themselves in the foot financially.
3620 2018-09-05 02:47:57 And that’s not why the stock fell. All shoe brands stocks fell today.  Some as much as 6%. This article is HIGHLY inaccurate
3621 2018-09-05 02:47:08 I’m bout to buy some of Nike stocks  while they shit Low. 
3622 2018-09-05 02:46:32 Good time to buy then(stocks)!

3624 2018-09-05 02:46:11 Really? Who the hell is the financial guy writing this? Do they follow stocks and do they realize it’s normal for today? @CNN this is sensational crap. Not real news.

3626 2018-09-05 02:46:06 To all the skeptics that ask what point doesn’t make to even bother Nike stocks are down 2.60 per share  and shaved off over 4.5 billion of the companies market cap.
We are winning people we got the power #NikeBoycott
3627 2018-09-05 02:45:55 Apparently you don’t understand how the stock market works. Stocks go up and down daily. I’m sure NIKE took into account the immediate impact. They’ll be in full swing tomorrow!

3630 2018-09-05 02:44:14 All my professor talks about is his stocks & how he gets no say in anything bcos he’s a part timer
3631 2018-09-05 02:43:45 apple stocks rise by 10%.
3632 2018-09-05 02:43:40 normal ppl around my age lame as hell with no fundamentals on how the world works,real estate, stocks, anything that holds value but instead stay with ppl that dont help strive them
3633 2018-09-05 02:43:31 Time to buy stocks from disgruntled "patriots" 
3634 2018-09-05 02:43:23 #Fox says that @Nike shares have tumbled a whooping 3% lol thanks to the campaign with @Kaepernick7 & refer to all other stocks being down as slightly  #Context #StandUpForSomething
3635 2018-09-05 02:43:07 Second, large-cap stocks lose 3% single day all the time. In 2013, $AAPL dropped 25% in a day because of a bad quarter report. It was a blip. 3% for $NKE is a minor annoyance. This is an emotional reaction to a news story and has zilch to do with fundamentals.
3636 2018-09-05 02:42:47 Nike blowin up and i got an email about stocks
3637 2018-09-05 02:42:36 Nike is probably salty right now. They lost 4 Billion dollars today when stocks plummeted. ROFL
3638 2018-09-05 02:42:25 “Nike stocks tanked”?  It lost only 2.6%, which has gone back up in after hours. Companies’ stock price fluctuate, Ms Opninion hostess, that’s what happens in the market.  You might be able to fool your viewers but you’re not smart enough fool normal Americans.
3639 2018-09-05 02:41:19 What was destroyed? Aside from Nike stocks?
3640 2018-09-05 02:40:57 In all fairness, most other shoe stocks fell too. Adidas lost 5.2
3641 2018-09-05 02:40:54 Hey Adam your red wave has become a trickle ..maybe you should be happy our economy is doing fantastic and stocks hit all time high unemployment for African Americans, women and Hispanics is at all time low ..GDP 4.2
3642 2018-09-05 02:40:38 Grabbing stocks at a heavy discount today ... and yesterday ... and the day before ....
3643 2018-09-05 02:39:50 U are a nut job.  These people that you are thanking are laughing stocks in their own miserable cities.  How is the “right side” the side of killing babies?  Mostly minority babies. I guess the ability to give life gives you the power to end a life? That’s psycho Dahmer shit.
3644 2018-09-05 02:38:56 @iubjen Six pair of shoes shredded today...selling my stocks tomorrow

-Do you know how stocks work ???
3646 2018-09-05 02:38:39 Oh boy!  Can't  wait.  Dems will need more tissue if today was a sign of what's coming.   By by RvW! Hello bump stocks!
3647 2018-09-05 02:38:27 Back into looking up stocks
3648 2018-09-05 02:38:21 Buy Nike stocks 
3649 2018-09-05 02:38:19 Have to watch George Soros and Koch brothers buy up stocks to inflate profits like Netflix they had stock dumps but were bought up in days
3650 2018-09-05 02:38:18 Nike stocks tank today. Bad decision.
3651 2018-09-05 02:38:08 Actually, this is the first day and quite a few stocks went down as well as NYSE.  Many are out buying their apparel & shoes now. Good for them for taking a stand. Burning the shoes? Silly. Give them to a Vet & not to mention the chemicals that are being put into the air.
3652 2018-09-05 02:37:53 Both of you idiots’ original point was completely stupid. 1. Outsmarted your business skills? Bottom line is those that own Nike single stocks lost 2% today. 2. Market cap has absolutely nothing to do with bottom line? Yes, it clearly does. Yes, time will tell if their profits
3653 2018-09-05 02:37:32 Mr. Market and non performing, loosing stocks in my portfolio are biggest teacher for me.

3661 2018-09-05 02:35:35 I often wonder at how stocks fall and a week later?  Boom as in exploding.  Look at Netflix.  Hopefully Nike will be the exception and tank.
3662 2018-09-05 02:35:18 Pick up stocks for instance, your staff should be doing that. You, focus on next month’s campaign or product bundle.
3663 2018-09-05 02:35:07 Oh look, a bunch of other stocks in the same category fell about the same amount, wow!

3679 2018-09-05 02:28:21 Stocks maybe lol.
3680 2018-09-05 02:28:07 That man needs lessons on grammar, his words are archaic and barbaric to say the least.

Needs the stocks bringing out for them all, a good supply of rotten eggs!
3681 2018-09-05 02:28:06 Amazon is worth $1 trillion, the founder Jeff Bezos net worth is $164 billion. Many Amazon employees rely on food stamps and public housing. Moral of the story, save as much as you can, start your own business and invest in your own craft. Also consider buying stocks.
3682 2018-09-05 02:27:58 Or lost 4 billion when stocks plunged
3683 2018-09-05 02:27:51 @fabulashchic all shoe company stocks were down today! Nike's knows what they're doing. You're on the wrong side of history!
3684 2018-09-05 02:27:15 Great news, I thought I lost 2% today after taking hits and blowing out my losers.  It turns out I didn't, instead I lost $8K net today which is a rounding error.  Now that's how the winning stocks pay for the loser stocks!! Let's not do that again though #phew #lucky #BullMarket

3692 2018-09-05 02:22:22 @Nike stocks fall, but I'm sure sales are up. 
Stand for what you believe in, no matter the bottom line.
3693 2018-09-05 02:22:14 And, in fact, a bunch of tech stocks slid today, too. FB, Verizon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Twitter, Western Digital. It just wasn't a good day for the market.

3695 2018-09-05 02:21:01 it's one thing to be intellectually bearish and make money long stocks,
don't confuse the two, what counts is the bottom line. period.
setups are setups, if the market doesn't react, then it's talking.
3696 2018-09-05 02:20:49 @Nike hope you enjoy the loss of “we the people’s” hard earned money and your dropping stocks! One BAD decision can have a Huge effect on the bottom line
3697 2018-09-05 02:20:05 Buying single stocks does not make financial sense without substantial capital.
3698 2018-09-05 02:19:59 @Nike pulled the ULTIMATE finesse 1. They got “in” with the Kulture by supporting Kaepernick, now the CEO will definitely be gettin the invite to all the top athletes BBQs.. And 2. People are buying their shoes just to burn them. Nike stocks will be at an all time high #JustDolt
3699 2018-09-05 02:19:45 Why do you think the Sky fired Amber Stocks?
3700 2018-09-05 02:19:10 No you made a moot point that has no relevance to what happened considering multiple competitive stocks dropped the same amount. 

But go off 
3701 2018-09-05 02:18:34 My weed stocks has skyrocketed ..25 dollars a share now valued at 55  ..and that’s just one of them!!
3702 2018-09-05 02:18:30 ‘The Score Takes Care of Itself’ is fantastic. What he doesn’t mention is you need to have excellent ideas, intuition, and judgement to run an organization “your way.” It’s like telling the avg investor to trade stocks.

Leadership needs the equivalent of an indexing strategy.
3703 2018-09-05 02:18:04 Nike stocks are cheaper then the sneakers. Buy them stock instead.  Love Tae'Woo

3714 2018-09-05 02:14:44 Nike is playing chess. They know black people have the worst spending habits & will profit tremendously after their marketing campaign w/ Kaep. I can’t wait see to how much their stocks shoot up after the culture runs to the registers after another retailer manipulates us again.

3716 2018-09-05 02:14:20 How low can Nike stocks go?? 
3717 2018-09-05 02:14:06 @Nike HORRIBLE CHOICE. Stocks will drop like a rock
3718 2018-09-05 02:13:51 So did Adidas stocks were down
3719 2018-09-05 02:12:55 What’s the app called to check the stocks tho
3720 2018-09-05 02:12:51 It went down a few dollars I need y’all to do more... don’t stop at burning the shoes sell those stocks people. We are depending on you 
3721 2018-09-05 02:12:38 I don't have much interest in individual stocks. I like the large number of the Dow and its history.
3722 2018-09-05 02:12:35 Newsflash: stocks go up and down.
3723 2018-09-05 02:12:23 @krassenstein @EdKrassen it is only day 1 since the markets opens after the @Nike ad disaster... but Nike stocks took a hit today. Guessing sales will follow but time will tell. You 2 May want to reevaluate that Nike post you had up
3724 2018-09-05 02:12:19 With bank nifty reached the strong support zone, nifty seems near the bottom. You can slowly accumulate quality stocks that fallen. Ajantha pharma, Hindunilvr, jublfood, bata near 1000 ,reliance near1200. These are applicable as far as nifty does not go below 11150.
3725 2018-09-05 02:12:19 Ya'll better buy stocks from Nike while ya'll can.
3726 2018-09-05 02:12:01 Elsewhere among consumer stocks, @KraftHeinzCo sank 2.8%, @Colgate Palmolive fell 1.8% and @EsteeLauder slid 1.4%.
3727 2018-09-05 02:11:45 @Nike You just admitted your company is Anti-American, Anti-Military, a nd Anti-Law Enforcement. Great job!!! Good luck with your stocks dumbasses!!!! #Adidas all the way

3730 2018-09-05 02:10:50 US stocks fell on Tuesday, kicking off September on a weak note, as investors focused on latest developments on the trade front with the US scheduled to restart tense negotiations with Canada that could lead to way to revising the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
3731 2018-09-05 02:10:40 Nike stocks already going down  and if you disrespect our flag go somewhere else to protest and Whoopie stop making everything about race you Divider!!!
3732 2018-09-05 02:10:21 U.S. Market Check

Equities posted modest declines in Japan, Australia and South Korea, while futures on indexes in China and Hong Kong pointed to a weaker open.

3738 2018-09-05 02:09:20 Fun fact: Even though Nike stocks dropped 3% today, the company has already earned over $43 mill worth of media exposure in the last 24 hrs. Good job with those protests, tho. #JustDoIt #IStandWithNike #IStandWithKap
3739 2018-09-05 02:08:35 At this point need FED reversal to save emerging markets or BUST. Could see US$ double top early 2019... and real cheap EM stocks
3740 2018-09-05 02:08:09 Most athletes are not mindful on how to build wealth and establish themselves financially outside of the sport they play. Especially today....NOTHING is forever! 

Increase Assets (Rental Properties, Stocks, things that you own), Decrease Liability.
3741 2018-09-05 02:08:09 Investors have gone from stocking Nike’s shorts to shorting Nike’s stocks.
3742 2018-09-05 02:08:01 Nike stocks fell
3743 2018-09-05 02:07:50 Stocks go up, stocks go down
3744 2018-09-05 02:07:41 Since they wanna pull their stocks out of Nike, let's put our black dollars back into that same stock. 
Nah, I ain't did it yet but I'm doing my research.
3745 2018-09-05 02:07:39 1. Let them fall
2. Buy stocks
3. Protest will end (because most idiots don’t know how many brands are owned by Nike and come winter they will all be purchasing Hurley)
4. Make a profit
3746 2018-09-05 02:07:33 About to buy some @Nike stocks tomorrow

3751 2018-09-05 02:06:05 yeah, lecture is boring but have you ever had a business major talk to you about his mediocre knowledge in stocks/trades but thinking he’s a god while trying to impress u :-)
3752 2018-09-05 02:05:29 I wonder what race group invests the most in stocks in our country?  maybe I’ll write up a research paper on this phenomenon thanks for the idea girl 
3753 2018-09-05 02:05:17 *above
3754 2018-09-05 02:04:55 Stocks move up and down everyday- & it's not half of Americans -it's a marginal demographic that will continue to die-out
3755 2018-09-05 02:04:27 Okay keep telling yourself that as stocks plummet at organizations that disrespect our president and flag
3756 2018-09-05 02:04:00 on God i’m buying stocks in Amazon
3757 2018-09-05 02:03:59 Under Armour is not primarily a footwear company and has not been correlated to any of those stocks over the last couple of years, so that’s another lazy, uneducated argument. Nike has outperformed UA by over 30% in the last year and 40% the last two.
3758 2018-09-05 02:03:55 I just got asked if I like stocks....it’s a slow night on tinder...
3759 2018-09-05 02:03:25 Nike stocks is only down $2.60. I paid more in gas for that price difference 
3760 2018-09-05 02:03:16 you clearly don't know how stocks work
3761 2018-09-05 02:03:10 Wouldnt doubt it  I wonder who's shorting stocks right now
3762 2018-09-05 02:02:21 Didn't their stocks lose a few billion today?
3763 2018-09-05 02:02:12 Very much enjoyed your video. Let’s hope the shroud over crypto can be lifted, I have faith it can, then just like stocks the outlook can be much greater, sooner 
3764 2018-09-05 02:02:07 Nike stocks are doing awesome today 
3765 2018-09-05 02:02:03 @Nike Not sure what you were thinking or if you were thinking at all??? The American people have had enough. Stocks down, tons of pics with burning Nike gear. I will not buy another Nike product, just like I will not watch any NFL football until they make these players grow up!
3766 2018-09-05 02:01:55 Still making billions. A billion less will not shut down an operation like NIKE. Stocks go up, stocks go down. The people will still buy and wear quality gear. Don't believe the spin of others.
3767 2018-09-05 02:01:55 Mayo twitter really thibk nike stocks are dropping? Yall clearly don't know how the stock market works......isn't that supposed to be a white people thing too?
3768 2018-09-05 02:01:42 Eunucos del Pro.

3769 2018-09-05 02:01:42 I wonder if any other stocks fell today or if it was just @Nike
3770 2018-09-05 02:01:14 While on inflation vigil: Phil stocks are down 1.2% with market prob puzzled by 1-hour delay in release of Aug. CPI data, which the budget sec earlier today said was higher than 6% y/y
3771 2018-09-05 02:01:06 Today I googled how to buy stocks. What did you google? #levelup
3772 2018-09-05 02:01:03 Are you kidding me? I GUARANTEE Nike stocks will soar. FACT.
3773 2018-09-05 02:00:57 There are many stocks which are clearly in a down trend & have shorted those, my current long/short ratio is 70(long) & 30 (short).
Majority of the traders are obsessed with Nifty & BNF, so look at other areas where there is less of crowd & more money making opportunity.
3774 2018-09-05 02:00:44 @Nike just lost me, my kids bc I pay for there clothes and shoes and my wife thinks you suck now too.  Stocks set to tumble.
3775 2018-09-05 02:00:40 SINCE YALL WAS ASKING...
You want to support Nike and make money at the same time TRADE FOREX and STOCKS #MakeYourselfSomeMoney #StopGivingEveryCompanyYourMoney #NotAnOvernightHustle #WhyMakeYourBossWealthy #InvestInYourself #AskMeHow
3776 2018-09-05 02:00:40 Just invested in Nike stocks 
3777 2018-09-05 01:59:44 This just in, @Nike stocks have skyrocketed as many privileged people have rushed to stores in order to buy product, to burn. We recommend donating unwanted clothes and shoes to the helpless and homeless veterans that you say "you're standing up for"
3778 2018-09-05 01:59:30 Ok well did you see any news today? Stocks are dropping...
3779 2018-09-05 01:59:13 I love listening to earnings call audios in the gym... kill two birds with one stone.. stocks I am Long or have on either my Buy or Watch List.
3780 2018-09-05 01:59:12 It’s too early to say that market is bearish for this series. My view will be consolidation zone. My view, Might reallocation by booking profits in large cap to mid and small cap. Only select large cap stocks will do well.

9 stocks only.
3782 2018-09-05 01:58:02 With this whole event with Nike going on I love it cause guess what stocks are down right now will this is going on but really think about it Nike ain’t going no where and it stands for a good reason so gonna invest now make that money when they back at top in month lolol
3783 2018-09-05 01:58:02 Nike stocks went down 3% in one day due to the Colin Kaepernick ad. That’s a 4 billion dollar loss in market cap. How is this smart lmao
3784 2018-09-05 01:57:54 The most common mistake by investors is holding losing stocks for years and years with the hope that one day they might break even...

The Stock doesn't owe you anything, you don't have to make your money back on the stock that made you lose it. Don't be stubborn!

#stockmarket
3785 2018-09-05 01:57:44 Welp! Time to buy stocks!!! Thanks for the heads up
3786 2018-09-05 01:56:40 Stocks rise and fall. Nike gon be good.
3787 2018-09-05 01:56:33 Incorrect. Loses = $0

1) Stock price is not real profit/loss unless you sell it for that price
2) Stocks are not owned by the company
3) stocks go up and down everyday
4) Nike is up 
5) Nike will sell even more shoes

Geezus
3788 2018-09-05 01:56:30 $NKE Nike stocks plummeted 3% today on the news, making the company lose $ 3 billion in market cap. I guess the boycott is working #BoycottNike
3789 2018-09-05 01:56:28 All woman’s outerwear is JUST $10 at BONDS!!
Including, hoodies, pullovers,, trackies, t-shirts, tanks and more!  While stocks last, some exclusions apply. See in store for T&C’s.

3791 2018-09-05 01:55:56 They ready for a surge in stocks..all those companies did
3792 2018-09-05 01:55:32 Several other shoe stocks dropped today, too. Might it be NAFTA-related anxiety? Nah. Gotta be the mayo spill
3793 2018-09-05 01:55:14 I’m tryna get rich off of stocks...so someone tell me how to invest in stocks 
3794 2018-09-05 01:54:52 After @amazon market value reach above $1 trillion, stocks jumped 26.80,or 1.3% to 2,039.51. How do you like the Capitalism now @SenSanders 
3795 2018-09-05 01:54:42 @AskRobinhood let us buy #hmny again! I need to average down and cant buy! We all know its risky! Its part of trading stocks! Thanks
3796 2018-09-05 01:54:39 You're more like Milton who doesn't get that walkers will never be like there human self again.  Just so you know, Nike stocks fell because of their support for Kap and his message. Kap is also still unemployed and his only job is selling the same kinda products you already buy
3797 2018-09-05 01:54:21 He says American icon and that is fine, and all about the first amendment which is fine too. Our choice whether or not to by their products again is our first amendment rights too. And forgive our laughter as Nike stocks plummet
3798 2018-09-05 01:53:54 I saw a lot of screen shots showing them selling their Nike stocks and burning their Nike shoes. The stock spoke for itself today princess.
3799 2018-09-05 01:53:11 It bounced off support at $36.05. Institutions and portfolio managers were adding today. Watch for a huge bounce tomorrow. Most likely about $39.00 PURE MANIPULATION today
3800 2018-09-05 01:53:06 Not very much folks since Stock market plunged today on their stocks..They lost a boat load of money...by hiring Kaepernick and will lose more tomorrow.  They hacked "over half" the country by this...
3801 2018-09-05 01:52:45 I invested $1000 into stocks over a year ago, today I just made back all of that lol.
3802 2018-09-05 01:52:38 Stocks are down. Get a clue.
3803 2018-09-05 01:51:55 Why don’t people understand that Nike already expected the back lash over this ad campaign and it’s a part of their marketing strategy! 
They don’t mind taking a hit for a few weeks on their stocks they will recover that revenue before we blink an eye.
3804 2018-09-05 01:51:55 This is lazy click bait reporting at its finest. Adidas, Puma, ASICS, foot locker Stocks ALL dropped today. @Kaepernick7 got a deal with all of them? Hard to defend against the “fake news” crowd (who youre trying to cater to w this) when you do stuff like this.
3805 2018-09-05 01:51:16 Lol @Nike your stocks just took a knee
3806 2018-09-05 01:51:02 Degrowth in sales is taking a toll. This is normal with fancied stocks when they start slowing growth.
3807 2018-09-05 01:50:22 Been out of #stocks for while cuz #crypto took all my money but we have 2 TRILLION dollar companies folks 
3808 2018-09-05 01:49:55 A new face for @Nike 's ad can make its stocks drop. Crazy
3809 2018-09-05 01:48:56 Stocks are guess work, though. People won't care in like a week.
3810 2018-09-05 01:48:37 and $4 billion drop in stocks!
3811 2018-09-05 01:48:30 So my dad ask me if I have Nikey shoes or anything I go yeah he goes you’re no longer aloud to get there stuff they just signed w the guy that started the kneeling of NFL. I was like yeah they won’t have my business anymore. He goes they won’t have a lot there stocks are way low

3814 2018-09-05 01:47:54 Nike stocks 79.60 down 2.60 (3.16%)
After Hours 79.88▲ 0.28 (0.35%)
3815 2018-09-05 01:47:49 Do better @CNN. Stocks of other athletic apparel brands were also down. In the age of "fake news" and disrespect to the media, you have a responsibility to make sure you get it right and prove these kinds of allegations wrong. A lot is at stake here.
3816 2018-09-05 01:47:22 Dumping their stocks and investments is a good move for what you are intending, makes more sense than destroying something you've already paid them for.
3817 2018-09-05 01:46:13 ESPECIALLY for the average Joe out there. Where else in the world can you earn 24+% per year; work from anywhere. Stocks and RE at all time highs. Question is...Why WOULDN'T you put your money to work at @BitPopulous?
3818 2018-09-05 01:46:02 IPAPPM, JKPAPER & WSTCSTPAPR, these three come under mid-cap, all these 3 were  moved up last year & this year also following up, now at almost ATH whereas most of the yesteryear moved up mid-cap stocks are not in a mood to move up even after corrected or deep corrected.
3819 2018-09-05 01:45:57 Going by his twitter name.. perhaps he believes everything he comes across is a lemon.. cars.. products.. stocks. Must be from his extensive lemon experience.

3829 2018-09-05 01:42:54 Frankly I think it's a great move and  I don't seriously think it matters to them, the fall in stocks and all that
3830 2018-09-05 01:42:41 I thought there was a wall up around 18.25...good to know someone else had the same thoughts... Seemed that they were keeping $APH down after we got over $18. We shall see tomorrow...
3831 2018-09-05 01:41:27 give us a minute  to get to the store to buy their products. who cares about stocks?
3832 2018-09-05 01:41:22 Don’t do it. Buy the best of breeds. Lots of poop pot stocks that weigh it down
3833 2018-09-05 01:41:08 So why was Adidas and Puma down?  Oh I thought we were discussing how stocks fluctuate
3834 2018-09-05 01:41:06 I’m learning a lot about the stock market which is cool, but my professor using MGM stocks as a reference and keeps mentioning the shooting and how it affected stocks and I almost cried today 
3835 2018-09-05 01:41:04 Other athletic companies stocks also fell.
3836 2018-09-05 01:40:52 Most of the Republican Congress, your disgusting excuse for a President and his administration could use a good tarring and feathering and a few days in stocks, Mr Manners.
3837 2018-09-05 01:40:49 Nike, Adidas, Puma and many other stocks dipped today. Lets not make this out to be Nike stock dropping due to this ad campaign because that simply isn’t the case.
3838 2018-09-05 01:40:45 Stocks fell! Now watch peeps going to buy @Nike shoes!! #StocksRising #Win!!! @Kaepernick7 Thanks!!

3847 2018-09-05 01:39:03 Obviously he does... and if he sees something that's costing him money, then he would put a stop to it, but the stocks are doing great, record quarters, Roman is the literal definition of Best For Business.
3848 2018-09-05 01:38:50 None of my friends are trying to buy Nike. They're  trying to buy Nike stocks.
3849 2018-09-05 01:38:47 For most finance journals, stocks are normal enough too. Fun to look at skewness and kurtosis, but we often just ignore it.

3854 2018-09-05 01:38:19 Gonna wait till #Nike stocks drop a little more and buy a few shares.
3855 2018-09-05 01:38:13 The Gottlieb slinging stocks around twitter is great. But charge your phone bra.
3856 2018-09-05 01:38:03 unless you making business calls or using it for stocks LOL
3857 2018-09-05 01:37:49 Hello Prabu,

Yes, with the core skills of price action context and that order flow behind it, you can trade any market. I trade everything from stocks/futures/options/commodities/global indices/CFD's and Forex, all using price action.

Hope to be working with you soon.
3858 2018-09-05 01:37:46 Stocks are one step removed from watching paint dry and tie up too much cash
3859 2018-09-05 01:37:24 If you want high dividend paying stocks. Energy stocks usually have the highest payouts. I’ll get a list of what I’ve been watching
3860 2018-09-05 01:37:13 So, @Nike ? Did you know knee pads cost $2 at the #DollarStore .
Not peanuts ($3 Billion).
AND #WallStreet questions...
Plans on rescuing #Nike?
Would it be based on political biases?
- insider trading?
- $ laundering?
- political bailout?
- Dems?

3861 2018-09-05 01:37:10 I can't believe Yakult stocks went up because of To All The Boys I've Loved Before #hype #productplacement
3862 2018-09-05 01:36:59 @Nike stocks were up 18% this year and about to break $100 a share... and poof now they are on a rapid decline and taking the Dow Jones down with them. Hope they know what they are doing with their latest ad campaign.
3863 2018-09-05 01:36:52 Ha
3864 2018-09-05 01:36:44 It's seems as if #Nikes stocks are taking a knee 
3865 2018-09-05 01:36:39 I do think your idea of blocking the stocks that have already broken out.... they are tempting.... better to be patient
3866 2018-09-05 01:36:38 When @Nike Buy Dem Stocks Back Before They Hit The Top Again, It’s Gon Be Sweet As Gold Ya Hear Me
3867 2018-09-05 01:36:28 Yep...on fire...stocks are dropping. That's always something to be proud of. Tillman would have made a much better person for Nike to show sacrifice. Kapernik is a straight up joke.
3868 2018-09-05 01:36:06 Damn Auto stocks aren’t great. I’ll give you a few
3869 2018-09-05 01:36:01 haha ur mostly right on the stocks,thanks for all the inputs joe natural! ignore whoever he is
3870 2018-09-05 01:35:39 $MNKD hope your holding some after today’s surge. This one will have momentum continuation. Lots of bag holders. Watch her squeeze. Best quock in and out for short term. $SPY #daytrading #stocks #education #easymoney
3871 2018-09-05 01:35:32 Clickbait. ALL shoe stocks fell. Nothing to do with the Kaep ad.
3872 2018-09-05 01:35:24 There are people literally sitting in jail right now on marijuana charges. There are literally people right now making millions off the sale of marijuana (stocks, weed companies etc) let that sink in. It’s absolutely insane!
3873 2018-09-05 01:35:16 Kaso di ko na ginawa. Ang dami ko kayang stocks. Tsaka kadiri hahahaha
3874 2018-09-05 01:34:42 1. All stocks fell idjit 2. They’re not selling them to you
3875 2018-09-05 01:33:54 New balance stocks anybody ???
3876 2018-09-05 01:33:53 Stocks pumping 2-3% on a daily basis. Won't be long till a 10-30% correction happens. These daily parabolic moves higher are unsustainable. Valuations to free cash flow are ridiculous!
3877 2018-09-05 01:33:09 I hope you have stocks.... Lol
3878 2018-09-05 01:33:02 Right! Woke up this morning got my tea brewing then started checking those stocks. Then got me a lil cart going on the website 
3879 2018-09-05 01:32:52 And own stocks
3880 2018-09-05 01:32:27 Or he got Nike Stocks .
3881 2018-09-05 01:31:29 BREAKING. NIKE stocks takes a knee as Kapernick embellishes his oppressive life he lived with million dollar parents
3882 2018-09-05 01:31:17 has management said anything about the stock split. Or are they just going to do it and tell us about other stocks.
3883 2018-09-05 01:31:05 Preach!
3884 2018-09-05 01:30:59 I hope Nike stocks goes way down. Not because of Kaepernick, but because I don’t wanna pay $80 for a zip up windbreaker.
3885 2018-09-05 01:30:49 $SLS Alerted swing last week at 1.04; it hit $1.18 today. $ADMP from $2.75 and hit $3.05 (SWING)--still strong on a run up leading to PDUFA. Possible news soon.

3886 2018-09-05 01:30:44 I think it’s projected stocks..not actual dollars
3887 2018-09-05 01:30:33 he stocks sarsparilla sodas as well. that might be it but I worked there for too long in my mind it equals root beer
3888 2018-09-05 01:30:33 Nike deserves the loss of sales and the drop in their stocks.

3890 2018-09-05 01:29:43 if you get your company wrapped in race, your stocks will drop. 

you can pass on a lesson without having race involved. no controversy, no arguing.
3891 2018-09-05 01:29:40 No gasket blown, sitting back watching Nike stocks drop. Today alone 4 points. 
3892 2018-09-05 01:29:00 So Nike's stocks plummet... buy low folks...
3893 2018-09-05 01:28:59 Stocks also have same refeence point - perfprmance measured in Rupees. That does not mean u will compare with the worst each time
3894 2018-09-05 01:28:51 learning about stocks is like learning how to do accounting for the first time. My brain is like “mm, what?”.
3895 2018-09-05 01:28:51 @carlaskaufel This is misleading. Most stocks were down today, including competitor Adidas. It'll take 30-60 days of trends to see if there's an actual impact.
3896 2018-09-05 01:28:41 Space is affected by gravity, stocks by supply and demand the delta creates gravity. If supply and demand was shifted greatly... wormhole!
3897 2018-09-05 01:27:55 That's not how market cap works. And all stocks are down. Did everyone hire Kaep today?
3898 2018-09-05 01:27:50 Burger stocks rising.
3899 2018-09-05 01:27:44 Another awesome day in the market. Dumped $JWCA for nice profit, I will buy back that biatch later. Buying more $TIG and $GLDN today. Also loaded some $MEX. Grabbed some $EVE too. Not holding a lot of stocks. Keep cash on the sideline to buy any dips. Great day!
3900 2018-09-05 01:27:27 Ha!
3901 2018-09-05 01:27:24 Hmm sure. There's a bunch of different stocks for puma and adidas but like I said I give minimal shits about this topic haha
3902 2018-09-05 01:27:19 Funny yes. Ironically all shoe stocks took a hit today not just Nike
3903 2018-09-05 01:26:47 NIKE just do it?  Yah keep doing it and watch your stocks drop like his career.
3904 2018-09-05 01:26:26 ***perspective***
if I had $127 in my wallet 
and 3.75 went missing 
I would not think on it for a SECOND 
@Nike #ColinKapernick #JustDoIt 
nike mkt cap 127 b 
dipped 3.75 b today 
stocks go up and down every day
3905 2018-09-05 01:25:50 Space is 3 parts space 1 part time. I propose that stocks travel in a similar manner but 1 part space 1 part time. But both realms can bend.
3906 2018-09-05 01:25:45 He is a good investor but having watched his portfolio he buys too early, and sells to early. Many times you can buy his sells. But generally if he held 100 stocks he probably would forget about them and do better.
3907 2018-09-05 01:25:20 Time to buy when the brokerage house downgrade stocks. They just follow price and not any analysis
3908 2018-09-05 01:25:19 The lady that stocks the Pepsi at Kroger?
3909 2018-09-05 01:24:43 Lol you don't understand stocks
3910 2018-09-05 01:23:56 the last financial collapse had to do with banks selling junk to investors - that will happen again eventually. Credit default swaps on RE - right now i don't see any structural issue. Keep in mind during recessions stocks have not always went down.
3911 2018-09-05 01:23:51 They are down 2 points, meanwhile they are up almost 30 points from the 52 week low. the entire market has had a down day too, learn stocks
3912 2018-09-05 01:23:49 I don't believe a bit of it and 
I'm usually a fair judge of character. As a citizen not a journalist it seems I'm able to speak more freely...and no stocks will tank when I say I don't trust Woodward.
3913 2018-09-05 01:23:44 I own a lot of stocks, I agree with this guy, you judge business decisions as a win or a loss based on 24 hs. This one is over down, a loser.  

The worst thing businesses do is be short term thinking- imo. Are a world business, giving up MAGA pales vs the largely anti MAGA world
3914 2018-09-05 01:23:37 Yet...they may still drop him now that the stocks dropped millions and the boycott and burning of their products is in mass display. If they care about their brand,they’ll drop him. If they don’t? Well, I’m sure Trump will add his thoughts more fully.

3916 2018-09-05 01:22:23 Nike Stocks dropped 3% today - lost millions already - but oh ok....
3917 2018-09-05 01:22:21 Nike is worldwide brand & judging a boycott on day of stock trading is nieve. Nike will survive it’s a worldwide brand and the world does not revolve around America. Biggest sales are in Asia specifically China & Nippon (Japan). All sport apparel stocks were down today FYI
3918 2018-09-05 01:21:59 It’s gonna take more than cutting up your bulk Nike factory white socks and setting your Nike walkers on fire to make Nike stocks drops 
3919 2018-09-05 01:21:54 hate having to explain to craig how nike, stocks, younger generation, and analytics work
3920 2018-09-05 01:21:12 these stocks are going to fall so fast.  be careful!
3921 2018-09-05 01:20:15 Their stocks are at a all time company high in 2018, they can lose more than 10 percent and still finish off with more market cap than 2017.
3922 2018-09-05 01:19:50 Everyone is using my code to get free stock & I get one in return lol. Y’all better hop on this money train. I already cashed out $172 from my Apple stock. I also got free stocks in Sprint & Chesapeake energy. I’m not going to cash out no more though so my money can grow 
3923 2018-09-05 01:19:42 Sell me your nike stocks PLEASE!

#BoycottNike
3924 2018-09-05 01:19:22 True it is very early. If you look at guys that got into pot stocks at around $1 they now have made some fortunes. I’ve actually just started doing this hold a core trade a core   (newer to trading). Started with $APH but will most likely begin trading $IAN a bit (holding some)

3930 2018-09-05 01:15:23 Celebrating with another -5% drawdown.  LI stocks annihilated & most coming up on 52 week lows.  My flag is planted but never imagined this humble scenario.
3931 2018-09-05 01:14:41 Tomorrow we get all time highs for the two only stocks that matter $AMZN and $AAPL
3932 2018-09-05 01:14:34 Ima still buy Nike lol and buy some stocks bih 
3933 2018-09-05 01:14:25 Yep, killing it. Talking about something he obviously doesn’t understand. 

Stocks go up and down...shocker!

Killing it!
3934 2018-09-05 01:14:18 You want a reason! There is the reason! The results are the results! The people affecting the Stocks get this news long before we do. I find it very funny! Puma did the same thing and they are also down 1.83% today!  Got another reason?
3935 2018-09-05 01:13:55 Global stocks sag, dollar broadly higher with trade in focus.
3936 2018-09-05 01:13:39 Kiss Levi & Nike stocks goodbye. We all need to stop buying anything they make & let stores know we will not shop with them if they don't stop selling their products. Take A Stand Now or lose You Freedom.

3939 2018-09-05 01:13:03 Company stock, you would have to check, is up something like 27 perc this year.  I don’t even look at my own stocks every day.
3940 2018-09-05 01:13:02 I don't pay too much attention to politics and less attention to investing but I imagine now is a decent time to buy Nike stocks
3941 2018-09-05 01:13:01 Do people know that burning the Nike clothing that you have already purchased has not done anything to Nike’s stocks
3942 2018-09-05 01:13:01 “This Kapernick charade Nike pulled looks like a classic example of pump and dump for their stocks.
They knew exactly what they would get themselves into with this (backlash, stocks tumble).
It was orchestrated for some financial barons to make money, that’s all. “-Jordan Sather
3943 2018-09-05 01:12:49 @SKECHERSUSA I think your stocks might climb within the next few weeks! #maga are coming! 
3944 2018-09-05 01:10:39 This guy just learned about stocks today from Clay Travis, who still does not know what they are.
3945 2018-09-05 01:09:53 What would immediately solve it is the ban of semi automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks

But ammosexuals wanna fuck their guns so much we have to take what we can get
3946 2018-09-05 01:08:10 What is with the sell down across battery related commodity stocks at the moment? Nothing has fundamentally changed? #asx #ausbiz
3947 2018-09-05 01:08:04 Your point? Stocks fluctuate all the time & in this case you’re talking about shareholders being skittish but it won’t last. Do you really think @Nike didn’t anticipate any of this? They’re not amateurs. But again, hold out hope that they’ll go under bc of this decision.
3948 2018-09-05 01:07:53 @SenSanders you got Amazon all wrong sir. Great experience working for my boy Jeff. Pay/Stocks/Growth something politics could never provide.
3949 2018-09-05 01:06:59 Stop complaining how Nike stocks are down 7% and go buy some while they’re low it’ll be back up
3950 2018-09-05 01:06:18 Adidas stocks also down by 5; so yall chill with the narrative
3951 2018-09-05 01:06:14 Could all be a plot.  Drive down stock prices.  A few uber rich powerful can then buy the cheaper stock.  Next year they drop Kap and suddenly become patriotic. The forgetful and forgiving consumer will come back and stocks go up.
3952 2018-09-05 01:06:14 Things to do: Buy Nike stocks ...
3953 2018-09-05 01:05:41 Yep. I’d rather build my son up first. We do investments, have discussions about stocks,self enterprise is big in my household. I’m not only prepping for his future but for his children’s futures (should he choose to have any)
3954 2018-09-05 01:05:41 Nike also hurt their employees who may have Nike stocks and their stockholders.  How stupid is their leadership so glad their leadership is not leading our country and thank God we have President Trump who defends our flag and our veterans.
3955 2018-09-05 01:05:27 Considering going private when my stocks reach 420
3956 2018-09-05 01:05:24 no for the most part they are burning stuff they owned already, it also did hurt their stocks by a few bucks
3957 2018-09-05 01:04:24 … 9-5 + Stocks & investment + Weekend Job …
3958 2018-09-05 01:03:39 The only reason the LDS Church is against Proposition 2. Is because they own $1 billion in stocks with big pharmaceutical companies. Please come to a conscious decision on your own.
3959 2018-09-05 01:03:36 Do you actually think “thousands of people” successfully boycotted Nike on such a large scale that the stocks went down? Maybe it has more to do with fears over NAFTA?

Want to explain why Puma, Adidas, and Asics all went down too? Did Kaepernick sign deals with them?
3960 2018-09-05 01:03:07 Mark Parker Nike CEO made 47 million in 2016 the salespersons avg 18000 and the Vietnamese laborers avg $75 per month. Parker took a 71% pay cut in 2017 because of failing stocks ? At 250 million net worth I guess he figures he can piss off 50% of his customers
3961 2018-09-05 01:03:05 Cool, should I buy now, or wait until after they double down? I have some spare cash in my TSFA after cashing out some pot stocks
3962 2018-09-05 01:03:00 Because imbeciles. They think they've tanked @nike stocks.
3963 2018-09-05 01:02:56 Probably not but I bet they care about their stocks taking a big dive
3964 2018-09-05 01:02:19 Difficult. To get JB to trillion (2018 dollars), AMZN has to be 6 tr. If it’s reached “steady state” then (that elusive goal for tech), a 15 PE implies 400 bn earnings (33% of S&P 500 agg income). But stocks can go insane at times(see 2018); in the short trm, anything’s possible.
3965 2018-09-05 01:02:16 Nike stocks went down 3% - wonder what happens if this back fires and people chose not to buy NIKE gear and it affects their bottom line - will KAP need to find a new job?
3966 2018-09-05 01:01:45 You are good at keeping secrets ... I wouldn’t be able too, perhaps Twitter is useful because it’s a platform to discuss... I googled weed stocks today and savestacks was 3rd on the list ... you’re synonymous with weed stocks according to the google algorithms 
3967 2018-09-05 01:01:37 People can BUY and burn all the Nike stocks they want!!!  For all Nike cares!
3968 2018-09-05 01:01:32 Boooowhoooo America you have bigger issues than Nike and Kaepernick(TRUMP,TRUMP,TRUMP who doesn't stand up for his country who befriends Putin and Kim Jong-un and you VOTED for him) So America where is your backbone for freedom?) Nike just went up in stocks!! FOR TRUMP!
3969 2018-09-05 01:01:05 So you’re saying people boycotted all 3 brands equally? Not just nike? Because the other promoted an article about kap? That’s why their stocks dropped? Sure bud.
3970 2018-09-05 01:00:38 RT SequoiaB: You always buy stocks when they're down. Who in their right mind would buy stocks when they are up? Kaepernick7 still helpin' the cause.
3971 2018-09-05 00:59:56 I’m still buying Marijuana stocks that listed on the NYSE. When you’ll change the policy- it should be worth a goldmine!! $POTN
3972 2018-09-05 00:59:48 And instead of real money, have your wealth in the form of stocks that you could never actually sell for $160 billion.
3973 2018-09-05 00:59:48 And yet your "yawn" does nothing to show what "Nike" stocks ended with today. Dumped mine!
3974 2018-09-05 00:59:34 Do you think if Nike told Colin Kaepernick they were going to pay him in stocks he would have said "F*ck no!"
3975 2018-09-05 00:59:24 Every time I see people talking about gun control I buy more then I buy the stocks too.

3984 2018-09-05 00:55:06 Great time to buy them Nike stocks!!!
3985 2018-09-05 00:55:00 Almost 4 points in one day. Stocks don't fall that much in one day unless there's a reason! Hello? "Such naivety"
3986 2018-09-05 00:53:46 Looks like I need to purchase some stocks in @Nike now. @Kaepernick7 Sacrifice for what you believe in 
3987 2018-09-05 00:53:42 Look what he does with Brock!!! Jesus hell sell his stocks to sign them!
3988 2018-09-05 00:53:41 Dennis they're still in denial and their mind the election was stolen but they had a bad candidate. They had a candidate that was a crook liar and gave away 1/3 of our uranium stocks uranium one they can't stand to think he can get another Supreme Court Justice on the court
3989 2018-09-05 00:53:23 Stocks rose in spite of the economic challenge he walked into. Perhaps you should be making more. Lower taxes....for you and me?  Let’s see.  Where was Obama? Working thru a first term monster. Second term?  I recall a very Republican house and congress...rather uncooperative
3990 2018-09-05 00:53:19 Damn Nike took a BIG ass hit in Stocks today where yall niggas thats said yall running it up today
3991 2018-09-05 00:53:16 You always buy stocks when they're down. Who in their right mind would buy stocks when they are up? @Kaepernick7 still helpin' the cause.
3992 2018-09-05 00:53:15 What a stretch, they see nazi everywhere except in the mirror.
3993 2018-09-05 00:53:13 He donated over a million dollars . Not millions but he still kept his word and donated his money . What facts did you give ? You said Nike will fall  and pay for this, that’s an opinion. You brought up Tillman , and you brought up Nike stocks . Nike is down but so are others
3994 2018-09-05 00:53:04 Let me see ...didn't sell half the country uranium stocks; doesn't use a personal server (that was hacked) for classified information then lied about it....Shall I go on? Have you read the definition? Try it. You might learn something.
3995 2018-09-05 00:52:20 Pot Stocks “smokin” today!  #CGC, #TLRY
3996 2018-09-05 00:52:12 get this they said thet the #nikeboycot will not last. what do they know. i know Nike stocks are down. just like they said that #BlackLivesMatter would fade away
3997 2018-09-05 00:52:11 Nike stocks are down 400 percent the American people are going to boycott Nike for a very bad decision Colin kaepernick is a traitor to the American people for him to kneeling during the national amphibians boycott Nike
3998 2018-09-05 00:51:43 Nike's stocks took a hit for it too
3999 2018-09-05 00:51:42 All they had to do was go with the Just Make Shoes Great Again campaign and their stocks would have went through the roof!! What idiots
4000 2018-09-05 00:51:33 Are you going to continue to ignore Adidas and Puma’s stocks going down too? Did you ever consider that this has more to do with NAFTA?

Well, I guess you have a narrative to push, so I understand.
4001 2018-09-05 00:51:32 Stocks change. Daily.
4002 2018-09-05 00:50:45 @MerrillLynch Hello, I would like to acquire information about a primary account number about some stocks. I would to thank if you can provide me some mail or some way of communication to know about this.
4003 2018-09-05 00:50:36 14 of 15 dissertation have been adopted by the Court. Your resistance is futile you Chinese spy
4004 2018-09-05 00:50:21 Let them Nike stocks drop again.  I’ll be calling nationwide tomorrow.
4005 2018-09-05 00:50:13 This keeps up. Hillary’s gonna need to add a few wings to the compound in the woods and buy the Mondavy winery to keep the Chardonnay stocks flushed. The Left is unhinged.
4006 2018-09-05 00:49:42 $EXL showing it's quality. Feels like marijuana stocks could get another wave soon enough especially if Althea IPO reignites the sector. 
Let's see
4007 2018-09-05 00:49:12 You make $40K after your huge raise and massive money from stocks?
4008 2018-09-05 00:48:47 Stocks vro
4009 2018-09-05 00:48:18 i love it too...stocks going down lol
4010 2018-09-05 00:47:47 Yeah cause stocks never fall and always go up. Such naivety is adorable
4011 2018-09-05 00:47:37 So let me get this straight Steve Grasso's kids cant wear Nikes but he can invest and pump Weed stocks on National TV.. interesting!
4012 2018-09-05 00:47:03 I got to get back in to stocks and stop pulling my money out of stuff
4013 2018-09-05 00:46:51 I'd have to say that any correction coming in US Stocks will likely be swift and a chance to BTFD with the mind open to rotating into the 'next thing'... I can't say owning bonds looks compelling other than for trades here and there.
4014 2018-09-05 00:46:24 Also a smart investor would purchase nike stocks when low..
But you're probably wasting your time burning shit you spent your own money on
4015 2018-09-05 00:46:20 I agree!! Stocks have already fallen. For them to come out and say this today, is suicide.
4016 2018-09-05 00:46:07 Well if you look at their stocks....... Yes, they are losing.
4017 2018-09-05 00:45:39 looks like we are winning #nike stocks took a hit on wallstreet #NikeBoycott
4018 2018-09-05 00:45:04 Had a good day at work. My stocks went up
4019 2018-09-05 00:44:57 Stocks dropped 3% today, fell below $80 a share. I got out just in time!
4020 2018-09-05 00:44:43 So far NIke has lost $4.2 BILLION as stocks & sales plummet! Are they using Colin to cover up their foreign "slavery" & sexism as they pay "slave-wages" in foreign countries to have their products made?
4021 2018-09-05 00:44:17 Nobody is complaining about NHRA Pro Stocks.
4022 2018-09-05 00:43:48 Very excited about these next few months trading, so many great stocks to trade in and out of, and volatile, just how i like it! #GGP #PREM #KOOVS #GWMO all on the boom watchlist between now and xmas  where do i put 10k? Thoughts?
4023 2018-09-05 00:43:22 Lol and you realise those stocks will be up by the end of the week proves how little understanding you have when it comes to businesses
4024 2018-09-05 00:43:09 Good. Stocks and down and companies will cut all marketing.
4025 2018-09-05 00:42:06 $SPY Don't be fooled by some of these wiggles and/or news on the market. Some strong setups in the works on select stocks (under the radar)
4026 2018-09-05 00:42:04 #DeepThoughtsOnTheToilet Sell all #Nike stocks Let’s see how low can it go #NikeBoycott #NikePurge #JustDolt #MAGA
4027 2018-09-05 00:41:53 Lol using the normal flow of stocks (ups and downs) as proof for pushing your agenda.
4028 2018-09-05 00:41:43 Not really though. The stock only went down by a couple dollars and that’s probably only because stock brokers got scared so they sold some shares. I bet only a few people actually sold stocks because of the campaign. They actually made about 43 million so far because of it.
4029 2018-09-05 00:41:32 Yea, their stocks only lost 3.75 billion today. GENUISES. LOL
4030 2018-09-05 00:41:23 Someone teach me me how to invest in stocks.
4031 2018-09-05 00:40:40 How much money has @Nike to lose in one day? They hvnt lost any money. All 3 sneaker companies have gone down in stocks a little, but thats how it is.  Nike will be just fine.  You do know @adidas also wanted @Kaepernick7  right?
4032 2018-09-05 00:40:15 Who shorted Nike stocks? Might be interesting to know
4033 2018-09-05 00:40:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4034 2018-09-05 00:39:22 Stocks will always go up/down, but it's the  activity that counts! Whether it's positive or negative! 
Right now, I see a lot of negative...
Sorry!
4035 2018-09-05 00:38:45 How much you flexing in stocks?
4036 2018-09-05 00:38:38 the real antagonist of raildex is capitalism. misaka spends all her money on gekota merch and uiharu stocks up on chocolate parfaits, and in the end saten is the only who spends money on actual clothes. 
touma is just going to starve to death im sorry
4037 2018-09-05 00:38:25 Might want to watch it again mate. Pretty sure it says shares or stocks.
4038 2018-09-05 00:37:28 Let's do a 420 survey, if you were to pick and to invest in one these Marijuana stocks, which one would it be? Please pick from list below

$APH $CRON $WEED $ACB #420friendly #MarijuanaStocks #marijuananews
4039 2018-09-05 00:37:13 tenure -- also played a role in stabilizing the markets.
The dramatic rise of several big technology stocks in the past eight years has also helped propel the market higher. That had little to do with Obama.
Apple's (AAPL) shares surged more than 415% since he took office.
4040 2018-09-05 00:36:49 I need to up my knowledge on stocks
4041 2018-09-05 00:36:22 Sell Nike Stocks!!
4042 2018-09-05 00:36:09 What’s get your fax from fake fox news because their stocks did not go down. You’re entitled to your opinion but you’re not entitled to the facts which makes you a liar
4043 2018-09-05 00:36:03 Feels like it’s been ages waiting for the @magpul Bipods AND Hunter stocks for the American rifles from @rugersofficial, but it was well worth it! @ Wade's Eastside Guns
4044 2018-09-05 00:34:34 so the more $200 pairs you sell + the fewer $50 pairs you sale increase profits and decrease costs. Revenues increase and expenditures decrease. Quarterly reports come out and reflect that...stocks take off.
4045 2018-09-05 00:34:30 Cobalt, lithium, copper mining stocks to play the electric vehicle revolution.
4046 2018-09-05 00:34:20 I don’t know stocks and I can’t read very well but even I can tell that it’s a train wreck of a situation
4047 2018-09-05 00:34:14 The best way to show our feelings is to not buy their products and sell your stocks if you have any  I won’t support them in any way. To me they don’t exist. Period 
4048 2018-09-05 00:34:03 The owners of those corporations are the stock owners (shareholders). Those stock owners are mostly the hard workers you are referring to who have pensions, 401ks, IRAs invested in mutual funds that have portfolios invested with the stocks of thousands of different corporations.
4049 2018-09-05 00:33:55 Stocks fall and rise daily! Lmao
4050 2018-09-05 00:33:38 Nike put some text on a black & white photo and boosted their stocks.
4051 2018-09-05 00:33:37 I can’t wait to buy some nike stocks!! Gonna wait a little longer before, should hit an all time low in the very near future!! Na bellezza!!!!
4052 2018-09-05 00:33:21 Twice contributed really well. No one's questioning that but people always question GOT7's contribution to JYP stocks which makes me wonder why.
4053 2018-09-05 00:32:58 Stocks & Bonds 
4054 2018-09-05 00:32:31 Invest in Nike because stocks is going down smh
4055 2018-09-05 00:32:29 Y’all better buy your Nike stocks now. Lol
4056 2018-09-05 00:31:36 *buys Nike stocks since they're falling and cheaper* yes, burn #Nike things. In fact, buy more and then burn em to show how horrible Nike is! (Wait...stocks go up when people purchase Nike things right? Trying to make money here) 
4057 2018-09-05 00:31:33 I rounder who made the stocks ?
4058 2018-09-05 00:30:57 I had that stock before but glad sold it. There are better ancillary stocks,  have -  kshb,grwg, srna
4059 2018-09-05 00:30:54 Although I haven't sold, so nothing is guaranteed yet, sitting on close to a 700% return on $WEED in a short 8 months is nothing short of spectacular. I debated selling many times, but toughed it out and held on. #wow #stocks #investing
4060 2018-09-05 00:30:32 Their stocks already dropped today. What is wrong with these people? Dicks sporting goods is finding out right now too.
4061 2018-09-05 00:30:18 Nike stocks are down today. Look it up! 3.16%.
4062 2018-09-05 00:30:15 @NBCNews 
Are you watching 
@TuckerCarlson he's calling you out on your hypocrisy. I'd sell any stocks in @NBCNews and @MSNBC it looks like your days are numbered. Shoulda played it straight.

4064 2018-09-05 00:30:02 My iron ore and gold miner stocks were down 5.0%, too. Did minerals do something you don’t like?
4065 2018-09-05 00:29:32 Their stocks are  going down will fast .
4066 2018-09-05 00:29:03 I didn’t think that’s what we were talking about. We were talking about the JYP building and how much Twice contributed to it and the JYP stocks...
4067 2018-09-05 00:28:28 I dont care what thier ad says because thier quality went down years ago. But stocks are down 5 billion over 2 days after the add release speaks volumes
4068 2018-09-05 00:28:25 Lessons from 4 months of day trading so far:
Know your exits before entering.
Start small. wait for confirmation.
know overall market trend
don't over trade and be over exposed at any one time
#daytrading #stocks $AMZN, $FB, $AAPL
4069 2018-09-05 00:27:59 feeling like a big girl after learning more about stocks/investments and what not, yes! lol
4070 2018-09-05 00:27:24 Our parent's parents had the opportunity to gain wealth through stocks and a lot missed the opportunity. OUR parents had the opportunity to invest into the internet (Yahoo!, Google) yet a lot missed it. We currently have the opportunity to invest into Blockchain-Technology.
4071 2018-09-05 00:27:09 If anyone who works for Adidas or UA is smart they are gonna do some shit while nike stocks are down and people are boycotting them. Id like to see them do something

4073 2018-09-05 00:26:52 I don’t burn s... but so far the whole NFL Biz is down quite significantly & today the Stocks went down too!
4074 2018-09-05 00:26:35 UUMMM
CHECK FRIDAYS STOCKS
4075 2018-09-05 00:26:31 Nike stocks continue to tumble
4076 2018-09-05 00:26:25 The difference is in n outs profits skyrocketed during the course of the boycott. Nikes stocks dropped almost 4 percent. Get out of here with that malarkey
4077 2018-09-05 00:26:08 Everybody pointing to the #NikeBoycott as the reason for the 3% drop in Nike’s stock need to look at Adidas & Puma stocks which both dropped about 2% because of #NAFTA negotiations going to shit thanks to their boy, Trump!
4078 2018-09-05 00:25:25 Other than #forex what else do you guys #DayTrade ? I am thinking of getting into #stocks but I need to study up on the subject just like I did with forex because there is tmi on the subject 
4079 2018-09-05 00:24:45 Tried to bond (no pun intended) w my dad about the stocks i have doing well and he hits me w “don’t confuse a bull market for brains” #spoken like a life long financial advisor.
4080 2018-09-05 00:24:26 My green closing stocks:  RJDG .0068 +24%(news)....UHLN .001 +11%....PAOG .004 +7%....GATA .087 +2%....DIRV .005 +1.9%....LWLG $1.09 +1%
4081 2018-09-05 00:24:24 Really?  You overestimate yourselves. Everybody was down today, not just Nike. They'll be back up. That's what the stock market does, it goes up and down, all the time. I'm guessing you don't have any stocks in anything, right? If so, you probably lost money anyway.
4082 2018-09-05 00:24:19 Nike stocks shooting down?  Guess it’s time to invest so when all these monkeys forget about it in a month their stock shoots right back up
4083 2018-09-05 00:23:55 Stocks drop for nike
4084 2018-09-05 00:23:42 Yay! One less racist owning Nike stock! I’ll gladly buy your stocks! #ISupportNike #isupportkaep

4086 2018-09-05 00:23:33 Nike stocks drop
4087 2018-09-05 00:22:43 Jeff say  my stocks 
4088 2018-09-05 00:22:39 Their stocks fell 3.5% they are definitely loosing money
4089 2018-09-05 00:21:59 Stocks cant go down
4090 2018-09-05 00:21:16 I said you were in the middle of a tantrum, you big baby. The fact that Nike stock is going down by about 2% the day after you goobers started lighting your socks on fire is irrelevant when Adidas, ASICS, and Puma stocks are ALSO dipping by about 2%.
4091 2018-09-05 00:21:14 Stocks dumped billions. 

Cut the sweat shop salaries.
4092 2018-09-05 00:21:12 The sound of Nike stocks rising and people rushing  to buy more Nike products is even better #NikeBoycott is stupid!
4093 2018-09-05 00:20:06 Since your quoting athletic brand stocks, how did Adidas and Puma do today?
4094 2018-09-05 00:19:53 BUY NIKE STOCKS
4095 2018-09-05 00:19:39 Ok so I asked markail do he want to invest in stocks this nigga said why would I want to buy some socks
4096 2018-09-05 00:19:15 What stocks are you day trading this week? $ssc 
4097 2018-09-05 00:19:03 Chess not checkers gotta get more stocks
4098 2018-09-05 00:18:48 You've been watching to much fake news or your stocks are down in the arms industry.
4099 2018-09-05 00:18:14 ima just tell y’all now. buy stocks in amazon. a co worker made 25k in two years doing nothing
4100 2018-09-05 00:17:22 They knew this would happen. Stocks will drop just off feeling. They know they will sell and sell and sell.
4101 2018-09-05 00:16:34 $STAF like it here, think it goes much higher. Of course if they manipulate the stock, it can drop, like anything. Just my opinion. #Stocks
4102 2018-09-05 00:16:10 Dear @Nike,
@adidas makes better shoes anyways. Can’t wait to see stocks plummet.
4103 2018-09-05 00:14:31 Last year's tees were really cool. Shame none of the Wal Marts near me got them. Really hope they do them again this year and that my Wal-Mart actually stocks them
4104 2018-09-05 00:14:22 Hello under armor stocks!  #BoyCottNike
4105 2018-09-05 00:14:02 Buy as many as you like.
You couldn't make up for the loss of @RealJamesWoods stocks alone.
Lol
4106 2018-09-05 00:13:58 Forget Nike...

My cannabis stocks are up 10%!
4107 2018-09-05 00:11:30 Because a sports company did. See how well that worked for them. Stocks took a huge hit. In and out burger is doing well after the lefts attack. #RedWaveRising2018
4108 2018-09-05 00:10:57 What were your 5 stocks on today’s segment? Loved the whole segment just can’t recall all 5! Appreciate it
4109 2018-09-05 00:10:47 I saw to The Nightly News, Nike stocks fell drastically today ..... hmmmmmm
4110 2018-09-05 00:10:32 Now's a good time to invest in your stocks huh? @Nike 
4111 2018-09-05 00:09:44 Stocks tumbled. These people lack even reasonable business skills. Stockholders must be furious.
4112 2018-09-05 00:08:26 hey there james. couple ov questions wat u think ov these stocks...roku, tlry, nugt, and cei. thanx in advance
4113 2018-09-05 00:07:04 Fascinated by #Nike’s 3% drop in share price over #Kaepernick: is the company beholden to the young black men who buy the shoes or the old white men who buy the stocks? 
4114 2018-09-05 00:07:03 Boom with the weed stocks!!! Only time I support and Praise Canada! Lol!!!
4115 2018-09-05 00:06:04 I look like I get stocks for christmas
4116 2018-09-05 00:04:11 Did you look the stocks of the other similar companies ??? They are ALL down 1-2% today.   This was NOT because of Kaelernick  it was because that’s the market.  Way to pull a Trump to change the truth
4117 2018-09-05 00:03:51 Asia equity markets begin subdued after the weak lead from Wall St where stocks had somewhat of a Labor Day hangover amid trade related concerns and ahead of the looming risk events; ASX 200 (-0.1%), Nikkei 225 (-0.2%), KOSPI (-0.2%)
4118 2018-09-05 00:03:43 All these pot stocks are simply a game of hot potato now.  Fun while the music is playing, just don't get caught when the music stops.  $TLRY $CGC $CRON
4119 2018-09-05 00:03:30 Here , I want to know about stocks, and why they became cheap
4120 2018-09-05 00:03:05 And we will see how that works out for them!!!  I heard the stocks took a hit already

4122 2018-09-05 00:01:34 Nike stocks dropped 2.38 since Friday so did they really make 43 million or lose that much?
4123 2018-09-05 00:01:12 I own 2. A large and small. Great multi-taskers. Not just for splatters but a fine mesh strainer also. I use it to clean deep fry oil. Strain stocks etc.....
4124 2018-09-05 00:01:11 “This Kapernick charade Nike pulled looks like a classic example of pump and dump for their stocks.
They knew exactly what they would get themselves into with this (backlash, stocks tumble).
