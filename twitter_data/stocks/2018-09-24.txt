16 2018-09-24 23:46:07 For arguments sake, let's say you have 1 share of $10 stock and 2 shares of a $5 stock, if both stocks double you still have $20. Even though you had twice as many shares of the $5 stock.

45 2018-09-24 23:41:29 @michaelbatnick your latest post is clutch. Another perfect example of how most individuals who start investing by thinking they’ll be the next Buffet picking stocks only to learn it’s harder than you think 
46 2018-09-24 23:41:12 No they don’t make money on spread. The orders don’t go to market so how could you be possibly be able to get filled on ask or bid? If that was the case it would be too easy to scalp large spread stocks haha I would be so rich

54 2018-09-24 23:36:17 #RT @meirbarak: @zeek Low average price and/or low average trading volume stocks are not tradable on the platform as these stocks are highly volatile. The broker’s department of risk management has deems these stocks too volatile to trade.
55 2018-09-24 23:35:22 My stocks are booming.  Being a landlord my real estate holdings are wonderful. Thank you Obama. That said i can't help the sinking feeling a a recession is right around the corner as most of the economists predict. That and the trillion debt that idiot in the white house added.

58 2018-09-24 23:30:32 I’m not affiliated with any class. New job. Should net $70,000 this year, and then an additional $180,000 next year if things go accordingly. This is aside from stocks, but I will gradually be adding more to my portfolio.
59 2018-09-24 23:27:40 There all out of hope I hear? Apparently, they’ve used so much of it since Nov 16, stocks are all but depleted.
60 2018-09-24 23:26:02 You're right about that, but I prefer trades where I have a bit of time to think. Listening to your YouTube intro video at the moment and you mention not being into penny stocks which is a big plus.
61 2018-09-24 23:23:02 Yeah but he's like the fucking corniest cracker ever so he probably invested in all in like mayonnaise stocks

63 2018-09-24 23:22:41 This is only one incentive they have. Another one is that when stocks plummet, the rich people with excess liquid assets can buy up massive amounts of ownership dirt cheap.

70 2018-09-24 23:20:49 This greatness is too big for Nintendo NOT to know about it. They know what they must do to keep there stocks high and maybe raise them even higher and make bowsette an official Mario character.

75 2018-09-24 23:16:49 Everyone gets to invest in a 401k and usually companies can give you stocks in the company if you have been with them long enough, I had stocks in Foodlion when I worked there for almost 10 years. It was a good chunk of money.
76 2018-09-24 23:16:05 I was not profitable at trading stocks in high school your honor, so my current insider trading activity is irrelvant....n'est pas?
77 2018-09-24 23:15:00 Your statistics are flawed & extremely disingenuous. “100 million more Americans (who own stock)” is not a reality for average Americans. False talking point of GOP. Yes Americans are invested in stocks via their 401K’s. Yes they have risen. The have been for the past 8-9 years.

85 2018-09-24 23:05:29  Review these #stocks that set record highs: $CRM
86 2018-09-24 23:04:35 What you are saying is that "EPS of $10 is better than EPS of $1." The answer is "it depends". If the stock price is $100 and EPS is $10, it's trading at 10x earnings. If the stock price is $10 and EPS is $1, it's also trading at 10x earnings. The two stocks are valued the same.

102 2018-09-24 22:56:02 Does FOX RESEARCH know 20% of Americans own 92% of stocks. Only 51% of America owns some stock. Most of that money is going to the rich. Just like Trumps tax cuts. 83% of tax cuts go to the richest citizens.

110 2018-09-24 22:47:43 -since Oprah got on board in 2015, the stocks have risen 400%. That means, whoever held on to that stock is  a lot richer now, then a few years ago.

119 2018-09-24 22:39:44 I would agree half of the stocks I’m looking to trade aren’t available.
120 2018-09-24 22:39:11 This is suppose to happen most of the stocks been over priced since a long time
121 2018-09-24 22:39:00 Stocks are up. And yes it will be more expensive for us working people. But guess what?? We will be buying American and keeping Americans working and putting more money into American companies which leads to a more profitable America which also leads to raises. What’s the problem

128 2018-09-24 22:35:33 Good point, Steve, I forgot to mention how corporate profits have pushed the stock market (and, hence, my retirement accounts and net worth) to record highs.  That's 100 million more Americans (who own stocks) that are helped by Trump's economy.
129 2018-09-24 22:35:23 My colleague @KrisRosemann said wisely that every decision is an active one, even for a passive investor. 

To hold stocks means every day you would have bought them, or are willing to buy them. That you do nothing is an active decision.
130 2018-09-24 22:34:17 Low average price and/or low average trading volume stocks are not tradable on the platform as these stocks are highly volatile. The broker’s department of risk management has deems these stocks too volatile to trade.
131 2018-09-24 22:33:42 No matter what you do, you just can't please everyone. But if @FIFAcom @UEFAcom and @CAF_Online don't sit up in a way, these awards are going to become laughing stocks in the future. Most fans already losing genuine interest. From a concerned super football lover. #TheBest
132 2018-09-24 22:33:30 5 biotech stocks that hedge funds including Baker Bros, Armistice, RTW, have acquired more than 5% of outstanding shares recently: $PGNX $PRNB $ACAD $IDRA $PRQR
133 2018-09-24 22:33:04 Stocks that finished the day up 10% with high volume:

134 2018-09-24 22:32:55 Sure. But you are likely speculating more on individual stocks than a mutual fund. A single mutual fund is likely more diversified than a regular investors portfolio. That probably makes more sense for the average person who doesn't want to manage regularly.
135 2018-09-24 22:32:04 stocks depend on the terms and the issuer — the wrapper doesn’t matter and can be changed by the issuer 

Apple is worth its market value based on its revenue etc — if they issued a token those economics don’t change and that token would have value as long as Apple did

221 2018-09-24 21:46:10 Passive investors believe long-term investing is #magic. Look at this or that chart, they say.

No -- stocks collect enterprise cash flows causing their fair value estimates to generally increase over time, all else equal.

Fair values, however, don't have to increase over time.

338 2018-09-24 20:47:03 The reason you invest in both stocks (throwing) & Bonds (running) is when one is struggling in the market (game) the other usually thrives or progresses. It doesn't have to be one or the other. Moving Andersen to RB doesn't take him out of game, but does provide more options!
339 2018-09-24 20:46:28 Set limit orders, don't worry about getting the BEST price, just try to get a good one.

371 2018-09-24 20:31:39 actually another difference between bonds and stocks is that most of the performance of your portfolio is not going to come from 1-2 bonds. Comparison only goes so far.

396 2018-09-24 20:13:12 World stocks lower: Europe -.6%; US -.4%. Increasing trade tensions with China (again) & more US dysfunction raised investors concerns about market resilience. Day-to-day action strongly related to Trump & thus unpredictable. Stick to long-term plan & don't try to outguess Trump.
397 2018-09-24 20:12:00 after looking at a few hundred stocks today I have come to the conclusion that some of them go up while others go down $STUDY

407 2018-09-24 20:09:33 uhh it does... find a passive investment and look through the list of stocks they invest in. The weightings are making some stocks very highly priced and other super cheap. $PPL is a good example of that in utility ETF's
408 2018-09-24 20:08:10 part of me wants to start with a small amount maybe like $400 and buy stocks again. while the other half wants to dump $5,000 in say fuck my checking account and try to ramp up my profits

414 2018-09-24 20:05:09 Okay an this is where you lose all credibility. Stop trying to compare crypto to stocks. Stocks have intrinsic value. Discounted future cash flow to value what something's currently worth. Crypto does not. Comparing these charts is illlgical and for the uneducated speculator
415 2018-09-24 20:04:16 You know it's going to come out that if this happens Trump ended up shorting a lot of key stocks to make a lot of money.

426 2018-09-24 20:00:17 I have a good amount in Real estate and about 10 percent bonds across multiple accounts. Maybe 60 -70 percent stocks overall. I’d have to look. But if the market tanks 50 percent I feel like my time is short to recoup that if we have another 2008 on our hands.

449 2018-09-24 19:48:46 The economic growth is going to stop. The reason for it, is because he gave his rich buddies tax cuts, so they are buying back stocks in their own company. It only appears as though there’s growth. I’m not a fan of any President, they’re all butchers to me.

464 2018-09-24 19:38:07 MMs do not manipulate stocks.  Micro penny stocks are not shorted.  There is no such thing as a paid basher.  Stocks go up when there are more buyers than sellers.  They go down when there are more sellers than buyers. These are the facts. #NoConspiracyTheoriesPlease

539 2018-09-24 19:02:45 It's referring to other people's folly. For instance, Warren Buffet isn't swayed by quick overnight changes in the stocks (people selling out of fear=folly). He buys when it's low and sells when it's high, period. Other people's follies make the stocks low so he can buy low.
540 2018-09-24 19:01:55 Predictably no peep out of @HindenburgRes or @capitolistpig today as BioCardia, one of the two stocks alleged to be "pumped and dumped" by Frost and $opk , today announces positive results from Phase III trial and stock skyrockets 13%.

567 2018-09-24 18:44:55 100% accurate i'm afraid. logic dictates that absolutely no one making any decisions in media is in the 48% of americans that own no stocks, funds at all. obviously the decision makers for major outlets are far wealthier than just qualifying for the upper 52% that are in market.

582 2018-09-24 18:41:45 Would be worth it if they simultaneously lowered corporate tax rate and thus made room for minor dilution annually. Otherwise meh, less government intervention. Volvo (Trucks) does have a foundation that grants stocks to (many) employees, but not forced to do so.

658 2018-09-24 18:06:15 Explain how. Did you get a massive raise? Did you sell a bunch of stocks from your portfolio?  I suspect your just making supportive statements without the worry of being exposed as lies. Statistically the "tax break" is marginal at best for the middle class.
659 2018-09-24 18:05:20 It has never broken 20C, except 2008, how can you say it will break it this time?, you always like giving fancy predictions which proved wrong most of the time,

665 2018-09-24 18:00:48 Slowly adoption increases every year, stocks aren't traded or owned by Zimbabwians  or Venezulenas. This is actual money to them that saves them from their government not another asset
666 2018-09-24 18:00:32 I don’t think anyone expects US stocks to continue to outperform here.  
667 2018-09-24 18:00:06 right now there is a huge festive sale of fundamentally strong stocks because traders want cash at any cost, they have been forced to sell their core holding to clear payments in futures and options, so they are selling everything at dirt cheap prices
668 2018-09-24 17:59:35 You compare it to stocks but stocks are already a multi trillion dollar asset. This is miniscule compared to that. Potential for growth is enormous. If makers really wanna make money they don't push it down to a price where people just wanna quit the market

Simple Avg of all the stocks since 31Jan is -21.79%
Median is -27.6%
712 2018-09-24 17:37:57 Denial; what's going to cause a sharp crash in #stocks is it's been just like the housing bubble - prices soaring while incomes near flat and many incomes of current working nil.
713 2018-09-24 17:37:33 When people talk about how much they lost in a bear market, it's only because they sold. There has never been a time in US history when stocks didn't recover. I'm not saying there won't be a time when stocks stay down; but if that happened, we'd have a lot more to worry about.

795 2018-09-24 17:04:30 I don't really think that - the algos only are doing it because companies starting doing it and then they changed the news algos to pick it up - its not the algos faults that too many BOD/CEO ramp up stocks for their own bonuses

826 2018-09-24 16:48:40 I see it's doing well, and I appreciate your thoughts, of course. I don't typically like penny stocks, as they're too easy to manipulate, and the company has a very weak pipeline with only 3 candidates. 2 of which are only P1. Halfway decent analyst support, but not much exposure

934 2018-09-24 15:59:23 Equities slide as US and China trade blows

935 2018-09-24 15:59:22 Absolutely agree, but surprised the the Fed also agrees.
You wrote: "even the Fed is now admitting stocks are so expensive that they'll likely have a zero real return over the next decade."
I'm trying to find this admission, but I can't. Can you direct me to it?

997 2018-09-24 15:31:39 DXY needs to get some momo for E&P's to gain traction to the bump in crude pricing. As out of favour stocks, they're unlikely to gain hard bids in a broadly declining mkt, that presents fear, and price opportunity in more favoured momentum equities (FANG/POT).

1043 2018-09-24 15:13:40 Oh and the free stocks can’t be sold for 3 biz days. So they’re forcing you to watch a stock and learn about it for a few days before transacting.

1046 2018-09-24 15:11:55 Dr_Stocks Tip - Momentum investing follows the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the long context investors will be essentially be buying high, but hoping to sell even higher. This methodology takes advantage of trends in a stock's price is key

1095 2018-09-24 14:51:00 I’m holding Aurora Cannabis (ACBFF) & Canopy Growth (CGC).. Tilray (TLRY) was sold (for major profits)  last week 

Oct 17th cannabis goes recreational legal in Canada, I’m suggesting to hold all CA canna stocks until then
1096 2018-09-24 14:50:57 What a start to the week for #Uranium stocks! I predict GREAT fomo as spot price continues to rise. There are still excellent companies trading at insane discounts!!
1097 2018-09-24 14:50:43 U.S. stocks lose ground, S&P 500 hits session low after Axios reports Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein to resign | via @Reuters
1098 2018-09-24 14:50:33 I have mine already, sa Trinoma bumili si boyfie as per staff, last 20pcs na lang daw. I am not sure if it’s just for today’s stocks or what.
1099 2018-09-24 14:50:19 yo no dije que el problema era de stocks. El problema cambiario es de flujos por eso necesitás más reservas. Si no estabilizas lo cambiario no alcanza con cerrar programa financiero. Por eso creo que necesitas adelantar desembolsos p cerrar programa financiero y mas reservas
1100 2018-09-24 14:49:18 Stocks are at session lows on the heels of Axios story re: Rosenstein reportedly resigning...but also important to put magnitude of move in perspective.
We're -0.5% on the day...& still within striking distance of record highs...market still pretty resilient.
1101 2018-09-24 14:49:03 Yes...There are few stocks which respect their levels ... But HDFC Twins , Big Private Banks , Auto companies are breaking their imp support levels...and this will be dangerous for us... Look at Nifty Auto Index , today it gave breakdown ..#BearishBelow10850
1102 2018-09-24 14:48:57 on friday 400 stock new 52 week low 
today 339 stock new 52 week low ...

in recent mayhem we had around same no of stocks where markets stopped falling ( not bottom read properly) 

forming a bottom and stop getting arrested are two diffrent things
1103 2018-09-24 14:48:53 But, he’s just one man. Imagine a GLOBE full of people buying an item @ $30. Now the kicks I like are a solid $80, so prices can fluctuate the income margin ALOT. The evidence is in the stocks and the people around you. Look at their feet for the beautiful swoosh mark. See truth?
1104 2018-09-24 14:48:48 We are not at the point where hdds really matter..not yet..and the po of frigid air just above the border could be enough to scare a market with very low stocks and decent tightening
1105 2018-09-24 14:48:04 shouldn't be an issue/concern when the dollar, bonds and stocks all start trading down in unison (occured in Q1)

1108 2018-09-24 14:46:43 No coincidimos. Si el problema fuera de stocks y no de flujos, la cosa habría sido distinta hace rato. Las bandas vienen después de estabilizar expectativas, cuestión que impactó en mejora de financiera. No antes. Y es más mirando la banda de abajo, que la de arriba. Saludos.

1115 2018-09-24 14:43:36 So what legislation outlawing "dangerous AND unusual" weapons has the NRA opposed? Because last I checked, they were okay with restrictions on bump stocks, which aren't even a weapon. And no, "assault rifles" are NOT unusual. A pistol grip and muzzle brake do not define unusual.

1130 2018-09-24 14:36:34 If they were selling steel pipes, the stock would be trading at $50 based on the numbers...and that is being generous. The company is lucky we remain in a bull phase for stocks and a ridiculous easy money environment.
1131 2018-09-24 14:36:20 Did a comparison of the BSE BHAV copies of 31Jan and today
Out of the total population of 2572 stocks:

1167 2018-09-24 14:26:23 From March to Aug.  NIFTY 50 moved up by 1800 points (18%) just because of  5 stocks But in Sept. down by 890 points (8%) only. whereas almost 500 stocks now below March low.  It indicates market breadth is not resilient in up move but very much desperate in down move.
1168 2018-09-24 14:24:51  have you ever looked into stocks? It’s the same sort of formula but different. Just an idea!
1169 2018-09-24 14:24:41 A new stock I like is $APTI. That could be one of the next big tech stocks in a sector that you absolutely need to include in your portfolio. Don’t get caught dragging your toes on this one.
1170 2018-09-24 14:24:28 it plays a factor but the stocks within them can still be bearish or bullish on their own.  its a factor only.  When its up people tend to buy not short.  Vice versa.  Due to tendencies it can impact the flow of the trades but its not THE flow if you know what i mean.

1174 2018-09-24 14:23:57 That means $1 invested in stocks over that time would have turned into $1.4 million while that same dollar in bonds would have become $1,599 and T-bills would be worth $263. Gold clocks in at $3.09 and if you held onto that dollar, it would now be worth 0.95 cents.
1175 2018-09-24 14:23:52 Despite continued worries over global trade, stocks rallied and both the DJIA and S&P 500 hit new record highs last week.

1177 2018-09-24 14:23:35 On average, since the early 1800’s, stocks have returned 6.7%, after inflation.

Give us an opportunity to purchase at lower price. 
Over prices and good fundamental stocks available at economical rate.
1324 2018-09-24 13:28:35 What does this mean? Stocks just lost a LOT of appeal as far as yield-hungry investors are concerned. And that's the GOOD news. The BAD news is that it's looking more and more as if the bond bubble is bursting.

1326 2018-09-24 13:28:05 The yield on the two-year Treasury is now 2.81%. The current dividend on the S&P 500 is 1.78%. Put another way, you could make more money, with less risk and volatility in Treasuries than stocks.
1327 2018-09-24 13:27:33 Knew dat crash was comin , stocks have 2 sides to make money from . It will always balance back . There really is “too much” money to be made for shit to not come bak to resistance at least once .
1328 2018-09-24 13:27:08 A large part of the move in stocks from 2008-2016 was based on the fact that bond yields were so low. By cornering the bond market, the Fed made bonds much less attractive to investors… which in turn drove investors to seek out riskier assets (like stocks) to boost returns.

1454 2018-09-24 12:15:45 It is fair - if your pension is based on stocks and shares then the fact that no more than 10% of a company’s shares are spread among their workforce won’t affect the value of your pension fund’s investment as that will depend on co performance

1605 2018-09-24 10:08:03 Makes total sense... that's why I've surrounded myself in pot stocks .
All are winners.
1606 2018-09-24 10:06:49 Interesting that both TCS and RIL were up today. Most of the fall in the Nifty came from the other stocks led by HDFC twins.
1607 2018-09-24 10:05:05 A #NAFTA deadline looms, the US Fed makes an interest rate announcement, and marijuana madness continues with pot stocks in the spotlight. At 610,  @DonnaGuzik joins me @CBCKW891 for a look ahead to the week in business.

1635 2018-09-24 09:51:35 If the shares of a company are overvalued then the investor should avoid investing in it, Investing hard-earned money in overvalued stocks exposes the investor to higher levels of risk where the potential of future appreciation is limited but the risk of losing of money is high.

1808 2018-09-24 07:08:47 Most of the MFs have large exposure in NBFCs stocks.

But if one sees long term returns they have been “quite consistent” in beating inflation. There is no alternative.

1876 2018-09-24 06:11:03 mostly vcp
but if i find any good setup like stock holding after big move, or narrow channel etc, i add to watchlist.

before doing these analyse behaviour of stock which has risen by > 500% in last 3 year.
you will get idea how & when stocks move.
1877 2018-09-24 06:10:53 I think the popular stocks come with wild swings to the upside rather than slow & steady. I prefer the stock to be quiet so I can get a good entry point. Perfect example last week was MYR, great setup on short squeeze but price action prevented good risk reward entry = No trade

1893 2018-09-24 05:58:55 Agree...but we will know the trend by Jan as that's when people would have decided. However if you value invested and your stocks have fallen it means even more value has been created. For a value investor,he sees only value and not headline index numbers.

1955 2018-09-24 05:18:29 Don't think so - most A-grade stocks are still very expensive. Long way to go on the downside if this is a structural correction or even leading to a crash.

1959 2018-09-24 05:13:54 Indices are bigger picture.  They are a overall reflection of how particular sectors are doing overall. Tech sector etc.  One compliments the other.  If it tanks - stocks within it can often tank too even if they didnt cause it, vice versa for a bull index
1960 2018-09-24 05:13:50 Do you know what companies are most overweight when comparing the GCL holdings to a market cap weighting of those same stocks? Most of these largest holdings are just the largest mrkt cap except Cameco. 3% holding of a company that would have 1% of market cap is very interesting.

1967 2018-09-24 05:11:17 There doesn't seem to be a foreseeable change in the macroeconomic policies that caused this market rout. It thus follows that any blue chip and big cap rebound is a dead cat bounce. Some of these small stocks are "zombies". @KenyaPower is suffering from low voltage.

1981 2018-09-24 05:07:03 It can happen, I have 12 stocks in my watch list and have funding for just 2 or 3. It doesn't make remaining 9 are bad buys. Portfolio construction and asset allocation plays an important role here

1992 2018-09-24 04:59:41 Well I would say get rid of those stocks as we are heading for a bigger crisis than 2008.
Debt - fiat - it’s all pretty screwed. Good luck.
1993 2018-09-24 04:58:19 Stocks reached 2013/14 levels , expectations were high  , but in reality things got worse. Rupee falling every day , crude going up , interest going up , rising unemployment and corruption .Only a strong , educated leadership can take economy to next level.
1994 2018-09-24 04:56:05 And how would that Token buy back work? These are not stocks we are holding. Admittedly, I am far from an expert on these things.
1995 2018-09-24 04:54:56 That’s fine. I just think it’s a good hedge against global recession - nothing more.

2012 2018-09-24 04:36:03 This is so stupid and so misleading.

I think Nike is stupid for doing this drew a line. Stocks go up and down.  Has nothing to do with Trumps “rejection” or more like “lack of rejection”. His supporters continue to grow. 

Sorry, but Trump’s around to a while. Get used to it.
2013 2018-09-24 04:35:58 When banks are lending 10 times loans over promoters holding land & above that no expertise with promoters means you sunk, you are sinking & will sink with such approach.

2015 2018-09-24 04:34:38 In general , you are right. But if you are talking w.r.t what happened on Friday. I think, the news channels had no fault, they didnt spread any rumuors, the stocks were falling & then they covered it,in fact they got the managment on air & cleared things up.
2016 2018-09-24 04:34:21 Just read now.. to be honest, I don't completely understand how the bond market works. But what I feel is that before 2019 elections, the equity market will be very volatile. I would be looking to buy stocks of good companies during this time

2019 2018-09-24 04:32:40 What life teaches is, you can make mistake first time but never next time. However, the laws are not being whet to ensure there are no repetition. 99% loans risky because plant, stocks, houses, cars, mobiles, businessmen everything is on loans.  "Nitin Sandesara"

2022 2018-09-24 04:31:11 In the event of a Venezuela-esque crisis, you said stocks will go up in nominal terms. How would you go about deciding if that is a good investment or a bad one being that the dollar will be depreciating?
2023 2018-09-24 04:30:59 Sure, but then if you divert the revenue towards letting people buy stocks, it seems like the deficit would grow

2028 2018-09-24 04:26:58 1. Bounceback are not bottoms
2. Rise in risk perception will increase cost of capital across industries. This will play out over quarters and reflect in earnings. 
3. Steer clear of rumours and unconfirmed news source. 
4. Macro troubles haven't gone away

2034 2018-09-24 04:23:27 Yeah, I'd definitely say so. During the first match I thought this was going to be an example of losing, but doing it well. By the last match you could see your defense adaptations where you'd lost stocks previously to the same moves. The confidence level was boosted as well. GG
2035 2018-09-24 04:23:17 Just saying that this habit of waiting for a ‘close’ below SL will trouble your portfolio when market takes a massive U Turn which will come sooner or later.

2201 2018-09-24 01:44:26 From our IRAs and Joint Brokerage which I manage and invest in individual stocks.

So far, that has been true...by far. Almost 4x the return of our 401k which is in an S&P500 index.

Scenario likely isn't common, but that survey leaves out IRAs and Non retirement accounts.
2202 2018-09-24 01:43:17 I realize as an investor in stocks and previously in my life commodities... charts and formations, all make a difference. But, company fundamentals, use case, length of and progress toward your project's purpose, also matter.

Facts are facts. Nobody I know is doing better.
Stocks are up because of buy backs caused by the tax scam.

2208 2018-09-24 01:40:30 They trade CFDs (contract for difference), you dont trade shares. They take the other side of all of your trades. I dont have an account but know a few people that do. The downsides are no low priced stocks (none < $2-3 ) and you can only buy on the ask and sell on the bid.

2213 2018-09-24 01:34:47 Anyone who thinks the economy is good or great must think that stocks and GDP have some magical representative correlation to high wage jobs, a decrease in poverty, and better access to goods and services.

They aren't. It isn't. Not for 99% of people.
2214 2018-09-24 01:33:28 Moe @Donna987654321 Get a clue the goverment raises taxes for various needs. So the taxpayers pay 4 or 5 things on their paychecks. You pay the feds 2 things only get 1 back. While they play with it in stocks and bonds to increase what they got paid, you'll never see the other.

2229 2018-09-24 01:24:12 will get even richer? Trump and the 1% bc they’ll buy up all the stocks and goods that I sincerely doubt you are any part of. If you were, you wouldn’t be running your mouth about how good your 401k is.
2230 2018-09-24 01:24:09 I think you can easily make the argument that the barriers to stocks is high. Since 2008, the middle class is incredibly hesistant to hold them.

2254 2018-09-24 00:54:28 I agree there are a lot of stocks on the OTC that are garbage, but not 99.9%.  I also made some money on that exchange. But I find that the problem on the OTC is more the people than the stock. All this bashing and pushing is no good for any stock.
2255 2018-09-24 00:54:07 Hrmm I wonder how many people that burnt their Nikes are now buying mine Nike stocks?
2256 2018-09-24 00:54:06 Go long on Diary stocks.
2257 2018-09-24 00:52:47 also MFs sell low + buy high often? which is the opposite you want to do (should be buying stocks when the market is down!). also allows you to be in control of dollar-cost averaging
2258 2018-09-24 00:51:51 ~essentially~ managed MFs try to get higher returns based on historic avgs + put/pull from market based on trends + get you with fees & turnover taxes from buying/selling. buying total indexes of US + intl stocks + bonds means you'll get better avgs long term + less fees
