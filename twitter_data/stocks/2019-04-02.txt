3 2019-04-02 23:56:50 we bubble & crash together with stocks ??
4 2019-04-02 23:56:18 There is a tangent between lower drug prices & decreased annual revenue for any of the drug chains ... so their forecasts probably will show lowered expectations & in turn a potential downgrade of their stocks ...
5 2019-04-02 23:55:36 top stocks to watch for DT's tomorrow $RIOT $SAEX $DCAR. $FUV nice from swing list, $SRNE terrible arrgghh. $FFHL, $NM, $ABIL hanging there
6 2019-04-02 23:55:13 Tending to overtrade so perhaps should take only the super-good setups 
Or maybe not taking good enough stocks. I usually focus on those who have had a Power Earnings Gap and wait for them to create a bullish pattern or stabilise around an EMA line
7 2019-04-02 23:55:12 Been in the library all day trying to work on my finance project and I just can’t keep focus. Computing the STEYX on all these stocks has me fiending for some #STEAKS. Specially, #OmahaSteaks. I really should’ve warned my prof about their addictiveness before he assigned this

10 2019-04-02 23:52:09 New Smash mini game: the goal is not to win, but to get as much percent on your opponent as possible before you lose all three stocks, or before time runs out. If they die before the game ends, whatever percent they were on is no longer valid. They must stay alive.
11 2019-04-02 23:51:15 connor if you do 3 stocks I will KILL MYSELF

12 2019-04-02 23:50:17 Nice day for trading crypto related stocks for sure
13 2019-04-02 23:49:28 No; I don't - stocks don't always go down after lockup expiration. There are so many things one can look at - volume, lockup, ER etc - I keep things simple and only pay attention to the business, its prospects and valuation.
14 2019-04-02 23:47:51 For me “entry signals and portfolio management” first. What made you focus (and have a position) on the stocks you post about? 
I am in the stage of identifying good and super-good setups technically but I am missing something.
