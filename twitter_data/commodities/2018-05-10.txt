1 2018-05-10 23:58:21 This is not quite the same. After oil/commodities prices came sharply down, the Malay government imposed tax. It is the tax that brought incumbent down. In India GST simplifies the transport of good across India as it has one tax. Fo no worries.
2 2018-05-10 23:54:59 Agree, but I would also say food security is an issue that transcends day-to-day politics. Countries that purchase agriculture commodities are already seeking more reliable trading partners or boosting domestic production.

This industry needs to protect it’s workers, especially the more vulnerable ones. They are people, not commodities.
40 2018-05-10 21:36:00 The growth was as result increase in the prices of oil which does not translate to increase in jobs.the country  needs to diversify their economy by adding value to their primary commodities like gold,iron,aluminum ,timber ,cocoa etc.most Africa countries records high GDP growth

43 2018-05-10 21:12:07 The only sector that is really surprising me right now is the materials. The commodities are at new highs and the energy sector is about to make a new high, but materials sector is really under performing S&P 500 Index. $XLB $SPX
44 2018-05-10 20:57:46 Wesley, é muito pessoal essa escolha. O “valer”  é muito relativo. Gosto de Vale e Petro. Tente entender os ciclos das commodities. @hbredda fala muito bem sobre eles. Desta forma conseguirá tirar boas conclusões.
45 2018-05-10 20:49:56 Examples of this strategy are common, having normally
been implemented by huge corporations with commodities they operate their
core businesses on. The textbook examples of this are De Beers and the global
diamond supply, or Standard Oil and the US oil supply. #OptiToken
46 2018-05-10 20:47:37 caramba, será que vale entrar ainda em commodities?
47 2018-05-10 20:45:50 A car is a privilege, but a gun is a right? So, you can walk into a gun store, state your right, take whatever you wish, and walk out? Or maybe you have to go to your gov't offices for that?
Both are market commodities. And any car is 1000x more useful than any gun.
48 2018-05-10 20:41:42 The system that forces the rich to get richer and the poor to stay poor isn’t solely capitalism.

When you use money you accumulated through your own work to make commodities like transportation cheaper, that’s a good thing. As a businessman, Elon has taken many financial risks
49 2018-05-10 20:40:24 You should study the Coase Theorem, stop thinking commodities are in unlimited amount, and realise your overconsumtion is killing millions of people, destroying the whole ecosystem. Grow up . You are childish

51 2018-05-10 20:36:41 Mmm oil has been rising for quite awhile. Has risen a whole 1.30 since Trump stated the deal is dead. I trade commodities so I know exactly what is going on. We're you crying when has was 4+ at the pumps during PART of Obamas presidency or is this just more selective outrage?
52 2018-05-10 20:32:21 Tommie, would you like me to provide you with the data on gas prices during the Obama years?  Stop crying, commodities fluctuate, always have, always will.
53 2018-05-10 20:27:24 Self checkouts and robotic workers not only eliminate jobs, but have other negative impacts on economies. An employee contributes to the local economy by buying or renting a home, a car, furniture, food and other commodities that a machine doesn't.
54 2018-05-10 20:16:19 Future scholars are going to find my tomb in this office and assume these are three most important commodities from this era. Not wrong either.
55 2018-05-10 20:13:24 Indeed, Nitzan & Bichler argue that there isn’t really a difference—all economic action is political, and aims to both contribute to the ‘economic pie’ AND change the size of one’s ‘slice’ lol. Rents & profits reduce to power relations over socially determined commodities.

57 2018-05-10 20:07:06 Always counts :)

Truthfully, I still see the same story w/ China slowing & US beginning to slow. We can creep along like this for a while until the banks begin to tighten their lending standards & commodities roll over (like oil & copper). Slowly working on a post about it
58 2018-05-10 20:04:59 Is this farmland being seized by imminent domain? If not, I don't see how you can argue a farmer shouldn't sell to a developer for more $ than it's worth to farm. There's an oversupply of commodities & depressed prices as it is.

63 2018-05-10 19:33:28 It's a nice idea, but try broadening this perspective. Like being able to buy crates from merchants and each merchant will give you a certain price for your merch, in addition to the voyages. Also adding more commodities like you said.

69 2018-05-10 19:04:23 U cannot reduce the efforts of this government to just the prices of commodities or things. 

There are different factors u need to put into consideration... 
Recession is one of them, oil prices. 

With time, these prices will come further down....
70 2018-05-10 18:43:43 With Samsung and other Japanese companies working on Bitcoin ASICs that future is very possible. Crypto currencies are vulnerable now because they are in the early stages. Eventually $crypto will be the norm and ASIC chips will be commodities made by everyone.
71 2018-05-10 18:35:17 I do see value in cryptocurrency linked to reality like gold or basket of commodities (CRB), etc. but not based on a flawed maths formula as today. Present bitcoin as flawed as dollar since 1971.

85 2018-05-10 17:38:32 o boom das commodities gerou a doença holandesa brasileira. Supervaloriza o real, torna a indústria menos competitiva e impossibilita qualquer setor que não seja o agronegócio de prosperar.
86 2018-05-10 17:32:40 Por que mascarado? Porque os preços das nossas commodities (agronegocio, mineração, petroleo) tudo com preço super faturado. Quando chega no final do primeiro Governo da Dilma esses preços caem abruptamente forçando uma desvalorização enorme do real ao dolar. Aí a crise.
87 2018-05-10 17:22:37 When markets and commodities go up in tandem, it makes me worry a bit less about my bond fund declines........i am still long term bullish on bonds, and i think this is a weakness that should be bought as opposed to sold.........yields will go negative during next downturn

94 2018-05-10 16:43:37 120 million people are victims of high value!!
Prices of some essential commodities, including rice, have risen in 2017. Despite the increase in the per capita income in the country last year, it has not received any benefit of 12 million people of low and middle income!!

96 2018-05-10 16:33:23 Ok. You were talking about the past. Well, based on that, everywhere was been developed.  And I don’t think petrodollars was the main source of $ then. the country was still a major exporter of other commodities during that era. I bet price and vol of crude were not that material
97 2018-05-10 16:31:48 True because miners can’t respond to lack of demand and restrict supply, unlike other commodities bitcoin is more cartel proof. I like the mining cost is near the price floor theory. If it ever gets there, I will buy heavily.

108 2018-05-10 16:10:15 Of course not. Are you being intentionally dense to try and make a point?

Prices of commodities fluctuate all the time. Brexit is likely to increase the prices in the UK. It's all there in the article.

110 2018-05-10 16:03:50 Y si no te "moriste de hambre" fue porque en esa época también estaba el boom de los commodities con la soja a precios irreales, casi 700 dólares la tonelada y la plata entraba a raudales. ESO SE TERMINÓ y la regaladera de dinero, en algun momento hay que pagarla
111 2018-05-10 16:03:48 @realDonaldTrump I'm convinced we are being scammed by high oil prices.  I hate nationalization of any comsumable, but it's time for price controls on oil!  They do it with commodities like grains.  Why not oil?
112 2018-05-10 16:02:26 No sé porqué dudo mucho de esa percepción...Los TLC han sido diseñados por la OMC para favorecer los intereses de sus principales socios. A los países del tercer mundo se les ha asignado la función de ser proveedores de commodities y compradores de bienes y servicios...

117 2018-05-10 15:46:48 Sim, nesse sentido o boom das commodities fez o governo querer se aproveitar do crescimento "fácil" (e quando pensou em investir em infraestrutura pensou no setor errado, petróleo, que demanda MUITO investimento e de longo prazo, sem garantia de retorno)
118 2018-05-10 15:44:49 Óbvio que as commodities ajudaram bem (e minha mágoa eterna do Lula é paralelamente ao que já havia não investir pesadamente além do consumo) (e  Lula 2 e a farra das empreiteiras é a raiz de todos os nossos males atuais)

Trading commodities enables you to participate in broad market moves or within specialized sectors.
175 2018-05-10 12:36:12 trading has exploded. Commodities have now emerged as a separate asset class, helping investors to diversify their portfolios.
176 2018-05-10 12:36:09 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.

234 2018-05-10 07:03:13 That wouldn't go against Sraffa since he only says how the price systems works. This goes against KM who consciently simplifies (ch. 9, volume III Capital) the relations between commodities value and price. In chapter 50, he shows his undertanding of prices/wages/profit relation.

Dal prices have crashed -compare price of arhar in 2016 (Rs 150 to Rs 180 per kg) &now Rs 70 - Rs 80. Low price is a key factor behind farm crisis.

276 2018-05-10 02:42:01 .@Go_Rozen has some of the best research I've found on why to be bullish commodities (and especially oil) over that time frame (and longer).
277 2018-05-10 02:41:53 There's no such thing as a secure computer system. There used to be, but once they became commodities, security went out the window.
278 2018-05-10 02:39:44 He also supports child marriage in African countries. He thinks that it is colonial oppression to have protections that stop 12 year old girls from poor families, being sold to wealthy old men. The rabbit hole gets deeper and it ends up with children as commodities.

290 2018-05-10 01:26:17 He’s never been a tech guy or speculator. He invests in companies that he can control. He does not speculate on currencies or commodities, which are wildly different and much more similar to Crypto. Bitcoin is more like gold imo.
291 2018-05-10 01:26:04 I still think #Copper $HG_F is going to be one of the best trades long for 2018. With commodities like #Oil moving higher, stocks moving higher, and cmdty currencies itching to move higher ( like $CAD ) - there is a lot of potential catalysts once "infrastructure" picks up again.
292 2018-05-10 01:18:34 Maybe a few Canadian #Natgas names that will pull through this downturn. Going to be a tough year with AECO/Nova prices in the dumps, but like most commodities, when everyone is calling for the death of a sector, usually the time to be a contrarian and buying. #OOTT
293 2018-05-10 01:17:54 Buffett does make a fair point that commodities are not value producing assets and thus in his opinion, are not as good an investment as a business, farm, etc. However, even if BTC is like a commodity, most altcoins are similar to stocks, they just happen to spend like currency.
294 2018-05-10 01:14:52 You nailed it Molly. We sound like a whole nation of people still learning to be humane.

296 2018-05-10 01:11:08 Unfortunately, Russia is on the road to regain hard power through ressources. 
As the West was incapable of making a real ecological transition, oil is back on historical expensive trends as are many commodities where Russia is / will be a giant.
Russia is rich thus poweful.

303 2018-05-10 00:42:24 and it’s drawing the 
attention of market participants attempting to assess its significance. The coordinated run-up is rare because a stronger 
dollar makes commodities priced in the currency more expensive to users of other currencies.
