133 2018-10-18 22:28:36 I can think of one: tax-loss selling. When that is dealt with, these stocks will find a bid, and fast. Mean reversion will be very profitable to those who put their chips down at the right time.

159 2018-10-18 22:13:46 From  what I've heard charging more than what you let people borrow is wrong and investing with stocks is OK. That's what I read on that Zippy Catholic blog (I cant remember the name of the blog but it was very conservative from what I was told about it)
160 2018-10-18 22:11:09 I dont know .. but in true "risk off" when stocks plummet .. BTC will most likely go down too
161 2018-10-18 22:11:00 EOTP-dem-inspired media hits Trump hard when stocks fall, oil prices go up, or the 'debt' runs at not even half of Obamas...  But have these things move the opposite direction, and 'shhhh'... you might only hear nancy pelosi's  gavel-to-be  go, 'thud'... COMPETENT as she is.

183 2018-10-18 21:58:32 Here’s the real scam trading with a normal broker 

1. Worrying about market makers stopping you out 

2. Slippage 

3. Partially filled 

4. Pre borrowing hard to borrow stocks and Paying 3-10 cents per share just to borrow the shares

CFDs solves all these problems.
184 2018-10-18 21:58:22 It wouldn’t be a $BTC day at @CNBCFastMoney without @BKBrianKelly aka #LyinBrian telling me to pour my grandma’s money into cryptos!

185 2018-10-18 21:58:11 Stocks still in an uptrend...or rolling over into downtrend?  Not convinced as everyone and their mothers looking for higher prices out 3-6-12 months. Everyone (herd).

207 2018-10-18 21:42:12 Oh, THIS guy. "DJ D-Sol" typifies everything rotten about late capitalism. 1) Classic head-in-sand "EVERYTHING'S FINE!" pre-bust rhetoric, completely ignoring suspiciously high bond yields matched with lower stocks and persistently stagnant wages. But far more importantly, 2)...
208 2018-10-18 21:41:44 Oh god, enough with that already. How long are you going to keep waiting for this Trickle Down Method fairytale to start happening?

This money turns into CEO salaries, and stock buybacks. Stocks, which 84% of are owned by 10% of families. It's a sham. Open your eyes already.
209 2018-10-18 21:41:32 Its hard to walk off the desk for sure and sucks but glad you took some - stocks are just so emotional and yes oil and gas can to but for most part not as bigger herd to compete with :)

So you could certainly buy a second house if that’s what you wanted.

254 2018-10-18 21:17:58 Many stocks are in bear market. One of the hardest lessons one can learn in this is picking stocks in a bear market is almost impossible. For one, you have to know what the next bull market leadership will be, typically not the same as the previous bull market.
255 2018-10-18 21:16:28 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
256 2018-10-18 21:15:09 And so it begins.  this $hit is gonna kill my stocks I just know it.

259 2018-10-18 21:13:51 I really like your services.  You have provided me a lot of good investment advice.  But, I really wish you would stop comparing so many stocks to Amazon.   There may never be another Amazon.  Stop over-promising.

262 2018-10-18 21:12:45 #auspol New PM Morrison has placed all Sharma’s stocks in the so-called 13% Jewish vote. However Wentworth, like the rest of Australia, is not divided on racial or religious lines. 100% of Wentworthians will make up their own minds. #WentworthByElection #WentworthVotes
263 2018-10-18 21:12:44 A belt loop does the same thing as a bump stocks. So we should all wear pants without belt loops by the logic of bump stocks.
264 2018-10-18 21:11:31 I just put down like 10 bucks to start. That was about a month and a half ago. But it actually started to acquire some money on top of what I put down. I’ve never done stocks or anything like that so again, I was pretty skeptical.
265 2018-10-18 21:11:11 @CNBCFastMoney.  ...please explain the effects of zero % credit affecting overleveraged stocks?
266 2018-10-18 21:10:01 historical mid-term chart show big ralles after election but the months before were weak. Not what happened this year, new all time highs in the summer and for NQ (techs) at the beginning of October.  Some stocks have already eaten into year end gains, I'd avoid those.
267 2018-10-18 21:09:07 i wanna invest in some stocks

273 2018-10-18 21:05:29 @TheAroraReport Your article on losing 90% of your investments in marijuana stocks was so bogus. Are you short on MJ stocks?8 billion in weed sales 3 of which will be illegal?Where did you get that stat from? Are you trying to get stocks on the cheap?Short!
274 2018-10-18 21:05:01 Equities will probably peak a bit later in 2019, not least because the Nov-April period tends to be seasonally strong for stocks, especially after midterm elections. That will be the rally to sell. By the end of Q2 next year, I expect risk-off everywhere. —-#scottminerd

286 2018-10-18 20:57:48 Look for reversal patterns on stocks that are only selling off from the overall market. When the market is this choppy you may get a day or two on the trade. Longer term trades I am not focused on.

294 2018-10-18 20:54:38 Stocks traded lower Thursday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven  Mnuchin announced that he won't attend an investor conference in Saudi  Arabia, joining several business leaders who also dropped out.

299 2018-10-18 20:51:50 However, I've looked on our system and Ware Superstore is the closest store that stocks this beer. You could also go to the Customer Service desk and do a stock request for this item? I hope this helps :) TY - Elaine 2/2
300 2018-10-18 20:51:18 Well I think trading stocks are high risk even though I do a little myself. If you are beating the market great for you but most people can’t so at least getting the market return in an index fund is the best option

308 2018-10-18 20:48:35 It was shit , they never mentioned the dilution of gene stocks from farmed escapees spawning with wild stock and a small mention of lice , it was a vulgar cover up attempt and I’d like to kick the editor square in the fucking teeth 
309 2018-10-18 20:47:17 Oh “don’t worry guys there will be restocks in different days so every everyone has a chance” to not get one because your site has no type of monitor/bot protection, and you have very small stocks, don’t give notifications.. and come out at random times in the day

320 2018-10-18 20:40:38 Let me tell you a story about undervalued Canadian oil stocks
321 2018-10-18 20:40:37 The reason that Investopedia and other economic sites intermix the two is because worth/value live in the same world when it comes to most tangible assets. For instance stocks. Stocks have both worth and value, one in the same.

But in a hobby, they are two separate definitions
322 2018-10-18 20:40:24 bought some $PURA today at $.13 to get into the marijuana beverage game. don’t usually do penny stocks, but it’s more fun than buying a lottery ticket.

334 2018-10-18 20:35:48 The biggest factor on investment returns might be costs. Try to keep your costs as low as possible. Trading stocks just makes your broker richer with the commissions you pay. And with an index fund you benefit from its diversification.
335 2018-10-18 20:35:25 Not going to move out of the very few stocks I have, until I see a bounce first. 

Worst case, I hold them indefinitely. I never buy with money that may be needed within several years.
336 2018-10-18 20:35:15 Shouldn’t this raise stocks

347 2018-10-18 20:30:09 I did not say the tax cuts were artificial.  I said the market was artificially inflated due to tax cut money for companies being pumped back into the market by buying stocks in their own companies that got the cuts. Please read what I said.

354 2018-10-18 20:26:59 I didn't get into pot stocks .. but I got into MG and LNR and OSB at their recent peaks a few weeks ago and since then, the market has decided their future earnings will be crushed in an upcoming depression.
355 2018-10-18 20:26:36 If $PYPL can’t go higher on great numbers, a lot of stocks that miss this earnings season are likely  going to get absolutely demolished.
356 2018-10-18 20:26:11 World stocks fall: US -1.4%; Europe -.5%. Investors realizing all is not perfect. China trade tensions, rising bond yields, Saudi issues, slowing global growth. This isn't market for non-professional short-term traders. Long-term a good bet but be prepared for lots of volatility.
357 2018-10-18 20:26:07 Soon as brexit hits I’m buying mad stocks

360 2018-10-18 20:25:08 So do you consider the trend line as major resistance? I have tried and failed at buying breakouts so would appreciate your take
361 2018-10-18 20:25:04 All penny stocks are on fire and i'm sitting here chasing tops. Red day with FOMO and trading company but not the chart.
362 2018-10-18 20:24:23 Anytime. Pot stocks are extremely volatile. I've gained/lost as much as a few thousand in a day. Proceed with caution.
363 2018-10-18 20:23:46 I think it's a bit rough to judge one bad game over 3-4 years of fantasy relevance. Lachie Neale and Trent Cochin have been held to 9 disposals before and hasn't impacted their fantasy stocks.
364 2018-10-18 20:22:55 Only the low debt companies (rare), otherwise stocks/bonds go down together. Borrowers on a decade long debt binge who have eliminated equity from their balance sheets will be obliterated if central banks let significant air out of the bond bubble.
365 2018-10-18 20:22:02 U.S. stocks closed far lower Thursday,10/18/18: $DJIA -1.27% at 25,379.45, $SPX -1.44% at 2,768.78, $COMPQ -2.06% at 7,485.14, $RUT -1.82% at $1560.75.
366 2018-10-18 20:21:40 Okay but is your man investing in stocks?
367 2018-10-18 20:21:17 Good example = pirate stocks. EB forget many paragraphs of ASXLR say...... " and at the discretion of ASX"
368 2018-10-18 20:20:30 Float is 27m, inst owners 65%, so we have roughly 9m stocks outstanding, daily volume is 10x. I think there’s high probably of skyrocketing 
369 2018-10-18 20:19:40 I personally think of multi day break outs as a move up over the major resistance level. That was I get a safer entry - less risk, more upside.
370 2018-10-18 20:18:45 Are you high? Stocks have been flat for the last year. The Dow is lower today than it was January 1. Record deficits, no wage growth. Yes, vote, please.

372 2018-10-18 20:18:30 Republicans are doing what they do best: Gaslighting. 

Remember when they told us that tax cuts to corporations and the rich would filter down??? Corporations are spending their money on stock buy-backs worth Trillions and the rich are buying stocks. 

No trickle down at all.
373 2018-10-18 20:18:18 I see the stocks are tanking again. Must be your fault.
374 2018-10-18 20:17:41 My thinking is if you're going to trade market stocks you might as well trade the /NQ futures ... more liquid, more leveraged.
375 2018-10-18 20:16:07 Do you considering shares float when analyzing stocks?
376 2018-10-18 20:15:38 Nice to see @fincannacapital having a good day on the markets. $CALI Maybe showing sentiment for U.S. stocks next week.

378 2018-10-18 20:15:18 I think he’s trolling the idea that WEED stocks are the new CRYPTO. Certainly more volatile than crypto a present!

388 2018-10-18 20:12:55 Being discharged from the Marines, mixed emotions about it, but as one door closes, a lot more open. My advice to anyone wanting to go into the military, make sure it's what you want. If you're not 150% sure, don't sign. Now to focus on trading micro/small cap stocks
389 2018-10-18 20:12:22 True, but big run already. Potential sell the news on pot related stocks as well after Canada legalize. Good sign most are holding in the mkt. Need a new catalyst for next leg up.

391 2018-10-18 20:11:43 #EURUSD  Can you see the Price dropping ? Any Questions.Yes, it scared almost everyone... GL If the feds cant control this drop on bonds on the daily chart, then it means bullish for DX and Bearish for stocks and Eur-Usd.
392 2018-10-18 20:11:19 Of the stocks I follow, the only ones positive are tobacco, oil refiners, auto parts retailers.  I don't know what that means, but there you go anyway.
393 2018-10-18 20:11:07 It's the Latin term for stocks with or without dividend. That's how the deals were offically called 
394 2018-10-18 20:10:43 Buy stocks.
395 2018-10-18 20:10:22 I think what we all want in the biotech/pharma market is to find stocks like $AMRN or $PTI. At the moment I have two catalyst plays in the PF. $ONCS & $AVEO. Loads of insider buys, loads of positivity from mgmt prior to these catalysts in Oct. and Nov. Hope they'll deliver great!
396 2018-10-18 20:10:10 Renewed heavy selling leaves stocks broadly lower. Dow ends -327, -1.3% to 25,379. S&P -1.4%, Nasdaq -2.1%.

Why? Take your pic: Bad earnings, Saudi murderers, Europe economy fears, US rate concerns.

Or just: "I've made a lot of $$$ in this bull mkt and I'm taking a few profits"
397 2018-10-18 20:09:31 What's everybody's opinion on Third Point and their attempt on the takeover of $CPB? Love to hear everyone's thoughts. #stocks #dividends #RefreshTheRecipe #StockMarket #stockstowatch

399 2018-10-18 20:09:16 You know why? Rules. Those things that we're supposed to hate. The FTSE won't allow them to remain listed if they don't have HQ in the UK, and all those institutional investors will have to sell from all the funds that are FTSE stocks.
400 2018-10-18 20:08:17 The entire narrative on @teamcavuto is moronic. Defense stocks were down less than the rest of the market. You realize how stupid these people are always finding "reason" for market gyrations. The Saudis killed a guy. They kill people every day.
401 2018-10-18 20:08:15 Yes, but... In past meaningful p/backs stocks did take lead, but near to what proved to be the eventual bottom of the p/back, IG CDX showed +ve divergence, AND there was a surge in bond issuance. Tdy issuance actually looks good, so that's in + column $SPY $QQQ $IWM

403 2018-10-18 20:07:35 Stocks down inflation threatening .... who’s driving this economy? Does he know what he’s doing or was all that great talk talk just a GREAT BIG bluff?
404 2018-10-18 20:07:34 Yes but they have become laughing stocks in the process @JSchanzer
405 2018-10-18 20:07:18 US stocks is likely near the end of its bull run (at least in the medium term), and cryptomarkets appear to be close to ending their bear run. My money's on crypto.

429 2018-10-18 19:57:03 It's a tough day for uranium stocks generally, which are feeling pressure from the broad market sell-off, even as the spot price of uranium moves higher. $UUUU $URG $FCUUF $CCJ and more.
430 2018-10-18 19:56:50 What else can happen? Chinese stocks buying opportunity of a decade
431 2018-10-18 19:56:24 Many stocks like $BNS could resolve into double bottoms, but the % stocks under the 200 day ma is high, as well as failed breakouts, so I don’t think it makes sense to bet on that. We’ll just have to wait. Zzzzz.
432 2018-10-18 19:55:57 Wealthy people don’t take income above $3M. Most compensation is stocks & capital gains- these assets aren’t counted for ‘Income Tax’ as used by this propaganda shop.

452 2018-10-18 19:40:49 The price increase from stock buybacks is no more artificial than the lemmings and bots driving the prices anyother time. In an ideal situation the value of the stock taken out of cirulation equals or is lower than the net gain in remaining outstanding stocks.

460 2018-10-18 19:37:26 Buying back their own stock to reduce the outstanding shares or paying higher dividends are two ways companies spend their profits. Stock buybacks benefit shortterm shareholders who can sell off stocks for short term capital gains. Higher dividends benefit long term investors

515 2018-10-18 19:18:25 Well, maybe now. I'm not at my desk, but housing stocks peaked in Feb and never rejoined the $SPX to new highs.

#housing data began to slide in March. #Lumber peaks in May - the same time total construction peaked and rolled from an all-time high. Fall likely demand related.
516 2018-10-18 19:18:16 I’m sure you & Jim are running like crazy with this market today. Great AAP Monthly Call. Gives me some comfort to know I have good stocks even though . Bought 50 of Jim’s special. Don’t forget to eat like my hubby on his crazy busy days

528 2018-10-18 19:14:08 Still, a flat tax would be much better for the wealthy than for the average person, because the wealthy would still have ample money to invest in stocks or whatever, increasing wealth! The average would most likely put the rest toward bills, etc. instead of SAVING!!!

531 2018-10-18 19:12:17 Lots of news stories are being blamed for today's sell-off in stocks.  The reality is the market likely would have sold off today even if none of those stories took place.  Bear markets don't need excuses to fall, but investors who don't know they're in one always look for one!
532 2018-10-18 19:11:59 Voting Red all the way! Reason why = good economy, no nukes pointed at us, unemployment low, stocks up, Russia and China both at the table, and just because I remember the last eight years. Oh and ISIS is a thing of the past without Obama's funding. Nothing else matters.

574 2018-10-18 18:58:39 It's a booming economy because of the central banks buying up stocks, and thus inflating the "value" of companies.

Malls in southern southern cali are packed though.
575 2018-10-18 18:58:28 Food for thought, had your put $1000 bucks into the FANG stocks in the late 1980's, it would be worth well over 1 million today. When you think of that in context, that could potentially beat out any active day trader?

577 2018-10-18 18:58:05 My guess is Wall Street will be aggressively pushing people to buy stocks until the midterms.  Wall Street supports trump and republicans.  With other analysts warning about stocks because of trade wars and HUGE stock market decline in China, markets should be volatile
578 2018-10-18 18:57:06 Gotten three equity market strategy pieces today, with different opinions as follows.

2) Sell

609 2018-10-18 18:43:55 >> Stocks are automatically protected against currency inflation or collapse.  But if you think that they are too risky, or can't afford to research the company, you can invest in bonds or diversified investment funds, which give a smaller return but muck smaller risk.

648 2018-10-18 18:28:23 Random music recommendation. Has nothing to do with stocks. Just happen to be listening to it while I put together story ideas for next week. And Nothing Happened by Spiritualized is amazing. Well worth the wait. Damaged is an incredible song. #spacerock Now, back to the music.
649 2018-10-18 18:27:41 I was referring to the fact that it was FALLING as stocks and USD/JPY were dumping to LODs at the same time despite many asserting that the decline in stocks was the reason for #Gold's rally which it obviously is not. I have no time for fools projecting anyway.
650 2018-10-18 18:27:18 It is scary, but we need to be smart about it, & protect our own interests. Sell stocks, put it in cash. Look for opportunities to buy gold. Do not take out an equity loan using your home as collateral. If you already have one, try to pay it off ASAP. Watch credit card interest.

669 2018-10-18 18:17:05 Hard to know. If/when we get the ~30% crash in stocks, that'll be deflationary for commodities. If/when the #Fed reverses policy, then we "know" the bottom is in place.

695 2018-10-18 18:09:49 .Yankee stocks fell on Thursday as weak earnings reports from industrials raised worries about rising expenses and the impact of #tariffs, adding to concerns over higher borrowing costs after hawkish commentary in the Federal Reserve's minutes.
696 2018-10-18 18:09:42 I may need to experiment before current stocks run down too far. Hook and loop I had before was pretty dreadful compared with cloth backed 406. And I mean from the cutting perspective. Put me off.

709 2018-10-18 18:05:44 Actually, fact is, the stock market has been artificially inflated due to the huge corporate tax breaks by this administration and those corporations buying back their own stocks. The market cannot sustain this for long. It's going to crash... soon.

721 2018-10-18 18:01:23 the underlying socio-political bent of the Moon Jae-in admin is not necessarily favourable to stocks near-term ex-Trump, but Trump trade issues and NK rapprochement (which was on its way w/o Trump) may temper the admin’s natural policy tendencies.

729 2018-10-18 17:57:13 Since mid-2016 cash-rich stocks have outperformed cash-poor stocks by around 40% - I wonder how much of this has been down to their greater ability to buy back their own stock??

750 2018-10-18 17:51:38 Among the reasons for stock selling on Thursday, according to investors, were concerns about the China trade war, a jump in bond yields in Italy and lingering worries about possible overvalued U.S. tech stocks.

771 2018-10-18 17:45:41 Overconfidence has most effected my investing, also representativeness.  I choose small sample size to make forecast, and always hold my believes of stocks trend, sometime the reality trend is totally different. #rpiFTI

785 2018-10-18 17:42:53 According to Trump and fans, as long as stocks continue to go up unemployment goes down, and stacking of the courts, nothing else matters. Everything else is acceptable collateral damage, including children in concentration camps, corruption, and taking away social safety nets
786 2018-10-18 17:42:40 stock market is pricing in a slowdown in the economy and peak earnings...i dont believe it but that is what stocks are saying and saying pretty loud...also pricing in policy error by fed...no surprise the fed are  morons

805 2018-10-18 17:36:07 #American stocks fell on Thursday as weak earnings reports from industrials raised worries about rising expenses and the impact of tariffs, adding to concerns over higher borrowing costs after hawkish commentary in the #FederalReserve's minutes.
806 2018-10-18 17:35:54 STOCKS decline as investors focus on trump & republican trade wars. GOP economic policies caused GIGANTIC declines in the China stock market (down over 20%) & Europe (down over 10%).  Who is going to lend USA $$ to fund MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICIT caused by Tax Cuts for Billionaires.
807 2018-10-18 17:35:52 Someone needs to check into the manipulation of the stock markets! When there is the wide swings we are seeing, there has got to be a conspiracy between brokerage houses!!! You can't make me believe that these stocks change value as quickly as they have been!!!!
808 2018-10-18 17:35:50 Super Stocks?
809 2018-10-18 17:35:19 I never had to courage to short. Picked a lot of great performing stocks over the years. Missed out though because I liquidated to buy more MNKD. LOL. I will make it all back and then some though holding. #IFeelIt
810 2018-10-18 17:35:15 Except my MJ stocks holding up in this mkt slide. 
811 2018-10-18 17:34:57 I think you have to have plans for both scenarios in place.  - this could be a bear trap. Many stocks look like $MSFT you have that bear flag that arguably is triggered but == no volume.  -- that's what to watch -- does volume pickup and selling hits or does vol. stay light
812 2018-10-18 17:34:54 Mortgage rates edge lower this week. Economic growth to ease in 2019. U.S. Stocks see an uptick in volatility this week.
813 2018-10-18 17:34:34 I mostly suffer from forecasting errors and overconfidence. I was overconfident on $CRM and $AMZN, and I believed that these stocks can be relatively robust and recover from the volatility soon, but it turns out that I am wrong, they are weak and price plummets. #rpiFTI
814 2018-10-18 17:34:22 I told ya'll I quit my job basically at ATH of markets. There's no reason for stocks to go higher until I am full time employed somewhere or start a company.

819 2018-10-18 17:32:23 The thing that effected my investing most is overconfidence. There has been serval times that I overestimated the time that the upwarding or downing would last, and therefore I miss the perfect time to sell out the stocks. #rpiFTI

826 2018-10-18 17:30:54 It isn’t entirely blind (although I admit, it’s dicey). Co has reported stuff to the exchanges. Yeah, there is always a chance one is taking with stocks that have such a bad past. To me, they sound like they are trying to repair stuff. Let’s wait and watch.
827 2018-10-18 17:30:44 The low growth stocks (value) got mullered a few weeks ago - a week ago the “high” growth stocks (momo) got mullered - maybe that means something -maybe it doesnt - but at this stage im inclined to believe it means something
828 2018-10-18 17:30:17 Uncle ....you trade a lot

Just buy good stuff & keep it...GAW beat forecasts & you sold it...I’m struggling to understand your strategy...you appear to be picking great stocks but shuffling them on price action alone

Forecasting Error has most effected my investing. Based on the past performance of tech company, I forecasts their stocks should continue to increase with little fluctuation. However, they drop significantly recently.

834 2018-10-18 17:26:46 This is the best time to invest. The market is currently down. This means that the prices of stocks are currently down. You want to buy these stocks now because the costs won’t stay low forever. #DreamBigInvestNow #stocks

852 2018-10-18 17:18:17 Trump has taken credit for the stocks being up over the last couple years. But, its slowing. So, in the coming days, he'll ramp up his criticism of the Fed. See, it's never his fault if things go bad, but he's always the reason things are good.

886 2018-10-18 17:09:22 I dunno about log scales, but this does prove the point:  CAGR of a dollar invested before the crash in '87, about 11.5%.  CAGR invested after the crash, about 9.6%.  Both are better returns than you will see anywhere else.  Stocks -- and long time horizons -- rule.

905 2018-10-18 17:04:08 3 of 3 : Is it time for some defensive stocks (non-cyclical stocks)?

Examples of Defensive Stocks:

Consumer Staples, 
Health Care, 
Utilities,

Moreover, the following sectors might do well during late expansion/early contraction phase:
Financials,
Materials, 
Energy
906 2018-10-18 17:03:47 I do not buy until an overall market direction is confirmed. However it's a cyclical bull right now, so you just hang in and hope it doesn't hit your stop-loss.That wasn't an optimal place to buy, so fingers crossed! @ComicStevieMack #stocks #investing #StockMarketNews

909 2018-10-18 17:03:14 2 of 3 : Is it time for some defensive stocks (non-cyclical stocks).

We know that defensive stocks tends to perform better than the broader market during slow down / recessions, and during expansion they perform below the market.
910 2018-10-18 17:02:56 I would modify the flag, same design, but one one of the wheat stocks on one side replaced with a cog to make it more socialist.
911 2018-10-18 17:01:53 1 of 3 : Is it time for some defensive stocks (non-cyclical stocks)?

The recent market volatility may suggest that it is about time to consider defensive sectors (constant dividends & stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall stock market).

928 2018-10-18 16:57:46 True, Bitcoin in a trade, you rent bitcoin for the period of time you own it.  A lot of stocks are the same way.  Not something you put a big portion of your portfolio into and forget about it like you are storing actual value

3) Then hedge out of the individual names with offset orders. And slowly get out of the index?

1001 2018-10-18 16:28:25 In my understanding, the two "opposite" effects has nothing to do with the minor difference between the two programs (just a higher base wage), but because it's a buffer stock policy. Buffer stocks stabilize by raising the wage on one side and suppressing it on the other.
1002 2018-10-18 16:28:14 scott, do you think having delayed data is a problem when trading stocks?do you find it challenging when you place the orders?
1003 2018-10-18 16:27:20 Uptick rule just caused market inefficiencies.  And the alternative uptick rule (when stocks fall 10%), should be removed.  It slows down price discovery process, which can lead to investors buying stocks at too high of a price.

1005 2018-10-18 16:27:01 No they did not because seniors w/social security as their main income do not pay federal income taxes. The cuts they get are to their benefits that they paid for.

1006 2018-10-18 16:26:44 For stocks to fall after the Treasury Sec. Mnuchin announcement that he won't attend the Saudi conference feels like a weak excuse to sell. For the sake of democratic ideals, including press freedom, it is the right decision.
1007 2018-10-18 16:26:42 Out of curiosity, do you think stocks are in a bubble right now and move it to safer low-yield bonds?  With our current regime I’m not sure what’s safer the government back bond mkt or stocks w violitility. Thoughts?

1020 2018-10-18 16:23:25 I don't disagree but if they where allowed to catch and sell, we as the consumer would have more variety and then stocks would recover
1021 2018-10-18 16:23:20 LOL, someone needs to educate himself, anyone can short stocks globally. Its not an american thing.
1022 2018-10-18 16:22:58 They get new talent to bury them, no one is over. 2,3,4 are things they have been doing for years which is charity work. Stocks are good to getting deals like Saudi Arabia deal, nothing to do with product
1023 2018-10-18 16:22:30 Some stocks reversing off lows like now. Tsla baba aapl let’s see

 bullish on pot stocks anymore,  nice gains in VXX + UVXY today....
1027 2018-10-18 16:21:45 Bruh, I wish I learned about Stocks way earlier in my life. Being a huge sports fan and loving stats has definitely help translate the numbers all over Bloomberg.
1028 2018-10-18 16:21:23 I just looked at my portfolio...I bought it at 7c a few months back. Treading water right now but if you can pick it up for 6.5c that's even better. Undervalued and underappreciated...the stocks I love.
1029 2018-10-18 16:20:47 Mortgage rates edge lower this week. Economic growth to ease in 2019. U.S. Stocks see an uptick in volatility this week.
1030 2018-10-18 16:20:45 Feel free to share, Like i say i don't own any bitcoin, but again thats just me i know many traders that do and thats not saying it cant go higher but to me its the ROI i try to seek its why i target all-time low stocks and 52 week low stocks and low floaters and others i see.

1034 2018-10-18 16:19:24 Today is what risk-off looks like. Despite hawkish Fed minutes that initially battered Treasury Bonds late yesterday, we are seeing Treasuries, Gold AND the USD rally at the expense of stocks - particularly high Beta Nasdaq. $SPY $TNX, $GLD
1035 2018-10-18 16:19:10 One sided in terms of real income growth directly related to the cuts. Not literally one sided, perhaps skewed to one side would have been a better way to put it, but I ran out of characters. Tax cuts leading to stock buybacks only helps the small % who actually own stocks.
1036 2018-10-18 16:19:10 Man I’m tired of my stocks falling every damn day.
1037 2018-10-18 16:19:02 but all 3 stocks were in green on Wednesday !! not worried about them.

1042 2018-10-18 16:18:01 SCARY STOCKS:  Scares me popular FANG stocks (Facebbok, Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflicks) have been falling.  And about 40% of S&P stocks are down over 20%. China's down 20%.  You can move your 401K and IRA money to money market from stocks without penalty to avoid stock risk.

1044 2018-10-18 16:17:06 I'm not saying there isnt money to be made trading higher priced stocks I will take whatever gains I have to money is money, I just sometimes try to find plays that maybe could give more at least that's the goal, Amazon could run higher who knows but for me personally its the ROI

1046 2018-10-18 16:16:39 Is there a site like coinmarketcap that shows you a beta indicator? That would be interesting to see. However that diversification stuff is good for stocks but not for crypto. In crypto you higher your risk of scams, hacks, etc. at a certain point.

1074 2018-10-18 16:07:08 Some companies are accepting crypto for payment, other coins would be of interest to me because of their price and possible ROI just like certain stocks to me that's like buying Amazon at $2,000 if it 10 bagged it would need to hit $22,000, i can make those gains faster elsewhere
1075 2018-10-18 16:06:57 I feel like the stocks just follow your charts lol regardless of market conditions!lmao
1076 2018-10-18 16:06:19 agreed. On Tuesday CNBC spots all day long (including Bloomberg) was stocks soar on strong earnings and booming economy. Neither are true but that was the mantra. When stocks sell of they do not mention anything about booming growth and earnings. Mindless banter.
1077 2018-10-18 16:05:55 @CNBCFastMoney Isn’t it normal in October for stocks to sell off into positive earnings expectations as opposed to big selling because of uncertainty exaggerated by broadcast media?

1150 2018-10-18 15:49:37 I’ve been on for 3 years and F index appealed to me because it’s like stocks and shares. But in stocks and shares you don’t have someone moving the goalposts all the time. Need to have consistent rules. The platform does not need to be improved, it’s great. If ain’t broke....
1151 2018-10-18 15:48:54 All this fucking hype over Canada legalizing marijuana and the pressure to get in on the action only for the stocks to plummet. Thanks Market Makers...you suck!
1152 2018-10-18 15:48:50 why the rush out when it was fucking obvious that rates were going up, as stated by the fed, during the course of this year & 2019. any comment by potus or sectrez is scandal & should be confronted as such. potus has been using his bully pulpit to manipulate stocks since day 1.
1153 2018-10-18 15:48:49 they are raising interests rates  and in the last two days  crude out crashed. Oil producers stocks are near the lowest since two years. SO GAZ AT THE PUMP SHOULD BE MUCH LOWER

1156 2018-10-18 15:48:27 there is nothing unamerican about shorting stocks. What's unamerican is stubbornly holding your stocks and watching the value of your portfolio evaporate. One thing that makes America great is our ability to short stocks. Don't get it twisted

1159 2018-10-18 15:48:13 It's always playing with fire. However, I short certain stocks when I believe they are gonna drop and make money when they lose money. Then, reinvest this to grow and not only do I make money, but I also put some of it into XRP. That is one thing I will never short.

1163 2018-10-18 15:46:17 Bonds up? You mean yields up and that is putting some pressure on stocks. I do not think you are understanding the inverse relationship that exists in bonds. -If bonds sell off, yields go higher...
1164 2018-10-18 15:45:59 “The trick in investing it just to sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot. And if people are yelling 'swing you bum', ignore them. There is a temptation for people to act far too frequently in stocks just because they are liquid”
1165 2018-10-18 15:45:16 No reason to be a hero in this market. Just look at sectors green, look for stocks in these sectors that are green and not selling off. That is your pocket of strength.

1227 2018-10-18 15:21:44 Interest rates are rising. That is bad for stocks. 

But rates are rising because the economy is growing, which is good for stocks.  

High growth could cause inflation, which is bad for stocks.

But inflation could boost earnings. That  is good for stocks.

1267 2018-10-18 15:10:58 and i dont think PBOC and Fed will let that happen. $USDCNY above 7.00 means US stocks roll over. Simple. As I said earlier. I think FED minutes were peak hawkishness, only because they had to call Trump's bluff on being called out.

1269 2018-10-18 15:10:15 Got in just below $80 a few months back myself. Value stocks like $PM and their strong dividend are going to perform well should growth stocks continue to pull back. Time will tell; however, as you said I would not be quick to trim #2cents

1271 2018-10-18 15:10:02 Seems like the horse may have left the barn on this one; a lot of these stocks have seen huge runups already, and now it is awaiting game to see if the revenue and profit can meet the high expectations. Still some money to be made with careful choices, though.

1390 2018-10-18 14:27:07 U.S. stocks fell while Treasuries returned to near 7-year highs. The S&P 500 dropped for a second day and continued to hover near the 2,800 level after Tuesday’s rally. Earnings drove the biggest moves, with aerospace company Textron tumbling on disappointing results on shares.
1391 2018-10-18 14:27:04 Being new to trading I have never tried shorting the market. If I flip your method upside down to look for stocks poised to go lower would that work?

1397 2018-10-18 14:24:01 The big question is, are there still naive buyers out there who will purchase stocks at even higher prices than now and not realize the hype? Lot of $ still out there IMO, such retail buyers of course don't move markets up, but big boys will move it up in order to sell to them.

1435 2018-10-18 14:11:13 Agree shorting specific stocks long term for starters is risky. Retirement account is all cash now, will loading them with inverse index ETFs work?
1436 2018-10-18 14:10:37 It’s bad for bonds end of. Stocks are more complex in terms of inputs but a strong economy, rising earnings & dividends and supply/demand (liquidity/buy backs etc ) will determine the correct path for stocks. imho they are no longer cheap but a better choice than bonds
1437 2018-10-18 14:10:29 I read a comment recently that "no one ever became a millionaire by saving". Income creates wealth, saving make Bankers (owners of banks) wealthy. I'm defining saving as putting cash in a bank, I don't consider Tbills, stocks & such as savings. Invest, don't save is the mantra.

1439 2018-10-18 14:10:16 @carlquintanilla brilliant point
Stock buy backs will not be funded by debt if rates rise too much.

● Will this lead to less stock based compensation? 

● Will stock based compensation begin to dilute earnings, because they stopped buying back stocks?

DFA Japan Small Cap Index = +2.8%

1571 2018-10-18 13:29:59 The valuation of stocks needs to correct. Every Americans has to be better educated about that. The Dow Jones should be closer to 18 or 19k, so hopefully it will slowly ease that way without a major panic. And saying “enjoy it...” is dangerous language.

1574 2018-10-18 13:29:14 Stocks may behave differently. Some stocks might start up move before Index bottom. 
Many stocks will start up move when index register best monthly weekly close.
1575 2018-10-18 13:29:09 An interesting observation Matthew. You are right a lot of money was made on stocks that did not even get to mine production which somewhat supports the "greater fool" theory. I suppose in some ways that makes us all greater fools doesn't it?
1576 2018-10-18 13:28:44 so is it better to short individual stocks with broken charts now rather than playing the bounce ? because when RUT underperform, odds of finding a stock in a downtrend is higher than finding one in an uptrend. i maybe wrong. :)

1580 2018-10-18 13:26:48 Is the common man buying stock? Are stocks a better investment? (Aren't they more risky and less useful than a home?) Do people cash out other investments a lot? Aren't there several ways to get cash out of a home? Over 6 million homes are sold each year in the US.

1603 2018-10-18 13:14:23 Distant SL is a kind of Risk Management, where volumes decrease. The Loss though always remain the margin paid.

1639 2018-10-18 12:58:36 I had this crazy dream last night. Canada legalized marijuana. People lined up for hours to buy The Man’s weed. Stocks soared and crashed. Fortunes were made and lost. Media covered it like white on rice. So weird.
1640 2018-10-18 12:58:19 At this stage of the cycle, dear sir, it is not all about stocks up. Rising rates and peak growth rates will peak the market. You should be proud of all you are achieving. Equities cannot go straight up forever.
1641 2018-10-18 12:58:18 For those of us that are builders, geometry is necessary. Not all of us need to learn how to trade stocks and bonds, a.k.a. how to participate in a fake economic system based in a fraudulent fractional reserve banking system. Sorry Noah, I have to disagree with you on this one

1654 2018-10-18 12:49:54 A friend from high school and I have been sending letters to each other ever since we went off to different colleges. Add a deployed bf this year and my card stocks are so low now!
1655 2018-10-18 12:49:31 Crazy to think crypto has made so many people rich and that’s the perception. I have lost so much money in this space. Making a little investment back in June ‘17. Then slowly putting more and more in since then, losing so much MONEY! If I stuck with stocks I’d be SET! 
1656 2018-10-18 12:48:52 La principal vía de ahorro aquí son los ladrillos, los activos financieros son desproporcionadamente exiguos frente a otro países y eso es subóptimo para el desarrollo. No hay penalidad al ladrillo, hay estímulo a favor de los raquíticos stocks financieros.
1657 2018-10-18 12:48:26 I owned GM stock for a few years based on that theory, but the valuation never caught up as people are more interested in high-risk/high-reward plays now then stable dividend stocks with steady growth. Ie. look at Tesla's stock vs. their earnings.
1658 2018-10-18 12:48:10 Very dry. And when I looked at blue dream by Aurora under a microscope you could see the majority of the trichome heads were missing and their stocks were shriveled. This is caused by irradiation.   #freetheweed  I'll stick with BM.

1665 2018-10-18 12:45:03 Initial Claims hint at a moderation in growth.  While they dipped, they remain above the Sep avg.  Continuing Claims, though, do not confirm a moderation, as they fell to a new low.  Dip in Phil Fed Mfg Index to 22.2 keeps it above Q318 avg (20.2). Neutral for stocks and Tsys.

All you did was add $400,000,000 into the farmers pockets which didn’t make up the 6 billion that tax payers have to pay up for you giving them to bail them out.
1761 2018-10-18 11:50:31 Relaxed doesn't make a good headline. I was hoping for the 'stocks are suddenly very low in the snack aisle' angle.
1762 2018-10-18 11:50:24 Sir I have seen your videos inspiring by that I also traded bank NIFTY expiry I have collatral of stocks by using that I have traded.from last two months I have made 40000.Sir you are  really inspiring motivated and good hearted person.

1764 2018-10-18 11:50:17 I like trading NFLX, one of my fav. stocks. BUT, the valuation is a joke. And the Q4 forecast a disaster. It should  be downgraded. But analysts uped the stock so much, they can't make a fool of themselves now....

1771 2018-10-18 11:44:03 The reason most blacks are poor is because we fail to invest into business and stocks. We make two major mistakes as blacks.

1. We fail to invest for our children because our parents didn't for us.
2. We buy & invest in what we don't really need. Who are you trying to impress?

1793 2018-10-18 11:28:57 Wrong person to address. This is more a question for the @SEC_News as this is a publicly traded stock. CEOs do not have the right to prevent trades on the public market, which would be considered manipulation. If you wanna prevent foreigners to buy stocks, it needs legislature.

**CHINA stocks plunge amid heavy selling in the energy sector and growing worries about their economy
1797 2018-10-18 11:23:14 Interest rates are rising, which is bad for stocks. 
But rates are rising because the economy is growing, which is good for stocks. 
High growth could cause inflation, which is bad for stocks. 
But inflation could boost earnings, which is good for stocks. 
Repeat until crazy.

1807 2018-10-18 11:18:02 Just a guess, but I wonder how many people held tobacco stocks in pensions, divested them all and are now seeing them skyroclet?

1811 2018-10-18 11:13:59 You can drive yourself crazy watching stocks you hate outperform your portfolio. Take them off your screen. It's destructive.

1881 2018-10-18 10:25:55 The percentage of US stocks in oversold territory is at a multi-year high and, together with a jump in the VIX, can be viewed as a bullish signal. The percentage of Russell 3000 stocks below 30 on the 14-day RSI has surged to a multi-year high (38%).This unwarranted fear, IMHO...
1882 2018-10-18 10:23:46 I have a ton of friends that have made boatloads already but I wonder if the stocks have peaked they have been going up and up and up. Eventually they have to level out and then drop

1947 2018-10-18 09:35:43 A very crude method for me is to do a simple visual check of the length of candles.

One can do a difference of the daily or weekly high-lows and take it as a % of the absolute price.

Note - I trade only a 1-2 stocks a month so easy to exclude "choppy" stocks

1972 2018-10-18 09:23:35 Not sure about this one. Nobody knows what will happen once stocks start to fall. We did not yet experienced such a market...so it is a wild guess to claim something like this. And don't count out other options as bonds, precious metals etc.

2015 2018-10-18 08:49:23 Sir since last 2 months-I'm looking for all stocks (in F&O) below 200 EMA which are recovering and once showing resistance from below, just shorting the column reversal on P&F (0.25% * 3 - Daily close). Yesterday's example NF & BNF - shorted the moment price went below day open.

2018 2018-10-18 08:47:11 I'm not sure all customers are gamblers which makes the platform different. For instance I found FI after I wanted to invest in stocks but wanted to do it in something I knew about. My view hasn't altered, it's value to me is its an investment platform.

2026 2018-10-18 08:41:41 Good reason to buy a skunkbag..I think the price is less then $175...don't do anything to give the police something to do or ticket on...read the provincial laws and adapt personal circumstances..use the loopholes with creativity...and buy stocks in the makers of Visine.

Its all psychology. i wont back down on this one
2034 2018-10-18 08:34:52 comparing stock to crypto is not legitimate being that boards control stock companies, that doesnt happen in crypto being tied to BTC its pure ownership of coin and volume. Stocks move slow, crypto moves at a fast rate compared

Surely doesn't want to risk serious injury in 2019 playing for a club he knows he won't be at in 2020? Stocks can't get any higher and won't go down if sits out.  The drama would be gold.

2113 2018-10-18 07:29:42 Obviously therefore 'things' would be, at the most basic, food, drink and clothes; at a secondary level, shelter (which is not even mentioned); and at a tertiary level who knows? Everything else. Maybe stocks or books.
2114 2018-10-18 07:29:13 Thread for some interesting analysis and possible insights. A very wise friend sent me an email today titled '3x in 5 years'. This was basically a compilation of stocks by various folks from a (very good) Whatsapp group 3 years ago. 14-Oct-2015 to be exact. And he said, derive.
2115 2018-10-18 07:25:32 Yup. Agreed. Just find post Fed Minutes price action interesting, especially with stocks off a bit and the Euro and Pound pulling back. And Aussie employment wasn’t all that encouraging so hard for that to be used to reconcile Aussie support. Anyway, just a little observation.
2116 2018-10-18 07:25:13 Key qustion in any validation:

How much good and bad news is priced in?

For many tech stocks virtually all good news are priced in and no bad news are considered
2117 2018-10-18 07:25:09 But I'm still trying to convince myself that SM won't exclude those two in the China team cause they know it's gonna be bad for their sales and stocks
2118 2018-10-18 07:24:43 There are different teams, agreed. But then, they should talk in morning meetings on common stocks. That's what we used to do while working at Nomura.

2131 2018-10-18 07:11:18 Stay short stocks. Most global stock indices are back to their lows. While there has been a bounce back after the recent sell-off, the loose monetary policy era is coming to an end. Liquidity will tighten, rates will rise and highly inflated assets will be tougher to off-load.

2135 2018-10-18 07:08:22 I do not know....Generally equities go up in the last two weeks of Dec. but now the question is at what level we will be in mid-Dec. I have no idea. In theory with the FED doing QT there should be no upside to stocks.
2136 2018-10-18 07:08:16 @1stPennyStocks $LEAS is the big stocks to own
2137 2018-10-18 07:06:50 Thanks for that and it's a fair point. My view of risk sentiment isn't restricted to stocks, but also to other assets like FX, where currencies are generally moving in tandem, from the theoretically overvalued to undervalued, from DM to EM. There's a point there...

2142 2018-10-18 07:03:47 All that ofcourse I know. I am talking about current markets where selling is absolutely risky. And buying gives you big money at low risk. Ofcourse one has to watch and do directional like stocks

2144 2018-10-18 07:02:01 Nifty 5 took Nifty 50 to 11700. Midcap and small caps and other 45 (46) stocks anyway were in bad shape.
2145 2018-10-18 07:01:54 Yeah it’s legal, but still a sketchy market. Kinda like penny stocks. My understanding is it’s basically a gamble, versus say an educated guess when investing in DOW/SP500 or whatever.

Wise up.

2462 2018-10-18 03:03:09 Just because a couple of stocks are running while many are not is no reason to jump in without adequate due diligence. If you take a punt with volume on a stock you know nothing about, expect to be smashed.
A heap of the bios are being played and moved on associative pumps.

2473 2018-10-18 02:58:41 I know. I am a very careful gun owner (really the men in my house, I do not touch them).  But, I  think some people should not have access to guns and, like I said, glad bump stocks are going away.
2474 2018-10-18 02:58:29 Lefty investors should carry Pres. Trump on their shoulders! Trump ran on a campaign of bolstering US MINING, INFRASTRUCTURE & OIL/GAS Dominance!

2479 2018-10-18 02:56:46 Because looking at the sector as a whole they're worth way more than what the projected market will sustain. The stocks at this point are all hype, like the dot com bubble, so it's best to get out before reality sets in which should be some time in the near future imho.

2507 2018-10-18 02:32:53 Yes if it means no more killing children by guns yeah. But we know that's unrealistic. Gun reform will suffice, and a ban on certain guns, bump stocks and raising the age to 21, might do some good.

2530 2018-10-18 02:20:27 Dollars are not a scam because they are not meant to be an investment and are not presented as such (except by FOREX scammers).  

Bitcoin is a scam to the extent that it is presented as an investment "just like stocks" (or "better than stocks").  Or even as a "store of value".
2531 2018-10-18 02:19:23 No actually, it doesn’t. What we had under BO was stagnation, with the fed artificially keeping rates so low the only choice was stocks, for some yield. Note with anticipated growth from Trump w tax rates. regulation overhaul, overseas profits returning, US markets run finally.

2534 2018-10-18 02:18:41 October 17 was amazing, at 12:15am I placed my first OCS order, then bought a few stocks in the morning that had a sell off. 
Was a very predictable drop, given all the people posting about “selling the news”. Even better was the recovery that I didn’t expect so fast. 
2535 2018-10-18 02:18:07 Meaning a dropping usd/cnh is negative for stocks?  I thought the fear of it braking over 7.00 was the fear of causing a sell off.
2536 2018-10-18 02:16:18 Stocks? I'm seeing a lot of names which make money actually( not just sell more or increase users) at 5-20 year lows. Good luck with you right thesis, but you are wrong
2537 2018-10-18 02:16:06 Very much worried when stocks comes down. Why?
2538 2018-10-18 02:14:49 Kinda more worried about a mans torture and death and your complete lack of action. More concerned our president was involved in such atrocity and what that means for our future. Stocks feeding the wealthy wont matter if we can be tortured and killed without a presidential blink.
2539 2018-10-18 02:14:47 When a breakouts/stocks in general are dependent on the overall stock market going up or down for the day, I'm no longer playing the breakout. I'm playing the overall market. And I suck at playing the overall market.

2561 2018-10-18 01:55:20 The bottom line is that risk of fluctuation always is present. Thus stocks are risky unless your time frame truly allows you to live through the downs while awaiting the ups. - Howard Marks
2562 2018-10-18 01:54:27 More like gaming the public relations bump. It actually saved them money by raising the wages. Now employees no longer automatically get free stocks (worth more than the annual increase in pay) and they lost a handful of other perks.

2582 2018-10-18 01:46:32 My main issue is that I don't have any verifiable edge or advantage in identifying the best projects that are undervalued. Like trying to pick stocks. Seems like a hard game.

2588 2018-10-18 01:42:00 Those types of training materials are not a very uncommon practice.  My last employer (who is not nearly as successful as Amazon) used training videos like these, to "educate" the leadership teams in their stores, every year.

2591 2018-10-18 01:40:38 Looking through the charts tonight, there are lots of bear flags developing on this pullback in individual names. Something to keep an eye on for tomorrow for puts if we begin to breakdown. #Stocks #Options #Stocktrading #Optionstrading
2592 2018-10-18 01:38:22 Last  week stocks were hammered, and gold acted as a key  flight-to-safety  asset in the market. Initially, as the U.S market  retreated, gold held  steady. But as the sell-off became more systemic  globally, gold began to  rally meaningfully!
2593 2018-10-18 01:38:10 whether the news is true or not, it won’t change the fact that yg is the WORST at managing his girl groups and that’s why his stocks aren’t growing bc ppl know he stupid
2594 2018-10-18 01:36:57 There is no fight club.  I need to get in chat more often and was in most of today..  I just don't like my employees to see I'm trading stocks.. or they start thinking they can go on facebook on my dime. lol
2595 2018-10-18 01:36:56 Since Obama took credit for the booming stocks, does that mean this is because of him too??
2596 2018-10-18 01:36:38 We could easily have a 20% correction in stocks and continue the bull.  It think this is what most people expect.  Not a crash anytime in the near future.  In fact, most people expect it to be in a couple of years which makes me think the bull continues longer than that.
2597 2018-10-18 01:36:30 Holy miss. How do you find huge run up stocks like these besides a limited stock screener?

In any event Dear Jamie ( @jfc_3_  )

You didnt answer the key component question.

(Can You tell us in advance what stocks will be "temporary" in their decline?)

Is it a case of "Stick to the Clap-Trap" until You can?

2640 2018-10-18 01:09:37 Everyone have their own choices of businesses so no comments on your choice of stocks.

First it's great you maintain a list 

Only one thing to ask : do you maintain a valuation / purchase price (whenever it would come) as well which one intentionally removed?
2641 2018-10-18 01:09:10 Mom texted to discuss dispensary rates/regretting not buying stocks in the weed industry. Thinks my brother did. Dad is considering 'trying cannabis' for his back (keeps talking about brownies).

2648 2018-10-18 01:02:53 I’m buying stocks tomorrow.
2649 2018-10-18 01:02:50 So you get a hard on for bump stocks & weed. Good to know. .oO(really wish I didn't though) it's your right to have whatever fetishes make you happy.
2650 2018-10-18 01:02:10 I have nothing against shorting groups if that makes them money good luck to them , But newbies learn how to long stocks before you start shorting . I DO NOT SHORT TICKER
2651 2018-10-18 01:00:47 While drying volume is usually a sign of contraction I believe it’s because of low interest due to China tariffs and people have moved on to other hotter stocks. Again this is just my thesis I trade the chart.

2661 2018-10-18 00:51:46 Pretty sure Trump wouldn't have banned bump stocks if it weren't for enormous political pressure from the largest mass shooting ever

2664 2018-10-18 00:51:06 Hell, I'd hire you to invest stocks for me alongside yours lmao
2665 2018-10-18 00:50:52 This was an excellent show. In time stocks will be tokenized on Bitcoin. Excellent observation of attempting to quantify the expense spent developing the ecosystem. Bitcoin is the highest quality, least expensive, most misunderstood asset
2666 2018-10-18 00:50:06 Apparently investing in pot stocks didn't turn out like planned.

Doritos stocks though...

2673 2018-10-18 00:44:21 actually there is plenty.  bump stocks are dumb, waste of money. Id rather save it towards a full auto license.  I am ok with people who will protect our rights and not infringe on them further.  I have had dems tell me they want to take all guns

2684 2018-10-18 00:34:47 What Nan is saying isn't true. Corporate cuts benefit all that are in the stock market. Pension funds, 401k,... 1/2 of Americans own stocks, all will benfit. Dems want ppl to think that just some fat cats will benefit, it gets the envious motivated. Corps are major job providers.
2685 2018-10-18 00:33:26 A lot of brokerages do not even offer OTC cannabis stocks. Others like fidelity for example, there are fees of $50 per trade for some cannabis stocks. That’s gonna scare a lot of retail investors away. No ones gonna pay $50 fee for  smaller size investment
2686 2018-10-18 00:32:28 Yeah you have more flexibility in KPP stocks than the Hawks do, that's for sure. It's a real dearth area for us at the moment. I'm not sold on the Bombers yet, I think they need to prove it first, can see why some are bullish on them. I think Dees have earned it and have May too.
2687 2018-10-18 00:31:11 Tell us how you are thriving? Did you get a raise? A new full time job making lots more? Are your stocks making you a millionaire like trumpie? Explain to us all how much better your lifestyle is now compared to 2 yrs ago.

I put 300m in a CD and other stocks and it doubles in 10 years. 600m.  I’ll be 44. 

Add 200m to my foundation. 
200m to family trust. 
Flip that 200m to another 600m in 15 years. Rinse and repeat. #l
2693 2018-10-18 00:28:57 Came across this in my graduate Molecular & Cell Biology genetics class. By inbreeding Drosophila, Nüsslein-Volhard & Wieschaus 1980 kept "5,800 balanced stocks" alive; "4,500 of the stocks had one or more new lethal mutations"; "2,600" inspected for segmentation abnormalities.
2694 2018-10-18 00:26:35 In their employees. That drives up stocks making the rich even richer. Do not be conned. If America is first, why is his factories still overseas?  They do not care about you. Bottom line. Most don’t honestly but at least some dems are fighting for your “entitlement.”
2695 2018-10-18 00:26:01 Yes, maybe it's a liquidity problem. Personally, I only trade stocks in the sp500 with highest volume and open interest.

For the Excel spreadsheet, I use a simple one I've created a few years ago. I use it to track my two strategies.
2696 2018-10-18 00:25:25 US stocks closed lower despite mostly above-consensus corporate earnings. US Fed meeting minutes show a tightening bias while housing starts (-5.4%) came slower than expected.
