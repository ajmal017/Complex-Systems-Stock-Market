39 2018-04-17 23:57:22 Hi There, if i may, which platform are you using to trade Crypto, i want to get on it
40 2018-04-17 23:57:00 おかえりなさい！
41 2018-04-17 23:56:59 Gives immediate liquidity to investors. Easier to trade and transact real estate assets. All the annoying friction is removed or facilitated by tokenizing an asset.
42 2018-04-17 23:56:56 broo need 50% gains right now!!
43 2018-04-17 23:56:39 So we need Crypto Banks
44 2018-04-17 23:56:29 No- it is not possible to support yourself as a vlogger using crypto in China, no that is not helpful. Trying to help by offering inaccurate, unverified information that leads people to think that I have alternatives I'm deliberately choosing to ignore is not helpful.

46 2018-04-17 23:56:07 Pornhub about to start accepting crypto 
47 2018-04-17 23:56:04 I use SquarMilner and they are familiar with crypto assets. They have an office in SF.
48 2018-04-17 23:56:03 All the ones I know are so rich they are bored all the time. Why not travel the world and go to crypto conferences and get really fucked up lol.
49 2018-04-17 23:56:00 How much have you lost since your initial investment?  I have lost 22% since my original investment.  I didn't invest too much so I didn't really lose that much money.  I dabbled in crypto just for fun but I prefer playing the real stock market, more profitable in the long run.
50 2018-04-17 23:55:50 Already planned this but don’t know if we got time today
51 2018-04-17 23:55:43 Thats the best way of looking at it. I missed on the first wave when btc was just coming up, because i thought its to risky to invest in ( eventually it crashed from almost 20k to where its at now). Its going to be interesting how crypto develops in the upcoming few years
52 2018-04-17 23:55:34 People who would pay won't bother, or can't, because it's such a headache to figure out...
53 2018-04-17 23:55:33 Same. VeChain Thor! $VET
54 2018-04-17 23:55:27 Would also love to see some elaboration. I can see how blockchain tech could vastly improve on the land titles system, but I fail to see how tokenized real estate mean anything. Seems like title would just be tied to a token? All ears though
55 2018-04-17 23:55:22 I believe it is getting better. There were so many “experts” causing damage to crypto in December/January.

63 2018-04-17 23:54:47 Why is it that in the #cryptocurrency world, speculators of one coin always seem to want to say negative things about other crypto-coins? You never see poker pros say bad things about other poker pros, right?
64 2018-04-17 23:54:42 at this moment verge did more for adoption than btc and ltc together - we have to see whats the next big thing will be for crypto. Its a very good start for the whole cryptoworld.

73 2018-04-17 23:53:56 I agree with you there.  I'd just like to see some Equihash projects commit to a fork, like XMR did.  You're right about what you said before too ... Eth goes POS and I'm if right about asic's on equihash ... Lots and lots of hash power out there that has to go somewhere.

121 2018-04-17 23:48:54 I was combating the narrative that BTC is onky for criminals because it's anonymous. It is far from anonymous as you know.
122 2018-04-17 23:48:45 Verge must retain morality and ethics and only in this way is it safe in the long run,if not, crypto will disappear.what should people say the crypto money is sloppy.I invest for my children I need crypto money with morality and ethics.I can not leave my morality at the door.
123 2018-04-17 23:48:44 All done!!! Thanks @vergecurrency!!!
However ignore the idiot scammers below. Shame so many scammers on Twitter it really ruins the crypto space.
124 2018-04-17 23:48:43 I want to give Kudos to @ShiftPayments for their quick response to my issue when I contacted support for help. They responded within minutes with a resolution and all is well. Thank you!
125 2018-04-17 23:48:42 It’s amazing how many short sighted people are in crypto and cannot even grasp 1/5th of what the future can be

154 2018-04-17 23:45:49 If you pretend that free markets and Moore's law don't exist, you'd be completely right. And you are right about usage being low, however I'd argue BCH has a much higher percent of real world use as money as opposed to just inter exchange transactions, which is the bulk of crypto

161 2018-04-17 23:44:59 I’m thinking more on this idea...Swift doesn’t just have competition with Ripple, there is IBM with Stellar, and R3. Swift is getting quartered. Swift can either join one or succumb to them all.

164 2018-04-17 23:44:32 Verge must retain morality and ethics and only in this way is it safe in the long run,if not, crypto will disappear.what should people say the crypto money is sloppy.I invest for my children I need crypto money with morality and ethics.I can not leave my morality at the door.

167 2018-04-17 23:44:24 Indeed you did. I was replying to Crypto Knuckles, should have been more specific in my reply.

170 2018-04-17 23:44:00 Oh so your concerned that this wont bring a positive light to crypto? Most privacy coins, even Bitcoin are used daily on much more "extreme" dark web things, at least porn is actually legal. What is the point of privacy coins in real world every day use if not things like this?

172 2018-04-17 23:43:50 $BTC | Don't see the market dropping below 7.8k, heavy liquidity around 7.8-8k. 

More sideways chop around this region before market can regain the momentum to continue it's move to 9k+
173 2018-04-17 23:43:50 $bnb #binancecoin is an interesting one right now. Broke long-term trendline, broke support and next support down is a fairly big drop. In most cases this would be an obvious bail out but it's also so ridiculously oversold I can't see it not recovering soon.
174 2018-04-17 23:43:25 Yeah they killed cryptonight for a time but they also caused the fork which ended up being a blessing. The fork killed the botnets. It also spurred the creation of the other 3 or 4 CN algo variants which will help preserve the low network hashrates of a few spec mining plays.

196 2018-04-17 23:42:05 Today is the day in crypto where a #cryptocurrency is used for a legit purpose and a clear case scenario for its use in a multi-billion dollar industry.  But, it is not enough! If it was Amazon they would say #whyprivacy, if it was wikileaks they would say no one uses it....

210 2018-04-17 23:41:00 It’s probably a good idea to STOP using any apps that are free and contain advertisements.

Most of the time the app makers don’t know who or what goes through the adds.

eg: crypto mining, malware and lots of them leak personal information, even contacts and photos etc.

213 2018-04-17 23:40:45 Our new hiring matrix:

Rabbit hole depth / 5
Mastery of their craft / 5
Commitment to crypto / 5

We need people who are 5 * 5 * 5 = 125

We cannot pay huge salaries. We really care about protocols. We are obsessed with dapp usability and wallet recoverability. 

Fun times.

226 2018-04-17 23:39:18 Ah yes, I'm sure it is, just a strange coincidence that "spam" stopped the instant all crypto usage went down. Meanwhile I'll be pushing for more people to actually use BCH because that's what it's made for. Not for hodling, not for selling for more dollars when the price goes up
227 2018-04-17 23:39:13 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。

239 2018-04-17 23:37:41 I think XVG has the most devout, potentially insane followers in crypto. Every comment section is overrun with them praising the 'partnership' and mass attacking any comment that has anything even slightly negative to say.

243 2018-04-17 23:37:28 Interesting, for sure. I like that they did a lot of coins. We will have to see. Might be hard to regulate Neo specifically?
244 2018-04-17 23:37:03 I don’t agree that having @officialmcafee on a project increases its appeal, for me having him anywhere near an investment is a non starter, however I think Ivan has a point and provided a better argument in this thread.

246 2018-04-17 23:36:24 "The biggest partnership in crypto history" - @Pornhub .... really? Not the IOTA Bosch partnership? Stellar IBM? Ethereum Alliances partnerships? How about Bitcoin being used at Overstock for the past 3 years? @vergecurrency is a joke I'm afraid.
247 2018-04-17 23:36:15 Mad respect. Other need to realize we are in this together as the #crypto community! This will bring more attention to crypto as real currency and bring many more investors.

Lack of adding new & exciting coins, horrible interface (even the new one), bad customer support and no incentive to use (coins associated to #Binance and others) will eventually kill it.

259 2018-04-17 23:35:02 Maybe, but young markets migrate to quality over time. Be carful, crypto moves fast and the incoming money is getting smarter. Adding a shillman to the team quacks like a duck.

311 2018-04-17 23:29:55 i dont even like partnerships if they produce worthwhile results. it's just centralizing crypto and decentralization is literally - literally - the entire point and the entire advantage of blockchain tech; without it, it's just a slow database basically
312 2018-04-17 23:29:53 No where else could you get away with a dual mirror selfie than crypto. 
313 2018-04-17 23:29:49 I have much to learn. Thanks
314 2018-04-17 23:29:46 That’s an absolute lie.  Health insurers need  to socialize costs among the covered so no one is charged excessively for health treatments they need due to illnesses they did mot cause.  So healthy people (young adults) are helping subsidize costs for old fuys like me.  Thank you
315 2018-04-17 23:29:44 I do not understand why some people feel like they have to put others down to lift themselves up. If XVG succeeds, it will be good for all crypto currencies
316 2018-04-17 23:29:31 やった〜。・゜・(ノД`)・゜・。
317 2018-04-17 23:29:26 WHO'S LAUGHING NOW ABOUT THOSE ALT BUYS FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO HUH
318 2018-04-17 23:29:21 Don’t be such a drama queen, this is just the first step you can’t give the masses everything overnight
319 2018-04-17 23:29:14 Yes, help needed, crypto-rookies abound !
320 2018-04-17 23:29:08 When does the IRS go after crypto folks and force them to sell because of previous gains?
321 2018-04-17 23:29:06 思ってた以上にイケメンたちがイイカンジ…あと戦闘。
322 2018-04-17 23:29:00 You bought in again?

325 2018-04-17 23:28:27 Lol..seriously appreciate your commitment to crypto
326 2018-04-17 23:28:03 Disagree I lost all my coins no response from exchange
327 2018-04-17 23:27:59 Hopefully I win so I can recover all my lost money on $xvg
328 2018-04-17 23:27:54 Only inevitable conclusion 
329 2018-04-17 23:27:32 Yep, I bought right near the top and then it tanked 
330 2018-04-17 23:27:29 Yeah sure, makes money from advertising. Nobody pays for porn SUBSCRIPTIONS which is what this is used for. I dint think advertisers will be clamouring to pay for porn hub ads in XVG 
331 2018-04-17 23:27:27 We should definitely see $btc drop down to $7500 and maybe as low at $7200 in the next day or two #bitcoin #btc #crypto #cryptocurrency
332 2018-04-17 23:27:23 Anyone wanna do some crypto % gain bets?
333 2018-04-17 23:27:14 Note the model designator "pay phone tty". I can just imagine West Berlin '85, and a nervous guy squeezing into a phone booth with this thing and start typing groups of five: X0L1A P4HNB S06LE ZBD59 FYRSD X3OS7 0C4VM  ..
334 2018-04-17 23:27:10 I’ve been there, or maybe I am still there
335 2018-04-17 23:27:02 Why would I concert my dollar to crypto to buy a burger? If crypto is a world away for me? Why would you do that? And why would you convert yr dollar to crypto to buy porn?
336 2018-04-17 23:26:56 Until you lose all your coin I lost mine

344 2018-04-17 23:26:14 Well that's the old crypto problem of soldl vs hodl. Since Mindgeek brings more potential users with it than Amazon and Twitter combined, we will at least witness the most accurate test of circulation economics ever (besides speculation) and thus learn more soon.
345 2018-04-17 23:25:52 I fully expect that eventually the tech will catch up to allow mass adoption. I've got skin in the crypto game like most of us here.  I can't wait to reap the rewards and be a part of it as it grows!  The future looks great to me.
346 2018-04-17 23:25:51 Nice, I enjoyed watching Leo’s son play here at Syracuse. We also have Oshae Brisette who is a fellow Canadian stud. Mash that all together with some crypto and you got yourself a follow.

359 2018-04-17 23:23:34 Pluscoin dipped really low (1 sat). The thing with it is that many people don't understand what it is about. At 1-2 sat though this is severely underpriced especially with them launching stuff in a couple of days. $plc $btc $crypto $strat $banca $ocn $hvn

366 2018-04-17 23:22:23 Yea apparently cause I went to tag him and its no longer there. This is a great thing for crypto. Was it what I thought it would be, no it wasn't, but I'm still hodling and I say give it a week and people will grasp how huge this partnership with mindgeek is

396 2018-04-17 23:19:00 The problem with doing any of it really is going on a journey way too far left, and building a massive path of flags and PAZ. 

I aim to look at the most recent swing only, which is easy with crypto because there’s not much history! FX you have to be careful
397 2018-04-17 23:19:00 But can a business survive doing anything against regulation? It wont happen unless there is a crypto that can work with gov. I have a feeling the gov could just take xvg and not let anyone else use it

403 2018-04-17 23:18:18 Yo bro... McDonalds would be a game changer and makes cryptos more family likely to be used or KFC or Starbucks. That could cause real like snowball effects for adoption. This xxx news stuff isn’t attracting any institutional money. It’s not crypto game changing... how?
404 2018-04-17 23:18:06 YoTravelBook will soon launch its rewards and loyalty program backed by Root Blockchain. Travellers availing of YoTravelBook’s services will be issued reward points in Root Blockchain tokens. Similarly, loyalty schemes will also be issued in the same crypto tokens.

406 2018-04-17 23:17:42 The last time @BKBrianKelly suggested a crypto (XRP) it crashed and almost died. Bitcoin cash is trash anyways.
407 2018-04-17 23:17:33 Really liked this project. Believe it is going to be very sucessful. Lot of people want to be part of the crypto world and make an investment but up to now the process is quite intricate to some. Education is needed.

421 2018-04-17 23:16:30 That will never happen as Verge is a shitcoin. Always has been always will be. "Partnering" with a porn company does nothing to improve its credibility. Amazon and Walmart wouldn't touch it.
422 2018-04-17 23:16:04 Which is why lots of other things need to change in America as well, but unfortunately people like many in this thread are against an improved life.

426 2018-04-17 23:15:56 Certainly seems like crypto (liquidity) and markets following similar path/trajectory for your MTF system?
427 2018-04-17 23:15:56 I agree more mainstream use for crypto is great for crypto. But the crypto landscape will change drastically with more gov regulation. Take for example ham radio try and code you radio frequency to hide your transmission from the gov. Can it be done? Yes do people do it? Yes

459 2018-04-17 23:12:42 You're already sharing the money whether you want to or not. It costs more to deny care than it would to provide it to everyone.
460 2018-04-17 23:12:40 Hmm, I was selling BTC all the way cause there was/is always some bill that I need to pay but also always something left in the bag.
Few btc or alt bags or some new rig or solar panels on the roof,...
Anyway journey can't be passive and is not even close to be over.

This isn’t just for Verge, it’s for crypto as a whole. An odd place to start, yes, but a start to mass adoption none the less.

532 2018-04-17 23:05:04 Marxism is taking over crypto. Interesting. Wonder if the end result will be the same as real life Marxism ... everyone involved will end out poorer. I guess so. To much energy into fighting an ideological micro war instead of winning on a larger scale.

545 2018-04-17 23:03:39 But the cost to the taxpayer is higher already, because the average taxpayer spend is the highest in the world. America spends almost 20% of its GDP on healthcare. That could drop back to comparable countries with a better structured system, which also makes it more accessible.

564 2018-04-17 23:02:19 Verge dev said this would be the biggest partnership in crypto, that news of the partnership would  propel the coin to a top 3 coin. Neither is true. Not an exit scam, just a ‘hype scam’. The news of the partnership has propelled it to... 7 cents. What a joke.

573 2018-04-17 23:01:07 I stopped following a bunch of great people because of the crypto hype they are trying to force on us all. Mono-thematic Twitter was never my kind of Twitter.
574 2018-04-17 23:01:01 Govt system is on a risk of fall. 1st let them save themselves then they can do something about crypto. Verge partnership open the door for many altcoin. It's a good thing for all crypto coin not just verge.
575 2018-04-17 23:00:51 Unless only in crypto for the « money », why not be delighted that a cryptocurrency is being accepted by a major company that existed pre-crypto

577 2018-04-17 23:00:41 You might hate this but I do think that adopting blockchain for taxation could solve transparency, traceability & accountability both at State & Fed level. Taxable income is disbursed in some Fed crypto and ledgers are available to see how the money is used.
578 2018-04-17 23:00:39 !! Feel you there, more than one friend has said their tax accountants have just completely NOPEd out of preparing anything crypto related. I recently read somewhere that @coinbase released a tax calculator but idk anything about how (un)helpful it might be

594 2018-04-17 22:59:49 Hopefully a lot of the miners who thought it was going to be easy street get flushed out soon enough.  Much less worried about small time gpu farms than I am silent asic's driving up difficulty, though.
595 2018-04-17 22:59:45 Where is this chart? Thanks
596 2018-04-17 22:59:39 That explains it.. thanks so much!
597 2018-04-17 22:59:30 I’m also not saying to expect it to hit that, but if you’re not day or swing trading a coin you might as well
598 2018-04-17 22:59:11 Guaranteed that Verge dumped all those donations on their community right at the top.
599 2018-04-17 22:58:56 You are right. I hope it plays out well for crypto in general, however I think xvg just limited their market for acceptance outside of that industry.  It's going to be tough to get McDonald's etc to accept xvg due to its relation to pornography and the taboo that cums with it! 
600 2018-04-17 22:58:53 Say if you want to have a night out with friends you can go to an All you can eat and drink place for $20 for 90minutes. Also thrift stores are abundant so clothing is relatively cheap if you know where to go
601 2018-04-17 22:58:52 Bigger dicks than this chode?
602 2018-04-17 22:58:40 Hate or love #xvg, if you are into crypto because you despise the current monetary system.. be happy that major companies are accepting cryptos, as it is a start to a brighter future
603 2018-04-17 22:58:36 Like your periscopes?
604 2018-04-17 22:58:35 Well I feel cheated. Not only is it not the ‘massive deal that will move all crypto to the next level’ but it’s also not a complete exit scam, so I don’t get that satisfaction of saying ‘I told you so’. Damn weak is what it is.
605 2018-04-17 22:58:26 Your video sucks. I used to have respect for you. You're just one of the problems in crypto now. This is a big achievement for any crypto to obtain. If it was XMR or LUX you'd have a different spin on your lame video...

609 2018-04-17 22:57:50 Probably not, but I’m not saying set a 200% order. But floating a 75-130% or order can end up being a good call
610 2018-04-17 22:57:39 IMO there are solutions for whatever a person prefers.  If they would like a third party such as Coinbase to hold on to their Crypto that's ok. Other ppl have the option to be in complete control.

616 2018-04-17 22:57:08 Crypto up and down like coke prices
617 2018-04-17 22:56:59 This is bullshit. If people are making money the politicians aren’t happy. STOP trying to control our crypto. The  govt. is buying crypto AND using Blockchain tech then taxing it’s citizens for ASSETS they own while making laws so we can’t buy more crypto to better our lives.
618 2018-04-17 22:56:49 Actually that’s a common misconception of Tokyo is one of the expensive cities in the world. San Francisco and Manhattan are more expensive. my rent was about $800 dollars a month for a one bedroom studio and weekly groceries was on average $100/ week.

622 2018-04-17 22:56:31 A crypto trader is telling people to still invest in crypto.

639 2018-04-17 22:54:21 Imho all privacy coins will be highly regulated. If they cant then the services that use them will be regulated to the point that using crypto wont be feasible. Thats how gov works and your kidding yourself if you think otherwise
640 2018-04-17 22:54:21 Unless only in crypto for the « money », why not be delighted that a cryptocurrency is being accepted by a major company that existed pre-crypto
641 2018-04-17 22:53:50 I think coins like XRP or (State santioned coin) will be used for government or bank processing. I Bet if I want to pay my taxes in crypto in the future, ill have to convert my LTC into the FEDcoin and send that in. It would reduce need for government to support all the coins.
642 2018-04-17 22:53:38 be ready to go, 
3 rounds full contact.
643 2018-04-17 22:53:25 You know, when I first went for a deep dive in crypto it was 2012 and I read a reddit post by someone hysterical about something and splitting off from Bitcoin.  /1
644 2018-04-17 22:53:24 But verge dev said this would be the ‘biggest partnership in crypto’ & ‘would make the evening news’ & ‘will propel the coin instantly to a top 3 coin’ and all sorts of other huge claims, this deal is nice, but not even close to what was promised, so must be another partnership.

674 2018-04-17 22:49:27 This is why I advocate for crypto currencies. Current favorite? Litecoin.
675 2018-04-17 22:49:22 These 5 coins are all coins that I will be able to reach their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially!
676 2018-04-17 22:49:22 I hate speculative crap like this. Ripple released their quarterly report on Apr 18, 2017...Speculating on a big news is best for day traders, which I am not. If/When WU announce, that’s good enough for me.
677 2018-04-17 22:49:00 yeah, on cryptobridge, the liquidity there is better; my buy order got filled there in 2 days;
about navigation - I also don't like the interface there, and it's hard to get used to new approach after centralised exchanges...

706 2018-04-17 22:45:52 Sell order price was low enough that it filled  easily

710 2018-04-17 22:44:49 Be wary of over hyped coins. A partnership announcement was made today disappointing everyone that bought the hype. The dev team claimed it would be ‘a partnership that would change crypto forever’ but it turned to be nothing more than an already free to stream porn website

720 2018-04-17 22:43:03 I guess everyone is entitled to there own opinion, so good for you! But every founder has there own way of building there crypto.Some pre mine, some just boost it up through social media and sell with no one knowing.Some ask for money to show partnership. None of these wrong.

722 2018-04-17 22:42:39 Because we all know that if one investment vehicle is getting taxed at 95% people will find a way around it or another vehicle to invest in - maybe that even means sacrificing their US citizenship, as some crypto investors have done, to avoid taxation.

733 2018-04-17 22:41:06 GRS grostlecoin, have implemented grostletip for stream labs. This is a good step to getting a foot in the door for using crypto as a form of donation. @StreamlabsHQ  are solid and will give $GRS a boost definately on my watch list.

750 2018-04-17 22:39:24 I think its overall good for the entire crypto community. Its giving crypto the mainstream adoption kick. There's big money on the sidelines waiting to come into crypto imo. The porn industry is 100+ billion dollar industry and its introducing crypto to those that don't know

763 2018-04-17 22:36:38 A crypto miner is a program that runs on your computer doing equations and by solving them you earn money basically bitcoin
764 2018-04-17 22:36:36 Man I feel for you. Twitter is absolutely swamped with scam attempts like this below almost every tweet by a bigger crypto account. Very sorry this happened to you.
765 2018-04-17 22:36:34  The day I let the IRS determine my taxes, I’ll have been six feet under for quite some time. Agree to disagree on that one.
766 2018-04-17 22:36:28 Twitter crypto: where the second a notable crypto presence utters anything, dozens of lookalike accounts appear with fake giveaway scams. Without a crowdsourced sibyl-proof reputation system, how will this ever be fixed? "Report account" seems too slow.

855 2018-04-17 22:24:56 I see no reason to make a specific charity currency. You can use any of the cloins meant for payments. Bitcoin and Litecoin are good choices. A charity can use a company like @AliantPayment to accept crypto donations. With them you have a choice to convert that directly into cash

857 2018-04-17 22:24:23 That explains why so many of the diagnostics, treatments and medications are many times more expensive in the U.S. than in Germany, and I don't mean for the patients but for the insurance company!

997 2018-04-17 22:04:28 If cryptos take off this year with more adoption as we have seen today I would be thrilled. I don't want the major adoption catalyst being pornhub & verge. Sure it's an important precursor, but the start of crypto in the history books ought not to be the porn industry.

Without centralisation, no mass adoption? So ideologically sound crypto is doomed? What's the crack? #cryptic

1062 2018-04-17 21:57:57 "I think its not okay to promote a known P&D artist to your follower base"
this is all you had to say Ed.
Ivan, if you cant see or understand that, your future in crypto will be more expensive than profitable.
1063 2018-04-17 21:57:55 Took my $grs out at 0.0044ETH ... like, around 200% return.  Might live to regret it, but profit is profit, so for now I'm going drinking.
1064 2018-04-17 21:57:53 i saw that!

1067 2018-04-17 21:57:27 That's a solid list. Still holding any $ZAP? I think $TRAC and $TFD will see some nice moves this year.
1068 2018-04-17 21:57:20 When it comes to crypto, I would much rather trust a talking dog wearing sunglasses than a white dude with short hair in a suit
1069 2018-04-17 21:57:11 Would you ask that same question or be that unimpressed if it were Amazon or Walmart excepting xvg as a payment option?
1070 2018-04-17 21:57:09 The main reason for the $BTC decline today due to the New Your probe into exchanges. It sucks for holders but regulation will ultimately bring a safer environment and more buyers/users. #BTC #Bitcoin #ETH #XRP #Ripple

1102 2018-04-17 21:52:56 Verge is a disgrace. Told us a huge partnership crypto has never seen & it's a link on a porn site. What lies. Will verge ever recover from its biggest lie? No chance! I sold out and will never trust again. Lost thousands of dollars!
1103 2018-04-17 21:52:55 Oh by the way, I'm back home from Florida.
1104 2018-04-17 21:52:54 If I remember well, @CryptoGat and some others influencers called out Ian and John as shillers and P&D. It is surprising that after John became advisor for $lux , you have now a positive opinion about them
1105 2018-04-17 21:52:51 I still don’t get why we'd pay with a crypto. Too volatile. One moment I’ve purchase and paid $5 with $xvg the next day it’s worth $2.50. Until this is gone people ar just not using it.
1106 2018-04-17 21:52:50 And the ad network they run....xvg could very well be on every website out there real soon
1107 2018-04-17 21:52:50 Hilarious! I mean, how many guys and gals are into crypto that are on pornhub? Then, how many of them actually pay for porn videos when almost all of it is free. Seems insignificant for such “big news”

1113 2018-04-17 21:52:28 Dutch aint hypocrist..!!They are known to be straight forward. And it is good to see someone taking a good stanz, most of the influncers on twitter buy a super dud coin..pump it and dump it on there followers with amazing TAs
1114 2018-04-17 21:52:28 No I wouldn't let my kids watch porn. That's just bad parenting.
Verge partnered with mindgeek, a company that contributing the world wide usage of a form of crypto currency. Crypto in the porn relm hasn't been tapped into and verge has in the legal way. No dark web shit.
1115 2018-04-17 21:52:28 This is true not only in crypto-space.
1116 2018-04-17 21:51:58 Your dollar is worth less than you are lmao. NY's stubbornness towards crypto acceptance will only hurt it in the future.
1117 2018-04-17 21:51:51 The crypto-assets that survive could have a significant impact on how we save, invest and pay our bills; that is why policymakers should keep an open mind and work toward ­­an even-handed regulatory framework that minimizes risks while allowing the creative process to bear fruit.
1118 2018-04-17 21:51:50 If it does gain wider acceptance more likely be digital crypto for the kids and gold silver/gold silver backed crypto's for large players/nations.
1119 2018-04-17 21:51:10 But but crypto nick told me to

1126 2018-04-17 21:50:36 $XVG This is HUGE! People don't get it but introducing payments in the porn industry is the fastest way to mass adoption. Security and privacy of a crypto rather than inputing their credit card info? Yes. This will get MILLIONS of people use to crypto as a medium of exchange.

The average crypto investor falls for it and starts getting TOO hyped up, the knowledgeable one stays away because they’re aware these people lead to no good.

1142 2018-04-17 21:48:23 Andy can you explain to your followers your view on #Bitcoin Maximalist. I think it is time to convert some of these new crypto players and traders into Bitcoin Maximalists and HODLers. They need someone to convince them that only Bitcoin matters. Everything else is a test net.

1154 2018-04-17 21:47:19 5/ this isnt about lambo’s and “when moon” bullshit investing. We want it to be mass adopted. If the ceo of a company can see that it is working for mindgeek, it opens up the possibilities for all crypto to benefit not just verge. It’s the start of mass adoption for big business.
1155 2018-04-17 21:47:16 Amazing haha. The Lambo-watch 
1156 2018-04-17 21:46:57 
1157 2018-04-17 21:46:32 You're correct.  I'm not a huge Verge fan (heh), but they should get some credit here.  If they don't fuck this up, they'll put crypto more into the public eye.
1158 2018-04-17 21:46:27 Yes. I am so disappointed, I and everyone has sold all xvg. I will never ever put another cent into this disgusting lying crypto ever again! Hate verge!
1159 2018-04-17 21:46:26 How can you trust the judgement of someone who can't even secure his own crypto?
1160 2018-04-17 21:46:24 I understand your point of view better now. Thanks for clarifying.

1162 2018-04-17 21:46:06 @MattMCd0well thank you for following us, much appreciated 
1163 2018-04-17 21:46:03 Frankly @Crypto_Ed_NL has lost all credibility for me and most people that are sick of emotional, raging pre-pubescent trolls. I don't know how old he is but the maturity level just isn't there - not enough for me to keep following him and polluting my feed. Good luck.
1164 2018-04-17 21:45:58 Lots of ppl are safely securing their crypto assets. I think that the crypto community puts too much emphasis on “ogs” and too many crypto ppl think they’re smart/informed but they click links they shouldn’t, use PCs for crypto, don’t use hardware wallets, and believe TA works.
1165 2018-04-17 21:45:42 Blockchain technology and Social media mixed together to form a solid bod and buikd a better exchange, that's what we can get from Caratz.
@CaratzTeam #CARATZ #TokenSale #ICO #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto #cryptocurrency
1166 2018-04-17 21:45:37 Not really, it depends on the offers on both sides. If a crypto only offers its service and nothing else, is that enough? A partnership always refer to both giving cash? #xvg is the first opening a good channel to mainstream, of course they had to stretch a bit. good luck 
1167 2018-04-17 21:45:35 Interesting article about the benefits of OAX!
1168 2018-04-17 21:45:13 Very positive, but this news is 2 months old. Still interesting and good to know. Nice things about to happen 
1169 2018-04-17 21:45:09 No problem. Keep up the good work!
1170 2018-04-17 21:45:09 I just bought more crypto witb my tax return
1171 2018-04-17 21:45:08 Read 4 crypto articles today. All trash.

Two were out-and-out shills for coins. One was written by someone who knows nothing about #crypto & one was pure speculation & guesswork with no evidence to back it up.

Proper education & journalism in this space is still a major issue.
1172 2018-04-17 21:45:08 I’ve been following both of you for a while and a fan of both. But, I agree with Ed, it seems as if you were against Mcafee for PnDs just a little while back. But now that he’s onboard a coin you heavily invested in, you support the move?
1173 2018-04-17 21:44:57

1175 2018-04-17 21:44:44 It’s a %, not USD value. I have a lot less than people think. My crypto isn’t stored anywhere accessible. Thirdly I plan to pay the tax due on any profits.

1178 2018-04-17 21:44:23 much appreciated my friend!
1179 2018-04-17 21:44:15 Also remember that John McAfee is a giant in the mining business and @LUX_COIN is a PoW coin. How many solid PoW projects do we even get to recognize and appreciate in this endless sea of shitty Ethereum vaporware ICOs nowadays?
1180 2018-04-17 21:44:09 NO WAY LOL..... this is an interesting fact/Idea and a real distant one from crypto (or not), you might be right of course, but you just had to dig too much to come up with this. Good one tho.
1181 2018-04-17 21:43:58 Great project and huge growth potential

1188 2018-04-17 21:43:30 Like a vergeん！！！
1189 2018-04-17 21:43:28 Anything to do with crypto now causes me actual revulsion, whereas it just used to be disdain. Very, very few businesspeople now seem to be tempted to go anywhere near it, leaving plenty of room for the hapless, shysters and the circling sharks.

1196 2018-04-17 21:42:47 Great job!
1197 2018-04-17 21:42:46 Yes, i did over generalize the situation there. But the world we live in, crypto has many promising projects that are being reported by credible 3rd party sources.  I was in WTC in 2017, but saw that they have failed to deliver news from anywhere but their own channels

1240 2018-04-17 21:38:20 Why people prefer to see amazon or ebay, or even adyen partnership? Why you need to pay for something privatly on Amazon? Maybe there are some cases, but I think there are much more cases to pay for services on biggest porn websites in web)) #xvg $xvg #Vergecurrency
1241 2018-04-17 21:38:18 A family having two factor to confirm logins to their bank account is much better than nothing. This is also not the same risk pool as someone with crypto on an offshore exchange or a major web company trying to protect their DNS and web host.

1247 2018-04-17 21:37:46 no, I don't delete any of my tweets.  I don't need to hide my mistakes, or my face behind an anon avatar.
1248 2018-04-17 21:37:21 Haha yeah that’s what I thought you meant. I mean why would pornhub take the risk of accepting a shady cryptocurrency without good reason. A lot of thought has gone into this. They’re a major company. They might sling anal porn but they have a legit turnover.

1253 2018-04-17 21:36:51 The @DiaryofaMadeMan hack highlights that Crypto is far from ready for mass adoption.The average consumer can’t assume responsibility for keys or safety of tokens.We need a service provider layer  incl. “token managers”, insurance companies etc before we talk  about mass adoption
1254 2018-04-17 21:36:51 ah, nornally you delete awkward tweets?
1255 2018-04-17 21:36:36 Yes, because they have support from other influencers like yourself. If you know you have influence, you also know you have a responsibility.

1265 2018-04-17 21:35:06 How do they degrade women? Are you saying women can’t like sex? That is so sexist, it’s 2018, you should be ashamed. #metoo
1266 2018-04-17 21:35:06 Crossover DEMA9 vs EMA9 on H4: #STEEMETH !   #altcoin #ethereum #eth #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #STEEM
1267 2018-04-17 21:35:02 $Ship bro, already up 40% its it's like stupid how low the cap is, and I think it's got a business model that traditional investors can understand and rub their head around. To me it was a no-brainer.
1268 2018-04-17 21:34:58 Also I hate to add this after all that back and forth but Balina being part of an ico *might* not be soooooooo bullish anymore going forward 
1269 2018-04-17 21:34:56 What we experienced today: So basically Verge bought a 'partnership', LUXCoin bought a clown... Sorry, an advisor. And now people tell us that this is supposed to be bullish news? What? Welcome to crypto. What a time to be alive.

$BTC $ETH $LTC $XVG $LUX
1270 2018-04-17 21:34:53 Congrats 
1271 2018-04-17 21:34:53 You are wrong the U.S. insurance prices, health, home, and car are based on the non payments of people who can't afford it we are all paying one way or another.
1272 2018-04-17 21:34:52 I relly dont need you to explain me anything, whats your trading experience apart from your Bitconnect adventures?
1273 2018-04-17 21:34:47 I am from Italy and i don't care about IRS. BUT unfortunately the clock of the world is US clock.
1274 2018-04-17 21:34:46 I didn't notice someone mentioned McAffee should be followed. Just that his name brings attention, which is good promotion. It might be.

Personally I don't like the fact he is with LUX now, but neither do I think he'll ruin the coin. What now, abandon LUX because of that douche?
1275 2018-04-17 21:34:34 Porn sites are accepting crypto currency. Now there won’t be any problems as of why money was spent on porn on a bill.
1276 2018-04-17 21:34:31 Apparently Verge Token paid PornHub $6.5 MILLION to become their crypto currency of choice.

Could be FUD but if it’s true it’s more of an advertisement than a partnership.

1278 2018-04-17 21:34:19 If you're not here just for the money (nothing wrong woth that either)  it is strange that you would promote/support/encourage this sort of thing... 2 characters that embody much of what is negative about crypto. @CryptoGat @BitcoinBravado
1279 2018-04-17 21:34:11 I mean verge paid u mad man
1280 2018-04-17 21:34:10 Tip* - if the coin you believe in gets rekt , buy more  unless it’s a #shitcoin
1281 2018-04-17 21:34:01 I can always tell when you're out hustling because your shitposting goes WAY down.

1283 2018-04-17 21:33:48 Most people in crypto that shit on SJWs are themselves EJWs (economic justice warriors).

Including myself. 
1284 2018-04-17 21:33:17 Interesting.. I don’t see why they would need to. They’re a massive company. Sensible business model. Buy premium filth without your wife seeing the credit card statement. Makes perfect sense.
1285 2018-04-17 21:33:14 Lol .... Seriously what to say except that I think verge is the most rotten crypto in the shitcoin category
1286 2018-04-17 21:33:12 Please add Verge XVG to your Crypto offering. Its not too late. #vergecurrency #XVG @vergecurrency @CoinbaseSupport

1289 2018-04-17 21:32:49 Example of a Partnership: 
2 or more entities going into business together to create something of value for profit

NOT an example of a partnership: 
A website starts using $crypto for payment where the majority of its customers get the product/service for free
1290 2018-04-17 21:32:48 lol you are making no sense.  I did not tell people to follow them.  I clearly stated the fact that as a trader, projects with those names on them increase in value.  If you are too blind to see this then idk what to tell you.
1291 2018-04-17 21:32:47 If there's one thing I can't stand it's logical inconsistency.

It's the male economic justice warriors from the various crypto tribes that are most guilty of using emotional appeals (Vitalik, Ver, etc).

Your tweet was mild in comparison.

1301 2018-04-17 21:31:28 you’re unemployed? go to the doctor you get treated. you’re working a “normal” job go to the doctor you get treated. you’re retired, go to the doctor you get treated. you want to get better treatment than the standard treatment? fine, works as well, you pay extra.
1302 2018-04-17 21:31:22 After a horrible Dec/Jan innitiation into crypto and getting REKT, I feel like learned SO MUCH & I'm finally making decent decisions. #TrialByFire
1303 2018-04-17 21:31:12 I think that's the gamble they are taking: how much advising and connecting can they get out of this? But imo, for a small project sitting in this obscure niche on cryptopia while building something much more magnificent (again imo as an analyst), that gamble might be worth it.
1304 2018-04-17 21:31:03 2/ the point is to create mass awareness and introduce a lot more people to the industry of crypto. Mindgeek also has infrastructure, online advertising service generates targeted and instant traffic to a site by optimizing bidding strategies and provides the ability for market..
1305 2018-04-17 21:30:48 Look at that ugly chart lol. Bitcoin cash?  My god, please.  @BKBrianKelly @CNBCFastMoney a bubble is bursting in crypto
1306 2018-04-17 21:30:44 Correctly stated 
-Satoshi was always pleasant and direct yet listened to everyone. When in disagreement he chose to ignore or become complacent with a soft acknowledgement. This was the temperament of the crypto founder yet the ones fighting for the spotlight fall short.
1307 2018-04-17 21:30:43 You know, when I give job interviews, cryptographers are never the ones who volunteer to roll their own crypto. Correlation or causation?
1308 2018-04-17 21:30:27 Some curious symbolism here...
1309 2018-04-17 21:30:21 明日は晴れて欲しいね
1310 2018-04-17 21:30:18 Very balanced. Can Crypto currencies/DLT also pick up the mantle of positive globalisation where leading trading nations are obstructing and distorting?
1311 2018-04-17 21:30:17 Hmm... that's a bit outdated... How did that go over? Doesn't seem like a multi-billion corporation, unless the deal was with Shopify, but the article doesn't read that way. Anyways, wish you well. Lots of room in this sphere for everyone to do well w/o trying to tear others down
1312 2018-04-17 21:30:01 By my reckoning, he's a crypto fascist that seems to be slipping under the radar for some reason.
1313 2018-04-17 21:30:00 I have no opinion about Lux. I'm fine with him shilling that. But I have problems with influencers advising their large follower base (many inexperienced) to follow a known P&D artist. You simply just don't do that as influencer whom feels responsible for his followers

1315 2018-04-17 21:29:49 my question and this is not fud ! a crypto with a "solid reputation" should not have to pay a fee to offer expansion and growth to a company. especially when the crypto has "techs/devs" to do the architecture connections.
1316 2018-04-17 21:29:44 $REN could be critical in getting institutional money to start tiptoeing into #crypto. Huge fan of the project.  #NotInvestmentAdvice
1317 2018-04-17 21:29:42 What mining company is out there in the United States in bitcoin and crypto currency that you can join for less than $500
LET ME KNOW???
1318 2018-04-17 21:29:41 Agreed. $BEZ $SETH $CL all are down the drains. I guess so will $KNW token follow.
1319 2018-04-17 21:29:34 You could do a crypto calendar with daily inspirational quotes.

1327 2018-04-17 21:28:45 D’où le fait qu’il y a 3-4 mois j’étais très douteux quant à la certitude de Project d’une « EXPLOSION DES CRYPTO » après ces 3-4 mois comme il le criait sur tous les toits, et en effet il avait bien tord

1332 2018-04-17 21:28:04 In crypto, with any governance you can have any feature you want.  I’m not sure what you mean here.
1333 2018-04-17 21:28:04 You are one of ETC's main shills. No need to act oblivious. I haven't seen any reason to believe it will ever be in the spotlight. It has only dropped further and further against ETH and the rest of crypto. There are ERC20 tokens with a higher market cap for crying out loud :).
1334 2018-04-17 21:28:03 “Everyone is still waiting for end-use use cases where crypto-currencies are better than existing currencies. We still haven’t seen a lot of those…but the infrastructure just hasn’t been in place.” Naval

1340 2018-04-17 21:27:38 I’m telling you dump and run before time runs out. BlockChain, it’s ledger system and encrypted mining machines are the innovation. Crypto coins  are BS Monopoly money

1342 2018-04-17 21:27:26 Keep in mind that @RevolutApp stated they are to implement #XRP #ripple on their app-based exchange in April. I was eagerly waiting for that, since im very enthusiast about #XRP and Revolut, the only european neobank already srsly turning into crypto.
1343 2018-04-17 21:27:20 Same boat i should have sold my 20mm html at 38 sats bought it at 1 sat when bitcoin was 2k. Didnt pay much in taxes for crypto though. Haha

1359 2018-04-17 21:25:55 My opinion. McAfee is addicted to money. If you just pay enough, he will shill anything you want. Since he is busy with so many projects, how likely is it that Lux will get the full attention it needs?

1363 2018-04-17 21:25:40 1/If verge can successfully provide mindgeek and it’s customers an easy, secure and fast way to pay for its services and as an alternative to fiat without any problems then it proves to other major businesses as an example for all crypto currencies the use of crypto as a whole...
1364 2018-04-17 21:25:29 Aside from that, do you have any objections to LUX as coin - from FA  perspective?

1373 2018-04-17 21:24:12 What does this mean for Crypto (Bitcoin & Altcoins)? Is it that significant, or not really?
1374 2018-04-17 21:24:07 business works in mysterious ways. 
Both sides of every business deal have an incentive to close the deal or nothing would ever close. 
We are in a developing market. Traditional rules or what you are comfortable with in your capacity, really as a bystander, need not apply.

1376 2018-04-17 21:24:05 I believe this as well. The IMF/FED/ECB will take the best qualities that blockchain has to offer, and create a crypto that's more scalable, trackable and taxable than BTC. It's clear that BTC just won't work as a tx currency. Sovereign gov. will remake own versions which are.

1408 2018-04-17 21:20:01 People don't realize that @LUX_COIN has everything in place, incredibly productive devs, valuable use case design, tech (top notch privacy, smart contract capability on a hybrid PoW/PoS chain, killer algo). They lack exposure & business connections. That's where Mcafee shines.
1409 2018-04-17 21:19:58 I’ve been talking about $LUX since it was 80 cents, this is nothing new.  You don’t follow me, don’t jump in on some bullshit.
1410 2018-04-17 21:19:50 Yea because reaching millions of people and introducing them to crypto on a mass level is so stupid. /s
1411 2018-04-17 21:19:47 j/k I'm a Gator, baby. Bring the hate.
1412 2018-04-17 21:19:43 @crypto_pulse thanks for the follow Cryptopulse looking forward to sharing tweets with you have an awesome Tuesday!

1414 2018-04-17 21:19:24 Plenty to go around 
1415 2018-04-17 21:19:21 Being invested in Lux and suddenly your followers should trade with a known p&d artist? What a professional advise to a large follower base where a lot of them don't have enough experience to trade such plays. Keep shilling kids

1418 2018-04-17 21:19:15 If it's great news, why did the price go down so much?
1419 2018-04-17 21:19:15 Crypto as an asset class is ok. Crypto as global payment system is better. Crypto as a way of managing resources and crowdsourcing government is god-tier.
1420 2018-04-17 21:19:03 Crypto currency would solve this. Buy Litecoin and pay with Litecoin.

1459 2018-04-17 21:14:23 I am very much against Government control. But I think this is necessary to a degree. There definitely needs to be better security and insurance with crypto exchanges. There are far too many hacks and problems currently.

1469 2018-04-17 21:13:19 How does it feel to know that XVG was only accepted because paid a lot of money?
Remember: 
                      "Adoption" is not "pay for".

for me, now, XVG is in the same XRP category: WHERE EVERYTHING HAS PRICE.
1470 2018-04-17 21:13:16 Interesting how I’m primarily a growth investor in stocks but a value investor in crypto. 
1471 2018-04-17 21:13:15 Sorry man but nobody needs crypto to pay for porn. There are cash cards, credits, other crypto, etc. this is a massive joke on $xvg Verge fam
1472 2018-04-17 21:13:14 Lived in Japan for a year. Payed $30.00 a month into the national healthcare. A doctor visit for the common cold, a full physical, and medication cost about $35. So Japan definitely has it right. Also room got a root canal and the copay was $50.

1480 2018-04-17 21:11:39 Diversify, buy gold, silver, Bitcoin and Litecoin. Millenials will be probably going to the cryptoassets and the conservatives to gold and silver (maybe allocating 1-5% of savings on crypto)
1481 2018-04-17 21:11:35 Someday they might be, and other people will be paying into the pot that you'll be drawing from. But never mind. You'll be able to pay for your bill, or maybe you won't and you'll be okay with dying of something simple.
1482 2018-04-17 21:11:35 What the FUCK do you think insurance is? What the FUCK do you think taxes are for? Your education in the USA is garbage it seems.

1488 2018-04-17 21:10:29 Pornhub is about a billion times a better partnership than I was expecting. Are they disappointed??
1489 2018-04-17 21:10:22 As "BIG" as this is, you would think this would be in crypto news SOMEWHERE outside of walton's own medium and reddit postings.  Right?
I mean, do we just leap off of whatever the marketing team says?  You want a 3rd party to substantiate the claims.  Haven't see it

1536 2018-04-17 21:04:33 It's a complete disgrace, but I'm not surprised. Verge and it's sleaze campaign are just further polluting the already morally compromised crypto Twitter space, and now I have even more junk to sift thru to get relevant info. My block list is LONG.
1537 2018-04-17 21:04:27 people no longer believe in Facebook for privacy issues - Facebook was smart would have taken the opportunity to enter the world of Crypto with Verge
1538 2018-04-17 21:04:22 Beware that the original link here is a scam post by a fake account. DO NOT send any money to that link or give your credentials.

1545 2018-04-17 21:03:21 @eeyk1993 Ok Carter, you have a good point. Maybe we can view this $xvg partnership as an early success for crypto in regards to merchant processing and privacy. At the same, given the hype, I believe time hodlers were expecting news of something more substantial & wide-reaching.

1549 2018-04-17 21:02:53 It’s an audience of millions of people a day that aren’t necessarily aware of crypto or invested in one particular coin. There isn’t an outlet for XRP that gets that kind of coverage outside of the XRP fan base. It’s a large amount of awareness.

1592 2018-04-17 20:59:15 If partnerships with bank aren't of interest to the average crypto investor, they shouldn't invest in XRP... But this is just the start, it will be heard of for other reasons and people will be convinced and jump in late.

1604 2018-04-17 20:58:06 A pity I've not known earlier about crypto & therefore to invest in $XRP during 0,05 values or even less.

1611 2018-04-17 20:57:14 I checked out this account because @JonTronShow RTed this. So this is basically just a crypto-fascist page, right? I mean I get that classical architecture is pretty but there's a line between appreciating old shit and desperately clinging to the past and refusing to adapt.
1612 2018-04-17 20:56:55  QUESTION: Why is it good to use #Crypto as a payment method, specially in the porn industry?

 ANSWER: Stop using your creditcard and pay with cryptos, be 100% anonymous with your transaction, safe and clean

1615 2018-04-17 20:56:46 That's the most astonishing part, a foundation asked the community to donate money so a crypto can be accepted as tender on a porn site? Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever! Totally a "mind blowing" experience

1664 2018-04-17 20:52:03 My thoughts on Ian Balina having $2,000,000 worth of crypto stolen:
1665 2018-04-17 20:51:51 no idea what’s going to happen with the current crypto market...patiently waiting. might have to go lower again unless some new pumps happen. problem is, people get scared buying lower.

1669 2018-04-17 20:51:15 So, basically you are saying that your 70k followers and the Bravado members should join a P&D fest or a shilling party??? wow

Or did this genius idea came up after McAffee turned up in 1 of your investments?

1671 2018-04-17 20:51:09 Hey @LandM_Marius you ready to admit you are wrong about the DJI stock market crash yet? Crypto will be fine it doesn't need a crash to succeed.
1672 2018-04-17 20:50:51 It would be nice if Ripple produced news that was interesting to those outside of their HODL community as partnerships with banks don’t interest the average crypto investor. Verge partnered with a media outlet that brings 28.5 billion visitors annually. (2 of 2)

1680 2018-04-17 20:49:51 Ever heard of Vice Token (VIT). When it comes to the porn industry, VIT is the crypto that allows you to be paid to watch porn. Free porn isn't good enough anymore. We want to be paid for watching it too.

1694 2018-04-17 20:47:52 Who pays for porn? = who buys crypto? Same thing. You can watch free porn without the exclusive content. You can mine crypto coins without masive gains. Good job #xvg #vergefam!!! Porn is a big industry.

1703 2018-04-17 20:45:55 As a crypto enthusiast I feel obliged to use some verge on how this partnership works.... you know just to see if its accessible and easy to navigate.... 
1704 2018-04-17 20:45:54 There's a saying, "The game is over, when everyone knows it's being played"  
If patterns have emerged, brilliant minds will recognize these and either exploit, expose or capitalize upon them. 
IMO the market needs to have bad actors. They ultimately lead us to harden the tech.
1705 2018-04-17 20:45:44 It's fresh, it's revolutionary and...it's here.

1706 2018-04-17 20:45:43 if u can't digest and analyze this kind of crypto adaption and god knows what kind of things u try to communicate in ur youtube video. if u disagree, plz educate how crypto will go mainstream and used by all industries.
1707 2018-04-17 20:45:42 Oh yeah - there's definitely a dilution of payments going on when it comes down to the worker level and it's getting worse, similar to the situation w/music industry, reg media industry, etc. Verge partnership really solves nothing other than "muh crypto pump"
1708 2018-04-17 20:45:40 im so confused now
1709 2018-04-17 20:45:28 $WTC is a joke? Ok!
1710 2018-04-17 20:45:18 if it was a publicly traded company, because from their perspective, it was a fucking brilliant move (the attention by crypto twitter testosterone alone- sorry gals ). Verge may dump or pump short term, but the story of pornhub's success will set a nice example - I'm sure of it.

1713 2018-04-17 20:44:50 No, but it sounds like a really bad idea. Crypto-mining is a dead end, rapidly becoming obsolete.
1714 2018-04-17 20:44:46 Is this really news? You can do better guys.
1715 2018-04-17 20:44:40 Left hand turns are the most inefficient and dangerous thing ever invented ever. So we made a sport out of it.

1722 2018-04-17 20:43:54 Do you not realize the amount of people this will reach? This is big for Cryptocurrency as a whole. It’s almost like our own crypto community is trying to stop/hate on mass adoption. makes no sense. No matter what you’re invested in you should be pro adoption for all crypto.

#Bitcoin had a drop that brought it under $8k 
A drop was expected as I wrote earlier, the important thing is to stay above the support around $7500 to avoid going to test the bottom

1800 2018-04-17 20:36:10 $XVG could have announced a partnership with #Amazon and they would of still got bashed today. Amazingly, one way or another these same people are also invested in crypto........why not stand up and applaud Verge’s effort at bringing crypto forward into the mainstream outlets?!
1801 2018-04-17 20:36:04 Hey @vergecurrency , can you explain the @CoinBase logo in the Get Started page? Is there something we don't know?

1803 2018-04-17 20:35:50 Some other guy said for it to be a head and shoulders, the shoulders must not show more volume than the head.  Is there truth to that?
1804 2018-04-17 20:35:43 Please can I ask a favor. I need to get as many people as I can to download the DeVere Crypto app. 

All you have to do is sign up using your email address and use the reference code *23224* (very important to put this code in cos it’s linked to my profile).

1805 2018-04-17 20:35:41 I know it’s a double edge sword. If they launch the inquiry and find out that the exchanges are playing games: short term, price of the crypto will go down , but eventually price will skyrocket. We need some sort of regulation.

1811 2018-04-17 20:35:20 cool
1812 2018-04-17 20:35:16 It's still a way to go for mass adoption, just because it's to easy to use a creditcard. But it's a huge partnership, in so many other ways. Just think how many more that will look into crypto in general and the first altcoin they encounterd... Yes this is HUGE
1813 2018-04-17 20:35:11 Truth, but your looking at the porn industry alone which includes, tv, toys, magizines, etc. I think internet is about 2.9bn. Next, let look at the market. How many of these people know what verge is or even crypto in general?

1825 2018-04-17 20:33:52 There's plenty of success to go around. I'm happy for anyone who makes money in this space, even if they are a dick 
1826 2018-04-17 20:33:46 "You can buy _____ with *insert cryptocurrency* so you endorse _____" is such a poor argument

1840 2018-04-17 20:32:13 you guys shouldnt be in crypto anymore!!
1841 2018-04-17 20:32:10 This is false. Btc saw negative days on 4/16, 4/13, and 4/9. Do you even candlestick?
1842 2018-04-17 20:31:48 Aye for anyone who is into crypto currency buy @xvg just a deal done with @Pornhub... This deal is sure to get XVG up....
1843 2018-04-17 20:31:37 For porn hub to accept verge why did tney need 75 mil verge
1844 2018-04-17 20:31:35 Isn't there a crypto now that promises to pay you for watching?

1848 2018-04-17 20:31:01 Gov. Officials & politicians keep saying they want to protect investors of cryptocurrency from market manipulation but, they ARE manipulating it with their tweets, court filings, etc
1849 2018-04-17 20:31:01 This is called real scam
1850 2018-04-17 20:31:00 The catalyst is that bankers and governments feel threatened by Bitcoin (which they should) so they market sell 1,000 coins whenever they feel like the price is getting too high. They have been doing it for the last 5 months now. They probably are not going to stop anytime soon

1853 2018-04-17 20:30:47 It’s hilarious all these big organizations and players seem pretty pissed they didn’t get in in crypto before the rest of us so now they want a “fair handed approach” after dumping on us for years in the stock markets

1871 2018-04-17 20:29:28 Could this be phrased as "Buy the Announcement of an Announcement, Sell the Announcement"? :-/   While it works in practice in crypto, it's not a guarantee. Imagine if the announcement had been an Apple partnership (yearh right)? It would not have dumped, guaranteed.
1872 2018-04-17 20:29:25 Thanks for the great explanation suppo, btw in holland we can pay already verry easy with crypto. We pay with gulden the nlg coin. they work together with nocks verry trustfull coin for real use.

1883 2018-04-17 20:28:15 What I´m seing and I would be glad with it, is another crypto joining the venture TokenPay + Verge + other. I´m HODLing. The future looks promising.
1884 2018-04-17 20:28:13 So he's a huge name in the crypto space. That's why it went viral. (Not to assume what you did/didn't know) people will follow this guy off a cliff. Real opsec would be for them to not use real numbers and use Google voice or sudo for things like this. Imo
1885 2018-04-17 20:28:10 Lol you just proved that you are a deep shit coin. Wraith protocol isn't working... Took money from people so that Pornhub can start accepting verge, what the fuck! This is what you call partnership... You motherfucker.. I donated 2500 verge and now I feel fucking cheated

1910 2018-04-17 20:24:53 Nope, I’ve received payments from businesses and clients that I would not have otherwise gained if I didn’t offer that option. They would have moved on to someone who does because if they got $LTC at $5, and now it’s $130, then what is the value to them for what they are getting?

1914 2018-04-17 20:24:14 Hi Joseph! We love the @MakerDAO project!  We think if the goal is crypto-crypto lending, then decentralized solutions are best.

But a lot of crypto holders truly *want* a loan in fiat -- that requires centralized lenders such as ourselves.
1915 2018-04-17 20:24:11 He morally doesnt like the way the coin has taken, and was a gentleman about it. That is no reason for you to be childish about it. He will be missed in the #Vergefam.

1922 2018-04-17 20:23:27 色々考えてたんだけど、やはりチャートは常に確率論を意識すべき。指標から予想できない動きは必ず一定の割合で存在する。要はどうしようもない。

売買戦略をどうこうしようとせずに、予想できない動きでの上手い損切り戦略を考案した方がずっと良さそうです。

1941 2018-04-17 20:21:16 Moi je suis convaincu que oui! Ça va initier aux cryptos un paquet de gens qui ne s’y seraient pas intéressé rapidement  Une entreprise bien connue qu’on le veuille ou non c’est le 33 site le plus visité au monde!

1944 2018-04-17 20:21:08 Why are you always working with big chonas? He has a chart drawing ripple going to 4k sats . I kind of don't believe him anymore.
1945 2018-04-17 20:21:07 Im already using incognito mode, why would I care about paying with $crypto?

1949 2018-04-17 20:20:29 Con respecto al vuelo del NH-370 hay muchos mitos, y uno me llamo la atención  se dice que en ese viaje iba una comitiva con una suma muy importante en Crypto moneda  ( Bitcoin) y se desapareció sin dejar rastros.
1950 2018-04-17 20:20:25 seems like a trending pattern with banks.. talk shit about crypto then buy up
1951 2018-04-17 20:20:16 I think we can all give congrats to us all as crypto community (unless verge is scam) because more people see crypto being added more people will see it as a viable technology. 
For me, greatest progress is metamask which works as amazing internet wallet easy:)
1952 2018-04-17 20:20:11 Danke! Hoffentlich (:
1953 2018-04-17 20:20:09 hopefully crypto twitter is old enough to realize #4 and not come into this thread talking about Lebron being GOAT while he's down 0-1 in the first round to the damn PACERS

1956 2018-04-17 20:19:48 I still meet people every day who have no clue what Bitcoin is. But I bet they know what PornHub is! One of the biggest platforms to expose[] people to crypto! Good move for $XVG and anyone holding any crypto! I hold zero Verge...for now.
1957 2018-04-17 20:19:37 Just a H&S pattern on 30 minute view. Should hit around $7500 and hopefully with a dragon fly Doji pattern.
1958 2018-04-17 20:19:27 Het mooiste is dat de banken!! Niks met deze crypto te maken hebben! Geld dat kunnen we zelf wel regelen. Super blij dat #Vergecurrency dit bereikt heeft. Echte wereldwijde adoptie van een bankloze wereld!! Hoe meer pakken, hoe meer kosten!!
1959 2018-04-17 20:19:20 Thank you to everyone for getting this to the front page of a bigger crypto community.
1960 2018-04-17 20:19:20 This is a very cool and innovative project. This project in the future will be very helpful in the world of crypto. Hopefully this project is successful

1963 2018-04-17 20:19:04 Don't think we disagree about it being a valuable feature. Every personal computing should have hardware-bound encryption, firmware-enforced throttling / attempt limits, hardware-backed keys, etc.

None of it is inherently strong in the same sense as crypto + decent keys though.

1968 2018-04-17 20:18:31 It is a great investment for crypto in general. It might not be your cup of tea,  it is a direction forward.
This is what verge was meant for, online payments.
1969 2018-04-17 20:18:30 I don’t need help, you are asking for data that I don’t have access too.  I’m trying to help you and you have a brashness about you so you are welcome, show me the statements in 2020
1970 2018-04-17 20:18:30 It will promote the whole crypto space... it is showing coins can actually be adopted and used. It is good. I d have chosen lambos for the promo though to keep in line with the crypto theme...

1982 2018-04-17 20:17:29 One person shorted 1000+ BTC in no-time on BitFinex, that's all.

1986 2018-04-17 20:16:36 @_Crypto_Life I understand your concerns and why you feel this is something not to be proud of, but take it from this point, did you stop using $USD because its used to pay for adult content? $XVG is a currency and the fact that its been used this way shouldnt get you to step out
1987 2018-04-17 20:16:35 NY AG announced inquiry into 13 major crypto exchanges.
1988 2018-04-17 20:16:27 Sounds goddamn exciting though. Which is why I’m trying to get into it. Learning quite a bit from you all so appreciated!
1989 2018-04-17 20:16:25 I think “scam” is a poor description of today’s announcement.  It’s also debatable that @BigCheds was vindicated regarding the dump.  The story is far from written on that.  As of this tweet $XVG is down 3% today which is hardly a crash by crypto standards.  
1990 2018-04-17 20:16:19 Can someone help her out @SatoshiLite @bitcoin @coinbase @coindesk @CoinMarketCap @6BillionPeople @crypto @ForbesCrypto ??
1991 2018-04-17 20:16:13 Most of them must have been confused. They thought it was actually BTC you were going to talk about! Bcash=scam
1992 2018-04-17 20:16:00 Media claiming there is no easily identified catalyst? Take a freakin' picture!
1993 2018-04-17 20:15:54 Problem with Pornhub? Most use it for free which is why so many ads.
Those who do pay, don't want to jump through hoops to pay with crypto, that's if they even know what crypto is in the first place.

1996 2018-04-17 20:15:14 once a shitcoin always a shitcoin but i give them credit. mindgeek partnership is a legit big step for xvg and the whole crypto industry.
1997 2018-04-17 20:15:11 iedereen krijgt dit voor elkaar zolang je maar genoeg betaald, als je amazon 50 miljoen betaald om jou ( crypto) als betaaloptie te listen dan is dat ook geen probleem.
1998 2018-04-17 20:15:10 That is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read on crypto twitter, worse than the guy thinking verge was raising that $12M for partnering with Facebook haha. This is positive.
1999 2018-04-17 20:15:07 It makes sense that developers obtained this partnership. Sitting behind that screen all day. Treat yourself  #xvg #pornhub #takealoadoff #partnershit #Crypto

2016 2018-04-17 20:14:14 Yes exactly. Miners must constantly research new projects and new developments in mining software, mining algorithms, mining OS’s, and ASIC’s. It’s similar to the way that traders must constantly study charts.

2021 2018-04-17 20:13:50 Thank you.  I'll check it out and see how it goes as a crypto news source.
2022 2018-04-17 20:13:48 Please read all my posts. It’s good news for crypto but a poor execution of releasing the news pumping the price and promising massive news. Multiple adult websites accept crypto already

2031 2018-04-17 20:12:58 And still a lot of people dont really understand wtf this means for crypto,or they do but they dont want to admit it,cause there is so much hate on $XVG .Today the scam coin screamers are also fucked by #verge .For free.
2032 2018-04-17 20:12:57 yeah, i indulge arbitrary dislike constantly, so, i would never judge...

i think there's a crypto-median-britishness to your list though.. hard to explain but, it seems upper class northern island-ish.. I'm always seeing upper-class britishness/puritanism in americans though,so

2063 2018-04-17 20:09:13 The central banks are doing everything they can to discourage Crypto Currencies. Crypto takes money out of the Fiat system and out o their control. They do not like this 1 bit.

With so much noise in the space we could really use a source of reliable signal.
2085 2018-04-17 20:07:54 The porn industry has always dictated what technology gets adopted to real world use. This is great for @vergecurrency but also #crypto as a whole for adoption. You may not like Verge for your own reasons but mass adoption is a good thing for all crypto.
2086 2018-04-17 20:07:52 @sedarecruitment nice
2087 2018-04-17 20:07:45 IKR, I asked this merchant about accepting crypto currency. They said what's is that some  devil currency .. SMH!

2100 2018-04-17 20:06:30 @Kora_Network - read twitter! Well crypto content.
2101 2018-04-17 20:06:29 If u can’t see that this is a good thing for crypto in general not just for Verge then you’re blind. I am not shilling. It’s just all this hating on certain currencies from small day traders. You think the big whales cry this much or u think they see this as a good oportunity?
2102 2018-04-17 20:06:07 Thanks for the crypto updates.
2103 2018-04-17 20:06:06 Cool? Yeah, another reason to make crypto look like a joke. Super Cool...
2104 2018-04-17 20:05:58 Different OS’s have different available mining software, new algo’s require new settings, and always finding the next big play requires constant research. Not to mention the inevitable roadblocks that you run into almost every time you make changes to a working system lol.
2105 2018-04-17 20:05:57 Hi I'm Dickie, and I'm in Bristol, UK. I've just left an 18 year career in domain names to set up 2 new businesses in the #Crypto& #ICO space. Oh yes and I have a #Podcast #digiblogchat
2106 2018-04-17 20:05:56 Wow

2108 2018-04-17 20:05:45 It’s actually a fair bit of work.
2109 2018-04-17 20:05:37 I'm not. I was just trying to give you an idea of how massive it is for crypto. I want all of cypto to succeed and this is great for all of crypto, but alot of people are not full grasping what this means
2110 2018-04-17 20:05:37 One of the leading industries in the world and mass adoption for crypto... yea how stupid!!! /s

2118 2018-04-17 20:04:28 Makes sense. Increasing consumer addition is hard. The existing pool of capital already allocated to crypto is large enough to be worth fighting for. Volatility/risk is very high. Fighting the zero sum battle for existing dollars is bad on the long run but very logical.

2123 2018-04-17 20:03:52 Verge isn’t porn, Verge is a coin. Porn uses cash and credit cards too, will you burn those? Doesn’t make sense bro.
2124 2018-04-17 20:03:52 I feel like this happens all the time. Alt dip seems minor, so I decide to keep, then BTC decides to drop a bit more, aaaand alts are gone:)
2125 2018-04-17 20:03:41 Thanks for all your hard work supporting $XVG. Its totally your call if you want to be involved in a project and we should all respect that, I hope you don’t get too much stick for doing this hard fork 
2126 2018-04-17 20:03:31 It seems like Decentraland will be using a lot of crypto collectibles, so I'm interested to see what happens with that. I think the idea of owning a non-fungible digital item, instead of a coin or a token is REALLY cool. But it was only a casual interest until I heard about ND.
2127 2018-04-17 20:03:28 Not if you have more than a few rigs and you like to maximize profits. You have to use mining OS’s that fit your farm management needs, you have to switch OS sometimes as landscape changes. Then there’s the spec mining all kinds of algo’s and different mining software, etc.

2135 2018-04-17 20:02:48 how do you join your group ?
2136 2018-04-17 20:02:32 "besides maybe BTC"  -- you've kind of made my point.

The original tweet refers to the 'excitement' around today's Verge partnership (or any crypto partnership for that matter). They belie what those projects/coins lack naturally.
2137 2018-04-17 20:02:32 We are all children of someone but would you sell your daughter or son into that industry. I wouldn’t care how much money I would make I would never want to support that type of business even if I look at porn every night. CCN to me is the best source Crypto currency!

2142 2018-04-17 20:02:21 it seems that both @Pornhub and @Brazzers are now accepting @vergecurrency as (crypto)currency for payments. One year ago, a news like this one for #Ethereum would result in a +20% in 10 minutes :) maybe the ecosystem is really growing and maturing... #hope

2149 2018-04-17 20:01:29 Not feeling this ‘I told you so’ attitude on the #xvg news. Sounds like the school playground. 

Baby steps people, any adoption is good for #crypto in general. It’s a net positive for us all. Don’t be a hater.

Disclaimer: I hold no $xvg
2150 2018-04-17 20:01:27 Perhaps as marketing material to entice others to join your group or perhaps acquire more twitter followers.
2151 2018-04-17 20:01:27 I would call paying a company 3 million dollars to accept your crypto as a payment for a product people dont pay for a partnership

2160 2018-04-17 20:00:52 Ok, point taken. But still I feel like giving them congrats. Too much negativity in the crypto market. In the end in a few years time, the good cryptos will prevail. It’s a Darwinian environment but a touch of positivity won’t hurt anybody.
2161 2018-04-17 20:00:43 Not to mention every 16-70 year old male will now know what verge is and crypto currency within the year...thanks XVG

2189 2018-04-17 19:58:17 Here is another new project on the platform! If now the crypto-currency market is recovering, new projects will emerge as mushrooms after the rain, and I think many of them will prefer TokenGo.

2230 2018-04-17 19:55:12 @NikhilKal I enjoyed your talk on "Invest Like The Best" ... However, even suggesting Bitcoin is the best store of value we have in crypto right now is ludicrous. What about stable coins, like DAI?

Not so sure about this crypto$ thing.  Haven't yet seen anyone make heaps out of it, they just claim to increase the value of their "investment" but when I ask how many REAL $$$ they made, the reply is a shrug...

2245 2018-04-17 19:53:57 This is new MeToo movement. I am waiting for folks to sell and I have few grand  ready to roll in. Marketing gonna be huge with this partnership..with new users for Crypto.. I want to disappear but still enjoy all benefits with privacy and security..
2246 2018-04-17 19:53:39 I wouldn’t even put it into “tangible metrics”. A chart at face value, illustrates supply and demand, as well as the human behavior around it. Patterns in human behavior become evident within charts. Price action IS human behavior, charts are more than a guess! In my opinion !
2247 2018-04-17 19:53:33 I am fascinated with crypto-currency, but don't understand why my handle is attached to this tweet.

2249 2018-04-17 19:53:04 Everyone wondering why $XVG dumped upon the announcement... Pornhub probably sold their $65 mil xvg that was paid to them for endorsing Verge.

2250 2018-04-17 19:53:04 But @CNBCFastMoney said it was gonna rip after tax day. I dont understand. BK and Co are never wrong on the crypto's.
2251 2018-04-17 19:52:56 #investments #ethereum #Gamblica always keeps 20% of all GMBCs as a game fund, generating constant token flow on crypto exchanges. If you want to sell, there will always be players willing to buy GMBCs from you

2253 2018-04-17 19:52:49 I really do not understand why the community so reacted to the partnership with @Pornhub , because it's a big player and extremely profitable company! Such cooperation will give the whole crypto industry a great push to move forward! to the moon!
@vergecurrency #vergefam #pornhub
2254 2018-04-17 19:52:47 On 4/20 #crypto and #dank should be trending. Meaning #cryptodank is going to moon.
2255 2018-04-17 19:52:45 It's Trons "selling account" that sells millions of ETH intoTron on a daily basis. Sorta like a market maker account.  Have a look at @RolandS888 . He tracks the accounts actions daily and provides regular updates.
2256 2018-04-17 19:52:38 In reality, Qurrex is setting the industry standard in the crypto-economy for a universal cryptocurrency exchange – one which existing platforms will eventually achieve only after years of independent effort.

2258 2018-04-17 19:52:29 And I love it. This will get media attention like no other crypto before
2259 2018-04-17 19:52:19 A lot more demand than there is availability. Good news for investors.
2260 2018-04-17 19:52:16 People in crypto is probably not paying for porn. But other people are... for millions! So come on. This is a good thing. If any other cryptocurrency would partner with Pornhub you be happy. Your hate for XVG to much. Don’t get emotional in crypto.
2261 2018-04-17 19:52:15 I like it when Bankers tell me they don’t know what Crypto is.

2265 2018-04-17 19:52:10 Mindgeek is one of the leading payment processing companies out there. Look at how many people are on pornhub a day and a year. Its much more exposure than crypto has ever gotten

2280 2018-04-17 19:50:50 It's probably their own technology since it's their SoC.

Similarly, Qualcomm has their own qfuse technology which is used for some things like this for Qualcomm Crypto Engine along with it being how device vendors set up verified boot from a hardware root of trust.

2282 2018-04-17 19:50:48 Several high-profile ICOs have recently abandoned their communities post-ICO & the token price inevitably tanks. This is selfish, greedy and bad for #crypto.

Find an #ICO that treats you like gold.

The BIGGEST takeaway from my all my data is that better community = better ROI.
2283 2018-04-17 19:50:43 $NVCN badly oversold. Don't worry

Holy shit please just take us to 3k so we can clean this place.
2288 2018-04-17 19:50:25 Glad that I dumped pre-announcement. Crypto’s reputation isn’t helped exactly by this and Verge should not have assumed Hodlers were fine with such a partnership. Why not divulge before asking for donations?? Something is rotten hete.
2289 2018-04-17 19:50:25 ha, even worse. 97%+ infinite% at top accounts
2290 2018-04-17 19:50:20 見てたらお腹すいてきた！！
2291 2018-04-17 19:50:15 I think it's more about freedom of speech. People need to #DYOR Although I partially agree with your statement, I believe a lot of the crypto ad ban is a bit harsh & punishes an entire industry, on the actions of a few bad actors.
2292 2018-04-17 19:50:02 I love the partnership, it’s great for crypto.
2293 2018-04-17 19:50:01 Bought a new  $OCN another LTH - can’t wait to see the price of this one eoy  bags loaded

2296 2018-04-17 19:49:35 Did you buy the Verge top?
2297 2018-04-17 19:49:33 Daar heb je helemaal gelijk in ik ben ook beetje teleurgesteld eerlijk gezegt, ik had meer paypal of walmart ofzo verwacht maarja wie weet in de toekomst, het gaat mij niet om verge maar om crypto in het algemeen want hoe meer bedrijven geintreseerd raken in crypto hoe beter
2298 2018-04-17 19:49:33 only problem is paypal would not partner with xvg now because they are a partner of a porn site.  they would demand higher standards
2299 2018-04-17 19:49:14 Crypto is about financial sovereignty. You don’t have to like, care, or know about other crypto users. That’s the point. 
2300 2018-04-17 19:49:13 But what if that punching bag was so smart it could predict the crypto market?
2301 2018-04-17 19:49:11 Gotta sell in small chunks. I u wanne sell more. Coulf wait till its 110 sats then market sell down to 90 sats for example. Yea current price never reflects your sells in these

2305 2018-04-17 19:48:44 To all people who responds by "Who pays for porn?" Porn industry is valued between $40-$50 billion. I was skeptical and was completely out. But fact is a fact, they pulled one of the biggest deal in #crypto #VergePartnership #vergecurrency $XVG $btc #bitcoin

2311 2018-04-17 19:48:21 I didn’t know who mindgeek was at first and I never spend money on porn so it’s not something I would spend my verge on so it’s useless for me. However I do understand the exposer this will bring to verge. It will be a way of drawing more nocoiners into verge and crypto.
2312 2018-04-17 19:48:13 So they partnered with a multi-billion dollar company. Pornhub alone gets 65 million views per day. It's a good day for crypto currency and for mass adoption :) No need to be concerned for investors anymore.
2313 2018-04-17 19:48:02 Nice boys! Buy $xvg then jerk off to bitches we'll never hit IRL. I love the internet...
2314 2018-04-17 19:47:58 Yea yea exceed all expectations ... that’s why the coins value dropped by half ! Lol #xvg
2315 2018-04-17 19:47:48 fair enough! ya, no knows what will happen. what you said re: govt control of money has 100% been historically true, i just think the cat is out of the bag and crypto represents a serious challenge to concept of govt control of money
2316 2018-04-17 19:47:48 Visitors does bot equate to people on plant. 1 person could visit the site 10 times over a few days, that would be 10 visits.
2317 2018-04-17 19:47:38 4/4 I'm skeptical that maximal anonymization of pornography consumption is a good thing for our society, but I expect that to be where we're headed and it'd be foolish to not see today's announcement from @vergecurrency to constitute major progress down that path.
2318 2018-04-17 19:47:34 #Pornhub (major company #MindGeek) accepts #Verge #XVG, #xHamster accepts #DigiByte #DGB as their payment methods, #BitcoinZ #BTCz enables transfer via SMS...what a beautiful week in our #Crypto world.

2341 2018-04-17 19:44:41 Interesting. Maybe I'm just cynical but I don't think I agree with Hanlon's Razor, at least with crypto. People are greedy. Moreover I think, in practice, an awareness of the Greater Fool Theory alone is enough to turn stupidity to malice, or more likely some combo of the two
2342 2018-04-17 19:44:41 @EuropeanCryptoB   Yes, the popularity of crypto currency is growing every day. #europeanCryptoB #ethereum #btc # ripple #Banking #Blockchain #ICO #cryptocurrency
2343 2018-04-17 19:44:35 Finally @circlepay has come to their senses. They had a great platform, then destroyed it, and then circled back to support buying crypto with it again and even have more than BTC now. Check out Circle Invest.

2348 2018-04-17 19:43:49 What all you haters fail to realize is that this IS literally THE biggest partnership so far in crypto history. Aside from XRP I have yet to see anything even close to the magnitude of this partnership. @vergecurrency @justinvendetta #xvg

2351 2018-04-17 19:43:40 Lol, comparing pornhub to amazon? Idiot, I’m pretty sure amazon doesnt make all its money from advertising. Big picture, this isn’t that big. Say all you want this really doesn’t mean anything to help crypto. Keep your hopes up though! 
2352 2018-04-17 19:43:35 Its a war to get the first billion people onboarded. Nothing about crypto is inevitable. We need to fight to get this done.

Dont get me wrong, I love my crypto, but options....
2354 2018-04-17 19:43:19 Mr. Nye right tho. Is this really a positive for crypto? I don't think it is. Porns for losers
2355 2018-04-17 19:42:59 2/? That said, being drawn to what's bad for us is eminently human, and I don't think people should be made to feel so embarrassed about what turns them on that they need to employ a new kind of money like $XVG or $BTCP (fuck $FAP, $TIT, etc., so dumb) to get piece of mind.
2356 2018-04-17 19:42:56 The point is there are bigger things than pornhub that accept crypto already, we need way more adoption to make it actually go somewhere though. Crypto already is progressing! It's a matter of spreading the word like a virus.

2361 2018-04-17 19:41:59 It’s actually a software fork of one of my networks. Razor, the first 100% Tor-based crypto. All “dark” currencies are forked from my code. Just sayin.

2363 2018-04-17 19:41:45 I wonder how many of these idiots shilling $xvg right now are going to actually create and pay for a premium pornhub account with xvg?
Probably none cause they dumped their bags on all their "Lambo" dreaming followers

2365 2018-04-17 19:41:27 Yes all those people going to watch porn will click on the Verge ad and get into crypto instead of jerking off...
2366 2018-04-17 19:41:20 Thats my thought. Surely whole industry would be looking and considering options. Not judt sites, but adult stores and more. Once the ball starts rolling widespread adaption should follow
2367 2018-04-17 19:41:15  he look ugly as hell in that fit
2368 2018-04-17 19:41:12 Even with the Bcash lot here, the tone when I leave crypto Twitter, and enter Twitter of ordninaries makes me cringe.
2369 2018-04-17 19:41:10 Thank you for the recommendation, @XRPTrump; I agree that new investors should beef up on XRP's technical characteristics and the history - in crypto, it's always a good policy to learn more about your investment(s)!  
2370 2018-04-17 19:41:04 How are people disappointed?? I mean, this is a step further of crypto being accepted.. now we have the adult industry and other industries will follow! This is big for crypto community as a whole!! Y’all tripping
2371 2018-04-17 19:40:54 Yea they are the con artist tweens..  It's crypto man.. You gotta watch out!

2375 2018-04-17 19:40:17 Cal 3 is an interesting idea and to be honest, I think it would be a great thing if it were to pass. I must admit, my focus entirely shifted when I saw the tie @TimDraper was wearing and heard him mention blockchain. Hats off to this guy for continuously representing crypto.
2376 2018-04-17 19:40:14 We don't want or need your interference. You do nothing but pollute the waters. A heavy hand here will bite you in the future politically. NY lags in crypto precisely  because of this bs.

1/? Just to be clear, I am not pro-porn. Shit, I ain't even really pro-#crypto, or anything else really ... well, I am certainly pro-sex, I guess, but I'm still put off by the role #porn plays in our world these days. Porn is probably very bad for us.

2393 2018-04-17 19:38:50 Its kind of humorous how the tone with FUD spreaders around #Verge went from "Its an exit scam" to "They are announcing the announcement, how pathetic!" to "Its still a shitcoin". #VergeFam #YouWon $XVG #Congrats

Now that’s a HUGE achievement... can you imagine them buying a little #crypto out of curiosity and watching them green dildos grow? They gonna get addicted like you and me :) $btc $ltc $eth
2397 2018-04-17 19:38:24 How is this a partnership if they are just accepting  them as  a form of payment? And why would 75 mill xvg be needed to form this partnership?

2401 2018-04-17 19:38:18 why is it bad news? any pressure applied on exchanges to become more reliable and credible is a positive development for crypto

2403 2018-04-17 19:37:58 That's not a problem. That's the community being responsible and smart. Like everyone chipping in to pay for police, the fire department, bridges, roads, and sewer systems, to make the community a better place for everyone.

That $xvg took the first step to do something that will later on benefit all of the #crypto world. They decided to take action 

#vergefam #verge #xvg
2409 2018-04-17 19:37:32 The NY Attorney General office's Investor Protection Bureau sent letters to Coinbase's GDAX exchange, Gemini Trust, bitFlyer & 10 other crypto exchanges requesting they complete by May 1 a questionnaire on areas such as ownership, fees, trading suspensions and money laundering.
2410 2018-04-17 19:37:21 This was not acquired due to XVG ‘s phenomenal use case (dogecoin dark), it was most likely acquired via a fee! Also not the only crypto they accept...
2411 2018-04-17 19:37:16 Interesting to see lots of IOT related adds from @Huawei in my Twitter feed. Tomorrow @DomSchiener speaks about #IOTA in an event with them. Good news to come!! #iotasrong

2412 2018-04-17 19:37:16 One reason why private keys are so important to me is because they are one of the few things that can’t easily be taken away.
Phone numbers, bank accounts, formal financial access, etc can be taken away, on a whim, at somebody else’s discretion.

2416 2018-04-17 19:36:47 I was sub $3...  plus mining. But hey, I took some profits today and ready to reload if we drop back down. $$$ never get too attached to a project
2417 2018-04-17 19:36:43 So a small bag of Verge would mean? 
2418 2018-04-17 19:36:43 I pay for porn and I do none of that
2419 2018-04-17 19:36:42 How does this analogy relate to a crypto project — are they going to violently impose usage? Silly
2420 2018-04-17 19:36:37 Love your analysis and comments just wish a newbie like me could understand your charts and indicators a little better
2421 2018-04-17 19:36:35 i missed by $2
2422 2018-04-17 19:36:32 Today it is much easier to stream porn for free than paying for it with Verge. 

Focusing too hard on the similarities will cause you to miss the stark differences between these scenarios.

Great for crypto adoption as a whole tho #GoVerge #Vergecurrency

2426 2018-04-17 19:36:12 Huge problem with #crypto is the clarity from Governments on taxation, calculating your gains right now is hard work and I aint about hard work  $btc #Bitcoin
2427 2018-04-17 19:36:12 Since people also use fiat currency to pay for porn are you morally opposed to fiat currency too

2505 2018-04-17 19:27:30 Options are a big scam, insane that the government is regulating that but not crypto.

2510 2018-04-17 19:26:54 The point was, the entire crypto market cap went from $20bb to $820bb during his run.  That's a 41x.  Which means anyone with a properly diversified portfolio could have turned $100k in to $4.1mm (on average) WITHOUT getting free tokens or advice/tips from anyone.
2511 2018-04-17 19:26:51 You cannot pay subscription fees but other charges for premium content or one time fees that kind of thing. Volatility plays big role for crypto. We got to quickly move into new industries with marketing power and product enhancements that suits EVERY type of industry.

2513 2018-04-17 19:26:38 Respect Charlie! Like i said before, in the end all people in crypto are a community. When we all can create mass adoption crypto will be huge! #LTC #XVG
2514 2018-04-17 19:26:32 Please stop.  This is old news.  Just looking at the reaction of XRP vs other coins.  $XRP would have displaced $BTC if added to coinbase.   That is bad for @coinbase since they are a huge stake holder in BTC.
2515 2018-04-17 19:25:49 It’s about time you acted less jealous and hateful congratulations overdue @justinvendetta see this step forward for crypto as a whole #Vergecurrency

2523 2018-04-17 19:24:51 I am really sharing Terry's opinion here. I would not want to invest in this "part of the economy". There are way better options of investment in the crypto market, who are not devalueing woman.

2527 2018-04-17 19:24:08 For the first time in my crypto career I’m actually welcoming push backs in price to add more. Why? My time horizon has changed from speculation to belief that crypto is here to stay as an asset class and a store of value and a future currency.

2528 2018-04-17 19:24:04 Like they protected us from the Banks during the finanacial crisis .

2535 2018-04-17 19:23:24 Way to be true to yourself! When crypto becomes part of your life outside of social media, you have to be proud of what it stands for. Kudos 
2536 2018-04-17 19:23:14 Very good!!
2537 2018-04-17 19:23:05 This marketing makes me question my position in wabi.
2538 2018-04-17 19:23:04 I definitely don't. What makes crypto different?

2541 2018-04-17 19:22:12 I feel this. I can't work or someone who's work is fundamentally unethical. Crypto coins, arms manufactures, traffic shaping, high frequency trading, working for a major telco. While many of them have neat problems to work on, I don't think I could live with myself if I did.
2542 2018-04-17 19:22:04 Strong support at 7.1k-7.2k which I believe will determine it all.  If we fall below crypto will go to  for 2018. 
2543 2018-04-17 19:21:55 They’re good. It helps the community understand both sides
2544 2018-04-17 19:21:52 Ayyy look at Rand pickin up some EMA bands  good shit mate
2545 2018-04-17 19:21:50 Lovely picture!
Most people are here for Crypto/money, but aside from the important social changes this industry predicates, ultimately it's just a means to an end. CryptoTwitter needs more pics like this. Love is all that really matters.
2546 2018-04-17 19:21:47 Thanks @cryptoskeez!
2547 2018-04-17 19:21:47 Yes, i think it good for crypto. This will help people to decide what is the best project without looking at misleading advertisements.. which in turn gives more investment for good projects
2548 2018-04-17 19:21:41 I am designing a system based in a crypto  as part of my thesis, should I publish the paper  and maybe open source it or develop it silently before commercializing it?
2549 2018-04-17 19:21:07 I know people get mad when I post though charts but I only do it so people have the opportunity to take profit and accumulate more coins at the bottom. I never hold on to any coin. i sell at the top of a run and then rebuy again when its cheaper. never have an attachment to coins

2563 2018-04-17 19:19:21 Very good news for crypto. As a community we always cry for real use case n why we need one coin so it is big step towards mass adaption . I don't understand why people r crying. Grt work by Verge team.

2588 2018-04-17 19:16:39 Bots love crypto. It’s kinda their thing, along with Russians disinformation.
2589 2018-04-17 19:16:39 Possibly. What people seem to not realize is once a party can be linked to an address, EVERY transaction that party made can be traced and can never be deleted. The Government will love Crypto, due to it making taxaction and other government functions more efficient.

2599 2018-04-17 19:15:08 at this point xvg and trx are relying on investor psychology that leads people to overestimate the growth potential of these crypto assets with massive circulating supplies, while not noting that the resultant huge market cap hinders the ability for growth medium to long term.

2602 2018-04-17 19:14:52 New to crypto? Cover these basic things before you gamble at investing. 

1: You should own a hardware wallet. 

2: Install MetaCert's Cryptonite browser add-on to stop phishing sites 

3: Never give out your private key. 

4: 2FA via cell providers = attack vector

2613 2018-04-17 19:13:53 I think from a use case it'd be just as effective being adopted by the likes of @roomofsatoshi - the question really is, where does the investment returns come from with these 'partnerships' - what do you an investor in #xvg  get? Is this all about mass adoption and not profit?
2614 2018-04-17 19:13:51 @RBI Instead of banning crypto trading better you focus on cash shortage at various ATM's.
2615 2018-04-17 19:13:36 In that case, you can buy a supercar through Crypto Emporium. We accept $LTC, in case you haven't noticed yet.
2616 2018-04-17 19:13:35 Just a thought, no disrespect. if you would have sold at .85100 you would have had 3.0710 BTC to buy again at .00042043 You would then have 7,309 coins instead of holding on to 3600 ( which is still great my man) Just something to think about.

2627 2018-04-17 19:12:52 I agree. If Monero announced this partnership it would see much more positive reporting.
2628 2018-04-17 19:12:49 I see the crypto currency is paying off then.
2629 2018-04-17 19:12:47 That is not accurate. Medicare, Medicaid pay for the life style choices that result in cardiac disease, diabetes, etc. In addition, those with private policies pay rates based on population health. Unless you allow the uninsured to die on the st.,we all pay.

2644 2018-04-17 19:11:49 Marketing of cryptoassets as Money or as dApp platform? The Moneyness markets itself and takes years of pure time / Lindy effect to establish itself. Doesn’t matter which coin or dApp gets people into crypto. Eventually they compare security/decentralization/inflation and switch.

2670 2018-04-17 19:09:36 It is a positive move...and one of many to come. It now needs to be used, as #BTC for example was on the likes of #Expedia etc. and by all accounts the amount of use was low -> transition from investment to everyday coin/currency may take some time to become the norm

2719 2018-04-17 19:04:39 The hardest mental leap for people when they join crypto is the move from closed to open.

Code is worth nothing. Community is worth everything.

Anyone can fork the code. Very few people can fork a community.

Internalising that reality is just impossible for some people.


2720 2018-04-17 19:04:37 I have not been to crypto space for so long but very disapp. with all the small-minded users who have only one goal, to attack other users and their opinions. Each Coin has a reason to exist, if he has success lies with the respective project.

2729 2018-04-17 19:03:49 BTC is a more secure pedal than others right now, is my argument. Even if someone “enters the world of crypto” via ETH, they’ll see that other coin is more secure, decentralized, immutable and deflationary.
2730 2018-04-17 19:03:46 I know 100% for sure that bullish season is coming for alts, just look at btc dominance... it went from 47% to 41%..

2741 2018-04-17 19:02:42 Mindgeek are taking a risk in going into Crypto. 
Possibly they wanted the funds raised by Verge.
So not to lose the money if it does not work out.

think about that - this is putting the idea of paying for anything with crypto currency in front of millions of people every day...i still just don’t understand why all the hate...

2810 2018-04-17 18:57:44 I love litecoin cuz it’s the first crypto I bought and has caused me to read more than I ever have before

2812 2018-04-17 18:57:34 Verge's acceptance as a mode of payment on Pornhub is a pivotal moment for $Crypto's in general. Although this move will be laughed off as no one pays for porn but for me personally, it's very critical. This will drive further mass adoption of #cryptocurrency in new markets! $XVG
2813 2018-04-17 18:57:33 Normally I would agree 100% with this sentiment, but perfect selfie with a smokin' hot chica in Paris may, in fact, be the only known exception.
2814 2018-04-17 18:57:28 Porn and crypto got knocked up #xvg #moon #thisisthebeginning
2815 2018-04-17 18:57:27 Re: crypto & taxes - procrastination and the need to use profits or potential funds to pay other taxes outside of crypto should not be underestimated.

Though I think tax REFUND day (roughly 3 weeks) will be a much bigger boom to the market. Anybody else?
2816 2018-04-17 18:57:22 I would assume the majority of crypto traders that plan on paying taxes have already liquidated and thus reflected in the price action.
2817 2018-04-17 18:57:18 Is this verge? If so,
Oh how I’d love to see the faces of all those smug investors now. I wonder why pornhub went with them
2818 2018-04-17 18:57:13 Didn't they already announce it though?
2819 2018-04-17 18:57:06 I am among those who would do without this industry.  However, equivocating a cryptocurrency with fiat is a crucial step to freeing the public from the invisible tax that is monetary manipulation.  I would really like to see a broader application of crypto than this one.  Step 1
2820 2018-04-17 18:56:52 Can you name another vendor this size with this many platforms that accepts BTC or any other crypto? You may hate the coin and porn, but unlike the vast majority of coins out there now, this coin can actually now be USED for something besides trading back and forth on exchanges.

2824 2018-04-17 18:56:31 I believe it pumped this morning because of Reddit rumors of the Alibaba partnership. However, @Waltonchain's twitter hasn't officially announced anything yet. My targets are a contingency plan for if the official twitter announces the partnership
2825 2018-04-17 18:56:30 This guy a piece of work. Has no idea about crypto just like he had no idea about DFS when he went after that for a publicity stunt. He should be removed from office

2827 2018-04-17 18:56:05 This right here. You should have known your beliefs would come in to play at some point. Its best you just leave crypto because it aint for you bud.
2828 2018-04-17 18:56:03 I can feel how disappointed you are....
2829 2018-04-17 18:55:58 Hey trader, how do you reconcile using a coin for a service (XVG) and every time you make a payment you have to pay tax on it??? This property tax deal for crypto just plain sucks for coins you can use to make payments. Would be good for you to tell people about this if you know
2830 2018-04-17 18:55:46 You probably should have already said this like last month.  Last minute morality clause? If you say so....
2831 2018-04-17 18:55:41 if more people actually knew what it takes - regulations & integrations that’s required - to build a bank or control the flow of money, they’d support crypto as an alternative medium of exchange, instead of just seeing it as another get rich quick scheme

2851 2018-04-17 18:53:50 If you want freedom for everyone you have to accept the freedom of those whom you don't ethically agree with, in most instances. The technology of verge can still do all that you desire (I as well), this will open more doors for other coins to do so.

2856 2018-04-17 18:53:32 2a) I'm not from US and I think we have a different interpretation of "marketing"

2b) Majority of the world does not own crypto yet, and the value of crypto is based on market consensus. To maintain or increase its adoption (hence value) marketing and education are required.

2860 2018-04-17 18:53:12 Stand for something or fall for anything. To NOT let monetary things affect your morals/ethics, even when it will multiply in value, I think anyone can respect that. I do hope you find a coin out there that does fall into what you hope out of a coin. Good luck!
2861 2018-04-17 18:53:09 Silly to judge $xvg and not judging the $usd the same. Feel free to burn all your USD that is financing all porn and even worse ... war !

2873 2018-04-17 18:52:18 Non là c'est autre chose. Si une crypto trouve un cas d'usage, quel qu'il soit, c'est positif pour elle. D'autant plus si c'est sur un marché gigantesque. Ce n'est même pas une question d'effet d'annonce mais bien de trouver des usages aux cryptomonnaies. Donc positif pour moi.

2875 2018-04-17 18:52:09 Now, good on them for paying for the partnership and getting it. I just don't understand how this is a "perfect" use case as some are hailing it. Either way, yes something like this still helps crypto as a whole. Any adoption is good and porn is a huge industry.
2876 2018-04-17 18:52:07 What ever you saying @ZeusZissou about this deal you know it is a really big deal for the whole crypto market to have to lighten up the tech for the main stream people. This will bennefit the whole crypto space
2877 2018-04-17 18:52:03 Crypto brings velocity back to money. (Corruption kills velocity.)

But hey, you knew that, right?

2917 2018-04-17 18:48:44 as i stated yesterday and today. this is bigger than $XVG. this is a huge win for the entire #crypto community. this means that doors will be opened for other coins and tokens to ink deals and partnerships.
2918 2018-04-17 18:48:41 LOL
2919 2018-04-17 18:48:39 Yeah, the CABAL is really manipulating Crypto right now...
2920 2018-04-17 18:48:33 Off course it won’t be only Verge that’s why they said For the First time in crypto! They are just the first to be integrated.
2921 2018-04-17 18:48:26 Happened a few hours ago. Market don’t care

3046 2018-04-17 18:37:41 1/ I'm no $XVG fanboy, but I do see a lot of backhanded compliments about their partnership announcement today. Despite the shady way of crowd sourcing the capital for this partnership it would seem to me that there are a lot of people throwing excessive FUD around it.
3047 2018-04-17 18:37:14 Great job @justinvendetta !
The next few months will show the power of $XVG $Verge

3052 2018-04-17 18:36:51 "Exceeds all expectations" ... respectfully disagree. Smh
3053 2018-04-17 18:36:33 If it was $btc that got this partnership everybody will be hailing but since its $xvg, they would rather hate. Nonetheless this is a big step for all crypto towards mass adoption. One step at a time.
3054 2018-04-17 18:36:32 By manipulative you must be referring to @WhalePanda’s egregiously foul medium articles which smear BCH ppl w/all sorts of dubious, grossly exaggerated accusations.

Roger’s tweet=PR spin at worst, the other outright malicious slander. But can a brainwashed cultist see the diff?
3055 2018-04-17 18:36:30 here's a look at the new technology and the idea of this company, I loved everything in this crypto world, you will learn and understand the benefits!

3056 2018-04-17 18:36:19 Crypto’s global by default and basically impossible to shut down design necessitates thoughtful and creative regulatory approaches. The IMF has been even keeled and that will prove beneficial to regulators/states as well as the ecosystem.
3057 2018-04-17 18:36:16 Thanks Charlie. We crypto people must support eachother other

3060 2018-04-17 18:35:53 i don't hold any xvg but it is case with all crypto. They usually dump hard after news is out, also it nearly at same price as it was 24 hours ago

3066 2018-04-17 18:35:10 Holy crap, verge coin has taken over the whole porn industry. This is absolutely a crypto game changer!
3067 2018-04-17 18:35:08 Never never never any upcoming crypto exchange in Middle East ever will list XVG token. Where the big money lays everyone knows... funnily exactly this countries are working hard in egoverment and blockchain integration... that’s pretty awkward. Unethical to rip of own xvg folks.

3072 2018-04-17 18:34:37 fair play to @justinvendetta and @vergecurrency, the promised us all a big announcement and they delivered..... this is just the start for Verge and crypto as a whole. #Cryptocurrency
3073 2018-04-17 18:34:36 interesting timing
3074 2018-04-17 18:34:33 I do agree. No need for 100 crypto currencies. You don’t think #LiteCoin can scale? What currency do you think is most adaptable and practical? #BlockchainTechnology I do like #ICX #ven maybe #LUXCoin ?

3086 2018-04-17 18:33:33 That pretty much sums up all my friends and family at the moment regarding their attitude to crypto. I’ve only got a small portfolio (under $1000) and would like to grow it to at least double. I think it’s very possible and doable.
3087 2018-04-17 18:33:32 U still like Request Network?
3088 2018-04-17 18:33:25 I don't think people realise yet how revolutionary this will be for crypto.
3089 2018-04-17 18:33:16 How much did they pay for this board position? 

They are very anti-crypto in the news and so was the exec I met at the code-a-thon.

Will @Discover:

1 Open #Bitcoin buying on credit?
2 Accept #crypto 4 bill pay?
3 Launch bit-reload debit?

@ChamberDigital got some splainin 2 do
3090 2018-04-17 18:33:15 The total amount of wallets is an arbitrary indicator as everyone has multiple wallets (private+exchanges). Everyone in crypto has btc wallets, not everyone has even a single ripple wallet. Your counter indicator is not thought through.

3104 2018-04-17 18:31:30 Exactly what I said .....
3105 2018-04-17 18:31:30 Nice job, well done....one day a lot of the haters will realize what this means for crypto-exposure!! 
3106 2018-04-17 18:31:23 So you don't see potential for the only anonymous payment system for porn after being dumped after a major pump climbing back out as user adoption rises?
3107 2018-04-17 18:31:23 Bruh tell me why I wake up to the news that pornhub partnered up with one of the crypto currencies I’m invested in 
3108 2018-04-17 18:31:15 Well said, @SatoshiLite. 

And you're right. As a Forbes article stated, "once the porn industry embraces a technology, that technology tends to begin to thrive"

This is good for all of crypto; not just Verge $XVG

3114 2018-04-17 18:31:01 1) Same people who created the FED & introduced fractional Reserve lending, derivatives, and futures are what you call financial engineers. Now with the invention of the internet and expensive software they can engineer a crash & a boom. Crypto was planned long time ago by them
3115 2018-04-17 18:30:51 Crypto is just slang for blockchain which is a particular design within financial cryptography.
3116 2018-04-17 18:30:49 #JoyToken #Crypto #Blockchain #Crowdfunding Is a marketplace similar to Apple’s App store. Developers who create modern games can get customers more easily and earn money in “real-time” because the games are played.

3122 2018-04-17 18:30:24 I agree Charlie.

Regardless of what coin it is, it's good for crypto overall. The more attention and mainstream acceptance we see, the better.
3123 2018-04-17 18:29:59 H&S on 4 hours, what do you think?
3124 2018-04-17 18:29:42 I'll tell you this... the way I got into crypto is while buying viagra from an Indian drug store.   Porn might not be reputable, but it's a HUGE market.  Good for Verge!  PS.  I literally only have 200 VGX so I'm not a crazy fanboy!
3125 2018-04-17 18:29:40 タダ乗りかもしれないし、わたしは一人ではなにもできない半端者かもしれないが、ただ誘われたら始めたのでなく、自分にとって素敵でやる価値のあることだとおもったから関わらせていただくことにした。とにかく成功させたい。
3126 2018-04-17 18:29:31 Counts seems not working for crypto. Previous counts never finished and i lost when we dropped wave 5 and started with wave 1-2

3128 2018-04-17 18:29:29 Crypto wollen sie ja auch verbieten und reglementieren...
3129 2018-04-17 18:29:20 what is pound-backed crypto anyway?
3130 2018-04-17 18:29:16 A success beyond expectation, I believe it will be a potential project later, let's grow stronger in the future. #EXPORTONLINE, #EXPORTONLINEICO, #EXON, #Crypto, #Blockchain
3131 2018-04-17 18:29:15 This definitely thrusts crypto into more fertile grounds
3132 2018-04-17 18:29:12 I think thats an impossible question to answer. Give it a week or so for the dust to settle and let it go sideway for a bit and then we will know were it stands.

3156 2018-04-17 18:26:50 Correct. It was hyped to change the game and be the biggest announcement in crypto yet. I don't think it's bigger than MoneyGram and Western Union finishing up xRapid pilots in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't change my life at all. I don't pay for porn. LOL

3165 2018-04-17 18:25:37 $xvg partnership is bullish for all of crypto. Let the day traders take their profit, we will BTFD and verge will hit $1 this summer.

3178 2018-04-17 18:24:52 Verge partners with pornhub. Crypto is the only space where an incumbent called by everyone a scam ends up making a deal like that.

And they say crypto won't survive.

3188 2018-04-17 18:24:12 She’s been singing this tune since 2014!! It was her bullish statements on crypto that allowed me to get my economics masters thesis on bitcoin approved by my department back in 2015.
3189 2018-04-17 18:23:53 Great idea Pornhub to use the BEST privacy crypto currency in the market, great partnership for both parties!

3196 2018-04-17 18:23:06 Use case . Why xvg can have long term position in crypto

Credit where credit is due man, 90% of the crypto bros we’re convinced they were pulling an exit scam. Bigger picture.

3205 2018-04-17 18:22:01 Every man and his dog will be buying up $XVG in the coming days and weeks. Not just to pay for their porn but because of this insane publicity. @justinvendetta was right, this is fucking massive. Never doubted him for a second. Best fucking dev in crypto.
3206 2018-04-17 18:21:53 Because if this chain of argumentation is correct, then each store offering payments through for example Master Card would be a partner of theirs. Which is simply not true.
3207 2018-04-17 18:21:44 36/36 @pornhub is about to get so many more people interested in #crypto than every single token airdrop ever performed, plus it's going to be a way more diverse group. Many people will remember learning how to buy and sell $XVG because they were horny. 
3208 2018-04-17 18:21:41 And the drop has started  lol mc coffie, just fuck off crypto space for good please
3209 2018-04-17 18:21:39 That explains why @officialmcafee seemed more crypto-scammy than normal yesterday...

Thanks #TokenPay for making the #VergeCurrency partnership happen

3219 2018-04-17 18:20:23 Don't get me wrong, it's cool @Pornhub accepts crypto now, but $XVG? Really? There's not an easy way to buy it. You end up losing money through transaction fees by the time you get your coins. And risk losing more if prices drop from BTC or ETH before you can trade to $XVG.

3229 2018-04-17 18:19:17 Come on man.. I'm following you since the day I got into crypto and have always appreciated your wisdom. This is a great thing for Verge and crypto in general. Mass adoption incoming.
3230 2018-04-17 18:19:11 Same but with #crypto ? I’ll accept that challenge. Still an amateur though but it will be an awesome way to learn.
3231 2018-04-17 18:19:09 great!!! GO CRYPTO
3232 2018-04-17 18:19:04 Yes
3233 2018-04-17 18:19:04 I wonder what your problem is?

If you are really into Blockchain and Crypto, you would have accepted this and should have been happy, whoever they were partnering with.

You are the problem real company's stay away from Crypto.
3234 2018-04-17 18:18:57 So Im failing to see a negative with @Pornhub & @vergecurrency partnership. This is the first REAL mass adoption for crypto. This is HUGE. No other crypto can be used in the real world like this. Its only a matter time b4 other companies adopt verge and other crypto. #verge #xvg

3248 2018-04-17 18:17:57 I agree! This is exactly why major corporations are reluctant to integrate crypto, insane volatility and constant bickering. Lets all just be friends! There isn't room for 1500 coins/tokens - but certainly for 5?
3249 2018-04-17 18:17:48 @CryptosR_Us Do you think this marketing of Pornhub - XVG isn't worth 2M $? I haven't seen something like this before in crypto

3262 2018-04-17 18:16:41 In fact, at these events are businesses researching and looking for more information about blockchain possibilities.

Will users be able to directly buy XVG for use within the Mindgeek sites?

For most users buying crypto via fiat to crypto exchange, then to a crypto exchange is a tad much.

Is there anything in the works to allow users a way to directly buy XVG?
3268 2018-04-17 18:15:55 naturally, as the UK banks have blocked everybody from buying crypto.

3273 2018-04-17 18:15:43 the last gap is @ .0076 & usually after a gap fill it will hit the next support. The gap @ .00813 is a very powerful one cause its on the 12hr. This has a small chance of turning around now & never filling in the gaps. Its not an exact science but i wont bet against it myself
3274 2018-04-17 18:15:42 Think of it as a wikipedia, its a decentralized search engine. So you don't rely on a a centralized team to guide you to what you are searching for rather than your peers and the masses guide you. makes sense to me.

also high liquidity, low spreads, advanced technical analysis tools, price warnings

I think they could have done a better job with marketing & stating things like "this will bring a positive light to crypto" was a bit much.. all the best to verge...

3289 2018-04-17 18:14:24 Beyond IoT (still waiting for a robot martini maker!) you can see my article on journos and crypto companies - most of us don't get paid enough to do an interview, transcribe, read a 70-page whitepaper then put into an article, thus creating the industry challenges
3290 2018-04-17 18:14:20 To be fair, the first couple months, earlier last year, there was wide variety in the types of messages, although I found them quite infrequent (despite being on 2 dozen "lists"). Now, it's 95% ICOs
3291 2018-04-17 18:14:07 $xvg provides the method of payment, pornhub provides the users. Whatcha mean?

Questioning a project's fundamentals and team is not "FUD," unless that stands for "FOMO, Usual Dump"

My follower count will dump worse than xvg's price today.
So much effort I put in making this a 'credible account'.
And then I end up as a porncoin hodler, making bad jokes. Welcome to crypto. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3306 2018-04-17 18:12:57 Orwellian is the perfect way to describe it. It's crazy how closely your views on crypto mirror my own.

My friends say I'm too pessimistic on it, I say it's just because I study history.
3307 2018-04-17 18:12:50 Hey @DiaryofaMadeMan can we see a portfolio update?
3308 2018-04-17 18:12:49 I believe it’s because it’s not a decentralized cryptocurrenxy, plus other requirements. I know coinbase releases something stating what what the requirements were before getting listed on the exchange
3309 2018-04-17 18:12:43 ‘There is a magnitude scale of wealth, and a lot of greed we should get rid of. When you earn money in crypto, remember where you come from and do some social good,’ @JeffPulver about $3 trillion opportunities on crypto market. #blockchain #Tokenization #decentralization – bij Computer History Museum
3310 2018-04-17 18:12:41 It seems like you dont know what you’re talking about. If you understood crypto you would not be talking this way. Google up blockchain would ya
3311 2018-04-17 18:12:35 Furthermore, it’s pretty nice seed to plant. What if the coins that end up succeeding and capturing the public’s eye aren’t the ones the crypto elite expect, what if that’s the great thing about it all?
3312 2018-04-17 18:12:34 35/? @vergecurrency gives users the privacy while @pornhub gives them the access, so this is gonna be a match made in heaven, with parts assembled in hell (but, like, the kinky fun hell, not the eternal pain and suffering hell).
3313 2018-04-17 18:12:32 There are so many people pretending to be saints here that it's ridiculous. But it's well known that hypocrisy and double standars abound in crypto. Thank you @vergecurrency , I believe in you

3325 2018-04-17 18:11:34 I think people just set their expectations too high. This partnership definitely has potential to bring crypto to new heights.
3326 2018-04-17 18:11:28 It’s the biggest industry man. Don’t fool yourself. This is really big! However, your comment is a little funny though 
3327 2018-04-17 18:11:16 that would be great
3328 2018-04-17 18:11:14 That’s it. To achieve Massadoption it needs users. VERGE is reaching 100 million users a day! Let it sink in for a while.. This is what every cryptocurrency wants to achieve and VERGE has done just that! #boemboemdingen #cryptocurrencynews

3333 2018-04-17 18:10:48 With so many people not insured, ending up in the ER etc. we're all paying.  It's not 0%, that's inaccurate at best.   IMO, it's much better for everyone to pay a little and be covered.  We do it for car insurance.  It's no different.

A week or so later I sent him .06 just so he'd have a full 1.0 #LTC. He was so excited to see #LTC come in, but he  didn't know who sent it... It was fun!

3348 2018-04-17 18:09:57 Nowhere in the tweet does it say it's a Bitcoin Cash event, all @rogerkver said was that it was BCH supporters.

@WhalePanda more interested in being a troll propagandist rather than properly understanding English. A quick look at his mudslinging medium articles confirms this.

3351 2018-04-17 18:09:28 Lol.. Zzzz. That fud is getting old. We should all support eachother other when mass adoption news for crypto as this happens. Its good for all of us, no matter what coin you owe
3352 2018-04-17 18:09:26 I will admit I was losing confidence in XVG. I know you never did DG, but I wasn’t sure. This announcement is huge though. Hopefully it makes an even bigger impact on Crypto and it’s adoption.

3361 2018-04-17 18:08:37 Quick question for @HRBlock - why are you telling people that crypto sales are like-kind exchanges, and therefore they can defer their taxes? This is blatantly false, yet I've spoken with multiple people who were advised by your employees to do so #crypto #btc #xrp #eth #ltc #bch

3392 2018-04-17 18:06:20 33/? Most every #porn consumer desires more privacy than is currently possible. Humanity's lascivious dispositions have certainly driven the maturation & adoption of several technologies, but only when the tech provides additional privacy, like #XVG will via @pornhub
3393 2018-04-17 18:06:16 but zrx said they will not provide a public orderbook, but more for crypto - crypto exchange ('market buying')
3394 2018-04-17 18:06:01 A temporary recovery from a bear market would mean it spikes after a period of time where it has gone down. For example if it went from 15¢ to 8¢ spike to 12¢ then continue even lower than 8¢ right??

3453 2018-04-17 18:01:37 Where do you get all your information on learning about this form of TA? My initial question would be why does the gap need to be back down to the .007 mark, couldn't a gap be filled at around the .01 .008 mark just as well and start the new leg up? Interesting stuff for sure!

3461 2018-04-17 18:01:11 Why silver though ? Isn't gold the pm they stack more of ? 
Granted big stacks of silver look cool. I have been getting into the dollar vigilantes channel on youtube. He reckons crypto and pms are going to be safe haven assets.

3465 2018-04-17 18:00:59 So this #xvg thing....
If I was to go on #pornhub (not that I would) cough cough
You can now pay for stuff via #xvg
Would payment be instant? If not it seems pointless.
When I send crypto from binance it normally takes up to an hour.
Just wondering how it works?
3466 2018-04-17 18:00:55 Get on it @CryptoDale. Bully need a fresh buy.

3475 2018-04-17 18:00:19 US won’t forfeit its position as world tech leader.. if it does, other countries will dominate this space

yes, early adopters are rewarded for risk in crypto but this won’t stay like this forever

i think the examples of Zimbabwe and Venezuela are strong ex. of positive impact

3485 2018-04-17 17:59:43 Really, I don’t know ANYONE that pays for porn!  You are right in that it is great exposure for crypto in general, but for verge, I just don’t see it as a booster.
3486 2018-04-17 17:59:34 I think "rogue nations" i.e. those that don't support the petrodollar system will try crypto first and fail. Then once USD collapse as a reserve currency, China, IMF, etc. will jump in with a crypto reserve (maybe backed by gold) for starters... then who knows what Sovereigns do.
3487 2018-04-17 17:59:29 Absolutely.  This will not be an overnight success, nothing good ever is.  This could take months to affect prices, but this is one of the best partnerships I have seen in crypto.
3488 2018-04-17 17:59:23 Exactly what I said before. It will introduce folks to crypto and that's good for everyone

3497 2018-04-17 17:58:54 The purpose of a crypto currency is that its decentralized and anyone/group can use it.  It doesn’t need any partnership for use.  “Partnership” announcement is used to pump the coin.

3505 2018-04-17 17:58:25 K sounds good, I didn’t own any $WAN at the time, hense BTFD - don’t assume
3506 2018-04-17 17:58:13 Wow!! It amazes me how many investors that don’t have their ears to the ground and are oblivious to the fact of trends. Vice industries is a crypto currency that pays you to watch porn. Yes the porn industry is a multi billion dollar industry but people don’t pay to watch porn!!!
3507 2018-04-17 17:58:11 I'm taking the exact same strategy, I'd like to be able to capitalize in some way if it goes up or down.
3508 2018-04-17 17:58:06 does not help when you make lambo music videos, make videos called 'from 6 figure slave to crypto millionair, being a crypto expert on different shows and then having your private keys stored in fucking evernote.
3509 2018-04-17 17:57:55 the dude made his money on an ICO investment and all of a sudden he’s a god amongst the crypto community. it could have easily gone the opposite for him.
3510 2018-04-17 17:57:49 How do I get that indicator?
3511 2018-04-17 17:57:37 I disagree. You’re missing the point. Verge is a privacy coin; this will enable users to make payments anonymously, which is important to some people in a industry like this. #crypto
