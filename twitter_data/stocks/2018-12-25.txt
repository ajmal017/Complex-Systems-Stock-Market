1 2018-12-25 23:59:15 They would have gone out of business in 2008, but we wrongly bailed them out. And that was because they were targeting and lying to low income communities about houses and stocks.
2 2018-12-25 23:58:48 Better have the clothes i want in the stocks when i wake up
3 2018-12-25 23:58:35 Its an SPY call. I still think cannabis stocks are broken from a technical standpoint. And by call I mean call option. I don't buy stocks, only options. Better R/R profile, at least for me.
4 2018-12-25 23:58:29 Stocks falling. 2 immigrant children have died. Wages stagnant. Government closed. People uninsured.  Roads & bridges crumbling. Get off media & get to work
5 2018-12-25 23:57:36 Fed Reserve is tanking stocks not Trump..only the liberal sheep will buy this lie.
6 2018-12-25 23:57:11 Get out of stocks folks....fair warning
7 2018-12-25 23:56:25 My mom is a prime example. She literally would pick stocks from the brands she likes shopping  
Made a ton in the bull market. Told her to dump 2 months ago and while she was resilient she came out on top.
I’m sure other moms are in way worse position lol.
8 2018-12-25 23:56:11 I love "YouTube University" It changed my life. I learned how to day trade stocks by watching lots of videos and QUIT my job. I mean WHO needs college  You can learn to do ANYTHING on YouTube.
9 2018-12-25 23:56:05 I've largely stopped even trying to make the case. If I was 65 with six or seven figures in stocks I'd probably think Mattis could save us too

11 2018-12-25 23:55:34 Yen is actually weak asf. Stocks down  20% oil down 40% yield curve is almost inverted but yen is only up 3-4 pc...
12 2018-12-25 23:53:23 My system doesn’t catch the top or the bottom. By 10-3-2018, leading stocks had deteriorated significantly even though all time highs were a few % away.  My system will flash a “low risk” alert when the time is right.  I’ll be waiting until then.
13 2018-12-25 23:53:02 Great. STOCKS 'n shares!
14 2018-12-25 23:52:37 Yes but stocks show you their daily and  annual performance regardless of if they go up or down, touts not so much.
15 2018-12-25 23:52:07 -Stocks in free fall.
-Syria left unprotected.
-America’s armed veterans quitting left and right.
-The government is shutdown at the hands of a giant infant.

Merry Christmas!
16 2018-12-25 23:51:48 Most stocks I look at are so oversold and due for bounce. Any kind of a significant good news headline would ignite a rip your face off rally. Things have been quiet on the China Trade War front for a while now.....
17 2018-12-25 23:51:41 that there is a low degree of correlation between the traditional stocks and bitcoin/crypto ;)
18 2018-12-25 23:51:18 So tommorow people will have 2 concerns taking back gifts or refunds & stocks, 401ks & how bad will the Dow Jones be? Wake up your financial security is at risk!
19 2018-12-25 23:51:04 Over a year ago when I talked about the records the market was breaking you said you didn't care cause you didn't own any stocks. Now that it's doing bad you say you do own stocks.

40 2018-12-25 23:50:44 Stocks are still way overvalued... Don't let anyone say otherwise
41 2018-12-25 23:50:41 Ah yes so your mom 1v1d with Jesus final destination and took all of his stocks. If course classic christmas tradition -Tanner
42 2018-12-25 23:50:19 My stocks are 16% down this year. Fix your shit.
43 2018-12-25 23:50:18 La rumeur de pénurie de croquettes pour chats provoque une rupture de stocks. Les consommateurs font des réserves.

46 2018-12-25 23:48:18 Shorting should at least be banned from penny stocks until 3 years of profits are achieved.
Shorting creates dilution and penalises long term investors.
47 2018-12-25 23:47:41 He blames the fed. for the downturn in stocks. Can’t admit it that the volatility in the market is because of his trade wars, fake negotiations with foreign governments, and his back and forth policies
48 2018-12-25 23:47:06 #DJIA Nobody benefits from a long-term bear market. Global central banks have the ability to manipulate stock prices to the upside. Therefore, a 40% to 60% decline seems rather unlikely. #Stocks
49 2018-12-25 23:46:43 Cool les gars merci, j'ai plus de stocks de protections vous pouvez m'en livrer minute via glovo ?
50 2018-12-25 23:46:37 Yes, and my stocks now stink and if mine stink so do  everyone’s Super and life savings. Bill may inherit a disaster ready for him to make it even worse.  I truly fear for the future. I’ll go back and watch the cricket.
51 2018-12-25 23:44:41 Stocks? U usually mention those too
52 2018-12-25 23:44:22 Stocks & Bonds: Holiday Rest, but Little Relaxing, as Traders Size Up the Stock Market
53 2018-12-25 23:44:19 HIGHBEAM UNITY stocks rallying
54 2018-12-25 23:43:37 maybe some oil stocks to go along with bios?
55 2018-12-25 23:42:21 Yeshhh! Either you own the stocks if you like it or you don't. And you buy other things or buy competitors stocks. Shorting is not investing
56 2018-12-25 23:40:10 Then it’s time deplorables to buy stocks.
57 2018-12-25 23:39:11 Wall Street in 2018:

Jan:                We love stocks 
March:           We love stocks 
May:               We love stocks
July:               We love stocks
August:         We love stocks

December:   No way.  Stocks are too risky


58 2018-12-25 23:38:35 If I've been around for the last three or four financial crises, stocks won't stop falling until govt comes up with some really grandiloquent acronym
59 2018-12-25 23:38:29 Monday the FANGs went green first before other major stocks before going red again after Trump’s FED tweet. Cramer says that is the sign of a bottom when FANG has relative strength.

61 2018-12-25 23:37:12 @POTUS - stocks market is not doing well. How am I supposed to ever retire?
62 2018-12-25 23:36:26 Do you think also the stock market is doing great ? Not tweeting anymore about ATH in the stocks ? Not so many good trade deals if the FED is hiking interest rates and you are not making the deal with China . Do your job !!!!!!!
63 2018-12-25 23:36:17 Hahaha...please do so us shorts can drive you into bankruptcy.  Most stocks need to be cut in half to  be fairly valued.
64 2018-12-25 23:35:37 I think it’s nice how Robinhood is festive with the falling snowflakes on the homepage today- almost totally makes me forget about the ginormous L’s all my stocks took at the end of this near record low year :-)
65 2018-12-25 23:35:21 There is one and only 1 SAM$$$$ He is better than Anyone in the OPTIONS MARKET! Sam should be on OPTION ACTION. But he won't play there GE,BAC,AMAT,MU  OR NKE LOSER stocks.
66 2018-12-25 23:34:38 Apparently no one on twitter gets excited about the opportunity to buy stocks at a discount
67 2018-12-25 23:34:09 Oh America is doing so well: another child has died, stocks took a dive, a government shutdown due to the President throwing a tantrum and the list goes on.
68 2018-12-25 23:32:54 On the other hand the crash in the stock market may also trigger bank failures. Many banks hold stocks as a large portion of their balance sheet. If we start to see bail-ins of bank deposits this will more than likely be bullish for Bitcoin.
69 2018-12-25 23:32:38 I haven’t seen any new trade deals approved-the stocks have tanked #-our farmers are on welfare and you are losing all our allies! YOU are all Fake News
70 2018-12-25 23:32:14 Dude I just lost 60k in my stocks. Wtf . Worst Xmas eve ever in the stock market ... looks like peanut butter and jelly for lunch
71 2018-12-25 23:32:05 It is TRUMP not the Federal Reserve that’s causing the downturn in stocks. #TrumpLiar #TrumpResign
72 2018-12-25 23:31:14 I won't vote for anyone who's votes have consistently supported power to the corporations vs power to the people 

Since the 2008 crash companies & stocks recovered but 70% of Americans still live paycheck to paycheck 
Obama failed won't vote for him again
73 2018-12-25 23:31:12 My stocks are tanking dude
74 2018-12-25 23:30:53 Wall St. stocks/mutual funds, multi-millionaire taking Social Security payments, 3 houses owned by the guy who's supposed to be the salt of the earth?
75 2018-12-25 23:30:27 Tomorrow will likely see a deeper boxing day special in stocks $SPY $QQQ $DIA
76 2018-12-25 23:30:24 Stocks tanking. Government shutdown. Employees not getting paid. 
It's freaking wonderful
77 2018-12-25 23:29:50 Xmas brought all the $OSTK #bagholders a failed #GSR deal !   #overstock.com #overstock #stocksnottowatch #stocks
78 2018-12-25 23:29:37 yall designers too funny yall aint shit but sum film burns, tumblr stocks, and blackletter font like stfu about how you are good dont forget throw on some noise textures lol
79 2018-12-25 23:27:43 OMG, this weirdo is a Serial Liar.

Investors in FAANG stocks alone have lost Several Hundred Billion Dollars in the last three months, children are dying in ICE/Border Patrol custody, trade talks are a mess, ISIS is still strong, etc. and this pathological liar says all is well.
80 2018-12-25 23:27:37 I'm weary about opening a hands off stocks and shares isa because of what the stock market is about to do
81 2018-12-25 23:27:34 A few stocks to put on high alert going into tomorrow are $WDBG $NOUV $SGCP $PACV $KATX. Some of these (if not all) will run 500%+ in the coming weeks
82 2018-12-25 23:27:07 Stocks dropped since the Dems took the house
83 2018-12-25 23:26:44 There’s millions of unemployed people day trading stocks and they are all panic selling cause they don’t have anything to fall back on. These losers  stock flipping careers were created by the feds 0 rate policies and they are helping to drive this market into the gutter.
84 2018-12-25 23:26:31 Consider it a sale and buy stocks at a discount.
85 2018-12-25 23:26:14 No, our country is not doing well. Look at the stocks!!  Geez!!
86 2018-12-25 23:25:39 Then why is my stocks and IRA in the negative zone? Was about +18% in stocks, now -15%! Just who is running the markets? Is the Fed, Obama's flunkies?
87 2018-12-25 23:24:56 How are the stocks donnie?
88 2018-12-25 23:24:51 Easy to say when ppl have lost jobs Tariffs killing our  farm! Big Boys like you manipulating currency and oil. DAMM YOU TO HELL!
Children in cages dying?
Even on Xmas you LIE!
Well good luck #maga your next, factories closing and stocks tanking Thx Don the Con!
89 2018-12-25 23:24:15 Yeah I know my stocks have lost a lot of value. Buy and hold but sheesh
90 2018-12-25 23:24:01 he clarified that he means people who play 2 stocks or <6 minutes
91 2018-12-25 23:23:47 tu mfais penser à un gars de la vidéo de la mezzanine jerois ds les stocks
92 2018-12-25 23:22:55 The kids table this year wasn’t as fun because half the “kids” are in college so they just talked about stocks, capitalism and bitcoin
93 2018-12-25 23:22:49 I'm loving the stocks Christmas dump though. Great fun!
94 2018-12-25 23:22:42 It seems to feel that way and logic in optionland. Gamma.
Many traders, were fed the logic to hold stocks and hedge with $SPX puts.
When mkt turns, $SPX puts hot potato, unwound first, which is other side of coin of buying index. Those index buyers are not price sensitive.
95 2018-12-25 23:22:40 Well at least the stock market is doing well. Ohhhh wait.... Stocks are on track for the worst year in a decade.
96 2018-12-25 23:22:28 Take a third of it and invest in good stocks put the rest in savings because its better to save the money when you need it
97 2018-12-25 23:21:41 Stocks don’t go up every day, every month or every year. We are in a turbulent market, hold on and have cash ready to deploy is all  you can do.
98 2018-12-25 23:20:10 How are those stocks doing after your rallying phone calls?
99 2018-12-25 23:19:58 PS: Whoever made your charts is clueless. QE is not based on stock prices. It’s based on staving off deflation.

Stocks took a boost this time was b/c Congress slashed the budget.  The Fed couldn’t buy as many T-bills as they wanted to. Meaning excess $ went into debt markets.
100 2018-12-25 23:19:11 @purplemaven007 my stocks. I guess. The outflows must go somewhere. This is a good place IMHO
101 2018-12-25 23:19:09 HE STILL HAS 2 MORE STOCKS
102 2018-12-25 23:19:09 #stocks, S&P's hit extreme #prices at 2900's as written Feb 11, from 2600' to 2900's severely #overbought, only 1 direction from extreme, Down, Wrong to bear #market, wrong forecasts to #banks, prognosticators, commentators. #StockMarket #indices #trends #volatility #
103 2018-12-25 23:17:48 When you take some names like JNCE or other ones, even in different sectors. Where exactly does the market want to take these stocks to? A lot of stocks are way way ahead of a mega crash. Even the darkest 08/09 days.
104 2018-12-25 23:17:17 "Sir. I have ensured your stocks of panta are plentiful. I ordered 8 boxes and they have been delivered to the warehouse nearby. Owned by us of course." 

The male still had his usual stoic look on his face as he spoke.
105 2018-12-25 23:17:01 What other stocks do you like for 2019?
106 2018-12-25 23:16:46 They won't ring a bell for you to buy stocks. You have to put a bag over your head to buy BTC. Maybe time for post Christmas shopping.
107 2018-12-25 23:15:36 I don't own a bump stock and think they are just silly range toys but I agree that if we allow bump stocks to be banned we've set precedence. It'll only be a matter of time before they come for everything.
108 2018-12-25 23:14:22 I remember I got kinda tilted when some one had 3 stocks, 7 minutes on battle field... and then pokeballs started dropping.
109 2018-12-25 23:13:12 Yeah most retired middle class Americans invest their retirement fund into a particular stock to hopefully get some kind of larger income. Rich people invest into a large sum of stocks and don’t feel a few stocks crashing hard at all. Not even accounting for their other assets.
110 2018-12-25 23:12:24 The Fed is screwing with the stocks. We're departing 2 wars that we shouldn't have been involved in and bringing our men and women home. 2 children died bc their parents put them in a dangerous situation.
Have a great night and Merry Christmas .

And there are more Odds.

You habe been warned
112 2018-12-25 23:06:47 Has Mr. Mnuchin been commanded to manipulate the stock market upward? What, is he to spend the black budget on American only stocks!  Good idea????? Legal or anything????? King Midas available to be new Treasury Secretary?
113 2018-12-25 23:06:42 We had the 'Fed Put' for decades but it's not saving markets this time. Now @realDonaldTrump is telling people to #BuyTheDip.  Is this the birth of the 'Presidential Put'? Markets have really become so detached from reality... #Stocks
114 2018-12-25 23:06:29 0. Hedge fund hotel stocks that had been big winners through H1 got ahead of themselves as they came up on the anniversary of last yr’s optimism and tax cut stimulus with everyone looking to Q4 guidance
115 2018-12-25 23:06:24 FED did not force to buy stocks, bonds offered yield in USA.

So all the complaining of stock bubbles is empty.

Rather FED did offer cheap money to earn well.
116 2018-12-25 23:06:01 I am genuinely baffled that not one headline I read, not even the Dumb Orange guy's tweets, mentioned that stocks are hit because a split Congress means all GOP policy is DOA.

I guess 45 doesn't want to draw more attention to the fact he's done.
Maybe even jail.
117 2018-12-25 23:05:51 Ill start buying if they announce the next round of QE, if not the no more stocks for long time
118 2018-12-25 23:05:40 #AAPL #AMZN #C #JPM Watch out for Citi and JPM as well on any market bounce back - they have no resistance until these targets:  Citi - 55.87 and JPM - 101.8.  AMZN, AAPL, JPM, and Citi maybe the best bet if at all the stocks bounce back.  Good luck friends.
119 2018-12-25 23:05:30 People better fuckin' stop doing these 3 minutes and 2-3 stocks rules

121 2018-12-25 23:05:12 Jokes on you, the rich make money when the market is up and when the market is down, because they can afford to buy the cheap stocks when prices are low.
122 2018-12-25 23:04:14 Sii.. . Son petrodependientes pero con una eco en usd A estos precios del oil deberán estar con déficit creciendo..ver También vencimientos de deuda .. y stocks de reservas como habra sido la baja..

124 2018-12-25 23:02:57 You don’t need to care.  I cashed out of stocks in early November so I’m enjoying this little correction.   But you should pay attention because it is gonna give you a chance to buy at much cheaper levels.  Good investors can sense when things are getting too heavy and pull out.
125 2018-12-25 23:01:59 if you’re looking for touch screen drawing tablets, I don’t know much about android but Huion stocks a few that are within your price range!

129 2018-12-25 23:00:35 It’s like The Freshman, where Marlon Brando orders his broker to make his stocks go up.
130 2018-12-25 22:58:49 Done buying stupid stuff, start buying stocks! Trying to better my quality of life!
131 2018-12-25 22:58:44 1. If Crypto is dead how come it went up 30% in a week ?
2. Allocating 100% to stocks and bonds is close to gross negligence right now. So go with gold, cryptos and battery metals.
132 2018-12-25 22:56:49 Lush is also having buy one get one tomorrow until stocks last!
133 2018-12-25 22:56:34 Unfortunately, no one knows where the bottom is. I think if we didn't hit bottom yet, we are very close to a bottom in some stocks, and with any hint of good news, stocks will rally big.
134 2018-12-25 22:55:31 Trump is coming for your guns. He just banned bump stocks
135 2018-12-25 22:54:39 High stocks!
136 2018-12-25 22:54:18 How is that a "present to all of us"? Do you have a 401k, IRA, Mutual Fund , ETF, or individual stocks yourself? That drop hurt most people in the short term, hopefully   it's a "buying opp.". If trump could take credit for the up market, he needs to take credit for the downturn.
137 2018-12-25 22:53:28 Ooh. I've got a mix of stocks and bonds but neither are doing particularly well.
138 2018-12-25 22:52:02 I do have a list of good stocks that went down with the market, because they might go a little lower, I buy the stock and sell calls. Some stocks I sell weekly calls for a quick gain. The Dow dropped 5,159 points between Oct 3rd and Dec 24th. That's a huge drop.
139 2018-12-25 22:51:44 My parents never invested in stocks, so I try to help others do so. If you have any questions, feel free to dm.
140 2018-12-25 22:51:33 Stocks be looooooow
But my pipi B hiiiiiiigh
141 2018-12-25 22:50:45 Well if Hillary would have won the election, stocks would be no where near where they are even today so don’t know why everyone is getting so worked up.   I mean really...people are so dumb, like the stock market is gonna go up 20-25% every year!   Geez....
142 2018-12-25 22:49:48 How do you feel about that bear market? Gonna load up on stocks?
143 2018-12-25 22:49:44 If they feel that way about stocks how do they feel about the state lotteries?
144 2018-12-25 22:49:33 The stock market??? Did you get those stats from KellyAnn? This was the stock market yesterday...
"Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market."
145 2018-12-25 22:49:11 so is leafy gonna quit investing in stocks and come back too? lmao
146 2018-12-25 22:48:43 Is it too late to get in on rake stocks?... #DasKapital

149 2018-12-25 22:47:21 That was due to the federal reserve retaliating against Trump. Take it up with them. Bet ya didn’t have stocks anyway.
150 2018-12-25 22:47:12 Ok chacune a son post et on surveille mes stocks !!!!
151 2018-12-25 22:46:58 .@realDonaldTrump apparently doesn't realize that each time he shouts "the fed is increasing interest rates too quickly" he motivates investors to sell (not buy) stocks thus putting us into a tailspin. Blaming others comes back to bite us all.
152 2018-12-25 22:46:30 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 16% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 2% Positive. Stocks: $AVL was 16% Positive, with $SPX -3% Negative. #ASX

155 2018-12-25 22:45:26 The arrogant phrase "but then you know that". And I have said that the CFP has been a contributor to the decline of fish stocks which had we of been managing them would have managed them better BTW The EU hasn't existed for 40 years, but then you know that 
156 2018-12-25 22:45:12 Yesterday's top 10's: $SPX, $DOW, $ABX, $PLS, $LIT, $BAL, $AVZ, $FMS, $NAG, $ORE, and #ELLIOTTWAVE, #TRADING, #GOLD, #AUSBIZ, #LITHIUM, #STOCKS, #TNRGOLD, #MARKET, #MINING, #COMMODITIES
157 2018-12-25 22:43:37 Because 90 percent of people aren't qualified to pick individual stocks or are too lazy to figure out which is best. Its like suggesting you buy a toyota when i buy a lambo. If you don't want the lambo enough to buy it regardless...you should buy a toyota.
158 2018-12-25 22:43:30 Guide to investing:

* Mario Kart w/ daughter = cash

* Bicycling around town = bonds

* Tandem biking with daughter = stocks

* Going fast down hills with daughter = 2x leveraged stocks

* Going fast downhill w/ daughter standing up riding over banana peel = 3x leverages stocks
159 2018-12-25 22:43:21 The only thing i got for christmas is a notifications from my stocks telling me how much money i lost
160 2018-12-25 22:43:05 You can buy stocks directly without management fees.
161 2018-12-25 22:42:50 IMO, looking at fundamentals on individual stocks without looking at macro economics is equivalent to buying altcoins last year at the highs cause of the "technology". Legacy markets are all correlated, controlled by central banks and subject to market debt cycles.
162 2018-12-25 22:39:56 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
163 2018-12-25 22:38:08 missed my vote, but i say 2200, the levered loan and high yeild bond market looks really bad, and unlike stocks, these etfs could potentially go to 0 or close to it as outflows intesify and approved participants cant arbitrage with the funds
164 2018-12-25 22:37:22 His average supporter don't own stocks. They actually don't even know what that is or how the stock market works...
165 2018-12-25 22:37:19 A good amount of their money is in the market.  I'm sure they have a dollar figure in their head, where they will sell off all stocks.  They were gaining every year since 2008 until this last year.  Then this year they lost the gains from this year and even some of last year's.
166 2018-12-25 22:36:43 The alleged progressives are CLEARLY after more than background checks and bump stocks. They refuse to acknowledge the facts. We need to start openly discussing what us supporters of the 2nd Amendment will do when the left tries to outlaw our guns in order to prevent it.
167 2018-12-25 22:35:52 Their stocks looks worse than our shitcoins 
168 2018-12-25 22:34:47 I'd rather be on big blue FFA 2:30 all items on than 2 stocks 5:00 cause at least the former knows what they want
169 2018-12-25 22:34:07 The main thing is that self promoter Trump keeps all the attention firmly on him. Every stupid tweet for whatever reason is serving that purpose and people are suffering for it. Stocks are tanking and he's leading the economy down the path of ruin. #stoptweetingasshole
170 2018-12-25 22:33:48 Let’s learn stocks together
171 2018-12-25 22:32:57 My stocks, as well as yours went up when he became president.
172 2018-12-25 22:32:34 I'm currently antsy as hell because I wanna go and get the kits for my next project (which is a secret ) but I don't wanna bail on my Dad. Hopefully stocks on what I need last until tomorrow.
173 2018-12-25 22:32:02 Making American stocks cheap again.
174 2018-12-25 22:30:20 Il faudra jouer des ranges partout ce qui sera le plus difficile, dans ce contexte habituellement on délaisse les valeurs de croissance au profit des value stocks.. Ce plan est tjrs celui que je privilégie. Tu sais ou chercher !
175 2018-12-25 22:30:02 #Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. #forex #stocks
176 2018-12-25 22:29:52 Lot of uncertainty, but there's also a place at which stocks make sense even with that. That takes more work than a chart tho imho.
177 2018-12-25 22:29:36 There are compression socks but no depression socks? Depression stocks (sock) could be one giant sock that fits your whole body and feels like a great big hug... plus it's a great place to hide when you don't want to people. #giftidea #depressionsocks #socks #socksforchristmas
178 2018-12-25 22:28:33 invest in the stocks
179 2018-12-25 22:28:04 I don't disagree with you. This is why it is silly for Trump to use it as his personal economic scorecard. He clearly doesn't understand that the Fed is not trying to affect the stock market. Their move is about liquid in the financial/banking sectors. It's loans not stocks.
180 2018-12-25 22:27:47 Stocks are on sale !!!
181 2018-12-25 22:27:14 Stocks across the board the past month have been shitting the bed.
182 2018-12-25 22:27:06 Of course, why I rted it. That guy has “political cred” but it was a preposterous take. 2008 was of course way more than stocks
183 2018-12-25 22:27:04 BTW 100% of stocks will be ours after Brexit
184 2018-12-25 22:26:48 Sorry pal, lost a bundle in the dotcom blowup -- holding blue chip stocks like LU and CSCO. Bought on the way down at -20%. It went down to -50% and stayed down for 10 yrs. So... #I'llWait
185 2018-12-25 22:26:34 Did you get lots of books and clothes? chocolates too in the stocks
186 2018-12-25 22:25:28 Stocks tend to slump after rate spikes, & stocks are getting competition from boring bonds.

Investors get a decent return from an ultra-safe government bond.  Expensive  tech stocks look like a gamble. Facebook, Netflix, and Twitter all fell sharply on Wednesday.
187 2018-12-25 22:24:56 Hit them with the stats from your recent tweet about the percentage losses from highs of prominent stocks.
188 2018-12-25 22:24:33 I'd mention that if the history of tech stocks have taught us anything, it's 1) investors should not make the mistake of underestimating or relegating new tech sectors to "fads".  2) although new tech requires effort to understand, it is more than worth it in the long run.
189 2018-12-25 22:23:41 I have stocks and historically, they go up and down. That is nothing new.
190 2018-12-25 22:22:19 it led to at one point a massive depletion in cod stocks
191 2018-12-25 22:22:06 Watch your stocks and 401 plunge.
192 2018-12-25 22:21:50 No facts, until after the fact. My only contention is to assume prior markets dictate direction has proven a false siren song in stocks and likely too will prove a false siren song in #bitcoin. This market is not the same as 2013-2017. New developments, bigger, more players.
193 2018-12-25 22:21:31 Yup, the smoke clears when’s we’re at ATH + 25%. Then the average rube’s FOMO kicks in full gear. Thus stocks get bid to 15x sales followed by market tanking and said stocks get chopped by 60%. Rube loses shirt. They sell to cash to wait for "smoke to clear". Rinse / repeat
194 2018-12-25 22:21:16 et macron baisse leur budget ils en sont à acheter leur équipement avant de partir en opex tellement les stocks sont vides
195 2018-12-25 22:20:40 My future looks like businesses, stocks, and real estate.
196 2018-12-25 22:19:56 Apols for implying you should take petrol/antifreeze. My local petrol station stocks Blossom Hill, the mightiest of wine brands
197 2018-12-25 22:19:00 I kinda get your point now, thanks!

What do your internal analysis consist of? Reverse engineering changes to see where the economy is headed? (Like flagship stocks, defensive sectors, filter out dead cat bounces etc.)
198 2018-12-25 22:18:37 Sheik can win neutral 5 times and get down 2 stocks before she takes one stock. I don’t even think Bayo is this tragic.
199 2018-12-25 22:15:33 Stock up while stocks last 
200 2018-12-25 22:15:19 All I want for Christmas is my pot stocks to stop declining :/
201 2018-12-25 22:15:10 When have President of USA telling people now good time buy stocks, know it’s all gone to hell in a hand basket..

Uncertainty now global & doesn’t bode well for financial markets in all asset classes..

To suggest entire rigged market could unravel is...

#Trump #markets #fed
202 2018-12-25 22:14:52 I promise you if we continue to break hard in stocks the Fed will do a 180. This is a guarantee. Now how much it has to drop. I have no idea. But the fed has resolve until they feel the pressure of the markets.  It will become unbearable at some point they will claim they must.
203 2018-12-25 22:13:21 Hahahha guys wall street is also backing out of the stocks but they arent talking about that ofcourse i mean a drop of over 16% proofs that they are leaving otherwise it wouldnt go down right? Well thats the argument they use for crypto so it works there aswell ofcourse
204 2018-12-25 22:12:26 red wedding in the stocks app
205 2018-12-25 22:12:05 Don’t worry I’m not gonna trade (stocks, or other assets like ie @chigrl does). My interest is always in how systems work. Small systems, big systems, small systems within big systems, economics, society, the universe, etc. Hence I like to know more about trading.
206 2018-12-25 22:11:56 Stocks started dipping after the Demonrats won back the House. More money for government, less for private investment.
We got used to a Sharia Compliant Fed under Hussein that kept interest rates near zero. What was the economy like over those 8 years? Seniors with savings> glad
207 2018-12-25 22:11:18 It's funny how the crypto market has helped a beginner trader like me accelerate my learning curve. From Penny stocks, to Binary options to Crypto's, the constant practice and watching the charts has helped me understand this industry alot! #Education
208 2018-12-25 22:11:14 Nikkei down a cool 5% on Christmas. Thats over 1000 points. For you clowns blaming DC or the Fed for your losses in US stocks, look elsewhere around the globe. It’s not a US thing. It’s a stocks thing.
209 2018-12-25 22:10:46 Nice deflection. Go get the bump stocks.
210 2018-12-25 22:09:24 It's time to buy low stocks and invest/secure your wealth in gold and silver, bubbles are about to burst.a massive wealth transfer is about to happen.  Imagine 1250 oz of gold cost 15000 to 25000 an oz, silver goes from 14 usd an oz to 400usd an oz....... yes it will happen
211 2018-12-25 22:07:54 Trump bans bump stocks, Trump pulls troops out of the Middle East, and Mattis resigns. Uh oh, we might be in trouble.

213 2018-12-25 22:06:44 #StockMarket  S&P's, a 20% correction? Wrong, more like 10% at best. 20% assumes every #traded price is correct and in #markets, gazillions of #traded #prices are not correct.

214 2018-12-25 22:05:49 Riiiight... all those govt workers should just go and buy stocks.

218 2018-12-25 22:02:52 @BillKristol Nov. Election, Dismal Stocks, & other issues are discouraging but conservative Americans still believe & promote the same things. It's not TRUMP we prioritize as much as reforms that Leftists do not want! We need effective support, not you.
219 2018-12-25 22:02:14 Stocks are behaving wildly. The fun begins when this spills into credit markets.
220 2018-12-25 22:02:00 hi twitter i'm dallas and i love business news and the stock market. i prefer bottom-up investing. large-cap food stocks are my favorite because they're defensive in downturns (and yummy). i focus on the fundamentals in order to make prudent capital allocation decisions.
221 2018-12-25 22:00:02 Here is a tip. The market can go to 0. And, we has a nation will be fine. Most people are not even invested in the stocks. Its a slushfund of their money. I can't wait until its all halted and frozen.  Merry Jesus Day
222 2018-12-25 21:59:53 I forget: When markets plummet, which is it?

C_Panic, but don't pay attention.
D_Convert stocks and bonds to Krugerrands.
223 2018-12-25 21:59:52 Me to my parents: you guys look at your stocks yesterday? LOL
224 2018-12-25 21:58:58 To be honest most methods work. The real keys are 1. develope buy, sell and hold rules, and never break them.  2. Never trust news, but be aware how it effects your stocks. 3. Never invest. Buy with intent to sell.
225 2018-12-25 21:56:33 @Twitter should stop blocking conservative speech. All conservatives will end up selling their Twitter stocks which are not doing too well now anyway. This harassment of conservatives must stop. There is no "danger" in a site where donations for the wall are collected.
226 2018-12-25 21:56:24 @Joe_HAWA1 if u own S&P stocks what would u do , keep them or stop ur loss,
Awaiting ur opinion,thanks
227 2018-12-25 21:55:44 oh oh... The President is "begging" people to make his stocks go up..  -75 $SPX tomorrow..
228 2018-12-25 21:53:01 Ganon's is that they programmed him to not have Ganonside give him the win if the stocks are even to prevent him fishing for it.

The meteor change was done to make edge guards more potent as getting hit by a meteor is made to end the stock earlier than if you just fell
229 2018-12-25 21:49:20 Does anyone know where to find reviews or comparisons to @StocksToTrade
230 2018-12-25 21:46:47 Correct. They/we do not hold stocks. No opportunity for them/us to recover when markets rebound. A guaranteed one way street/road to impoverishment.

237 2018-12-25 21:35:32 Their stocks are on clearance atm.
238 2018-12-25 21:34:42 We lean toward cash generative, high roe businesses with good growth rates and low multiples. Some of the FAANG stocks now fit the bill...
239 2018-12-25 21:33:25 Stocks are down 
240 2018-12-25 21:33:09 J'ai tellement de photos en stocks Han
241 2018-12-25 21:31:44 Yeah, see what happens when the Dems win majority. Ever since November elections, Dems won control of the house, people are petrified and pulling their money out. Trump wins, stocks surge, Dems win house, people got scared. This is all on the left, 100%
242 2018-12-25 21:31:35 Comments with what stocks are attractive? I sitting here thinking what fundamentals look attractive?? No brainer IMO on what will be back leading rally’s if we see them.
243 2018-12-25 21:31:16 The Washington Post: "December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931." The Trump economy is the Titanic headed for an iceberg. Brace yourselves and your 401ks. @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @11thHour @ABC
244 2018-12-25 21:30:30 How dare you- you shut down the government- stocks are dropping like a bomb- taxpayers are on the hook for your shut down-kids are still in cages - how is their Christmas?- Federal employees are not getting paid and you DARE wish us a merry Christmas?
245 2018-12-25 21:29:25 Heck, my gold stocks are killing it!  Thank you Mr. President!
246 2018-12-25 21:28:59 I'll take stocks
247 2018-12-25 21:28:18 Fake news. The stocks falling, are caused by the fed, messing with the rates. Trump is just calling them out on it
248 2018-12-25 21:26:26 On a cruise and a dr from Arkansas asked his wife to check their stocks.His response after hearing how low they were going “I knew when the Dems won the stock market would crash. F the Democrats” Still shocked that this still shocks me.Prob has Fox News on in his waiting room 
249 2018-12-25 21:26:01 Stocks have been going down since the Democrats took the house.  Hmmm.
250 2018-12-25 21:25:32 My mom is upset that they raised the interest rates on stocks 3 times during the Trump administration and NONE during Obama’s administration. Merry cristmas
251 2018-12-25 21:24:06 If you had $10,000.

Would you invest

Crypto - Long term hold

Stocks - short term

255 2018-12-25 21:21:47 Is this all a ruse!, cover up the fact they don’t hold all the XRP as the accounts have purchased! Stocks and shares are the same, gold silver etc it’s all the same! you and 10 others own the same XRP they just hope we don’t ask for it same time! All Brokerages do the same!

257 2018-12-25 21:20:38 Wait closer to end of Q1. FY18 may surprise to the up side, giving upwards momentum to the stocks

259 2018-12-25 21:19:39 and we're buying stocks with 50% of your salary until futher notice because stocks are a steal
260 2018-12-25 21:17:49 There is nothing less relatable than listening to adults talk about stocks.
261 2018-12-25 21:17:46 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
262 2018-12-25 21:15:29 As of now, “this is going to be the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008. The Dow is up 18% under Trump, compared with 45% at this point under Obama. The Dow and S&P 500 are expected to notch their worst December performances since 1931.“ Obama better than you every dept.
263 2018-12-25 21:14:55 Serious question: since crypto is highly risky class, do you expect correlation with stocks? 
Stocks go down->crypto dives->more ramen=necc
264 2018-12-25 21:12:25 I know zero
about stocks ( I’m a hardworking RN  with a 401k) ;however, I do know BS! I think the point of the original post was Trump & Co. want to take credit for the sunshine but no responsibilities for the clouds/rain. Also, Magas are running out of But...

266 2018-12-25 21:09:47 well when the economy does an abrupt cannonball into the Atlantic, anything tied to stocks whatsoever gets wet. its ultimately a pothole though and your not near retirement yet, it'll come back :)
267 2018-12-25 21:09:08 Ah ! Scoop : les milliardaires ne consomment plus !
Que font-ils donc de leur vie ? Des stocks d’or, comme Picsou ?
S’ils sont milliardaires c’est parce qu’ils investissent et dépenses en fonctionnement.
Tout est bon pour soutenir un raisonnement faux !
268 2018-12-25 21:08:23 Are you complaining about low unemployment or great GDP? When stocks go back up, r u going to say what?
269 2018-12-25 21:08:12 I heard "war is over" so many times and in so many covers, I wished it wasn't. 
After this year, even Lennon would vote Yes on bump stocks
270 2018-12-25 21:07:30 @realDonaldTrump Buy more stocks? With what money? I’m losing everything too.
271 2018-12-25 21:06:36 Can you imagine an unhinged government official not thinking his phone calls to important banks would not disrupt the market?.  
Unless the big picture is for a bigger slide so the grifters soon can buy back their tons of shorted stocks and make further billions.  Yes. That’s it.
272 2018-12-25 21:06:36 @realDonaldTrump - The Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago.

273 2018-12-25 21:06:05 I’m hoping someone is purchasing stocks right now. It’ll rebound. 

Yours will absolutely rebound then I’m making you buy me a beer. 
274 2018-12-25 21:03:06 I'll bet you don't have 10 cents worth of stocks.
275 2018-12-25 21:02:35 How can one be bullish on equities when cyclical stocks like this one are acting in such fashion, with oil falling off a cliff no less!
276 2018-12-25 21:02:16 I know it's just funny that he has a million kill moves yet we're all still struggling to take stocks lmao
277 2018-12-25 21:00:08 Feds raised numbers after Trump raised stocks so no it was credit of President Trump not the Fed.
278 2018-12-25 20:56:55 Tanks my stocks?? I guess you haven't seen my numbers or more likely, you pulled that out of your ass
279 2018-12-25 20:56:24 Same down in Port Richmond for Stocks!
280 2018-12-25 20:56:11 3,872 straight up lies from donnie. Caging children and possibly selling them. Stocks in decline. EPA in ruins. Science denial. Treason in Helsinki. Mogilevich owns donnie. Tax scam. Just to name a few.
281 2018-12-25 20:55:15 The unemployment rate going up, inflation accelerating, stocks going down
282 2018-12-25 20:55:14 Yesss, it’s so great. i’ve been doing stocks since last october and have almost over $3,000

286 2018-12-25 20:52:40 Lol how are your big board stocks doing bro
287 2018-12-25 20:51:40 Valuations are cheap I heard, perhaps i don’t know! Stocks are one sale yeah but after the sale always comes the ,,fire sale clearance’’ When Everything must go ..
288 2018-12-25 20:51:31 There is only one asset to buy that is #Bitcoin every thing else is garbage. This game is about money not Stocks. You guys just haven't done your work yet. BUT you SHALL! Buy #Bitcoin it will be the biggest bull of the last 200 years!
289 2018-12-25 20:49:46 We also held Obama responsible for tripling the stock market. Under Trump, stocks are tanking and we’ve had the worst December since the Great Depression. How is your 401(k) doing?
290 2018-12-25 20:48:49 So stocks go up a point?
291 2018-12-25 20:47:07 Clowns never laugh before beans stocks never grew
292 2018-12-25 20:44:43 No.

1 The Puts would be -100 delta (in stocks) or -1 delta in futures
2 The Deep ITM puts would be like Shorting the underlying directly
3. One dollar move in underlying, one dollar move in Deep ITM options
4 Plus at infinity Vol, Vega is infinity, the Puts would worth infinity

296 2018-12-25 20:42:25 They're exactly the sorts I'd put in the stocks if I had my way & brought them back to revive town centres.  Praps u & your daughter could imagine putting them in the stocks & throwing tennis balls at them?
297 2018-12-25 20:41:56 Isn’t the reason the stocks are crashing because the rich people are pulling their money out to protect it while the below middle class can’t because the system locks them in?
298 2018-12-25 20:40:29 There is way more capital than there are opportunities. I don’t believe history will be kind to those stewards of our economy who piled billions of dollars from QE into social media stocks
299 2018-12-25 20:38:27 Je prépare des stocks ! ^^
300 2018-12-25 20:38:16 ya van como 4 samus con 3 minutos de tiempo y 2 stocks campeando LUL

303 2018-12-25 20:33:42 My mom just told me I had a college fund but they lost it because they bought stocks in Mexico and lost it so there’s that 
304 2018-12-25 20:32:13 Who knows anymore. Worst Christmas eve ever for stocks so new territory here.
305 2018-12-25 20:31:11 Checking your stocks when markets are closed?
306 2018-12-25 20:30:49 3 stocks are temporary. Gundam is forever
307 2018-12-25 20:30:43 2000-2002 most IT stocks fell several hundred per cent
308 2018-12-25 20:30:03 Stocks are up
Republicans: economy is great, look at what we did!

Stocks fall
Republicans: the stock market actually doesn't indicate how the economy is doing.

Trump attacks people
Republicans: get thicker skin

Dems criticise Republicans
Republicans: you're all so hateful!
309 2018-12-25 20:30:01 Remember the important thing  on this very special day is the DOW Was 19700 at the end of 2016 and today it is roughly 21700. Dow up by 10% since Trump came to office. Say thank you dumbocrats! Buy stocks now you dummies cuz stocks R going to go straight up a few zigs aside!
310 2018-12-25 20:29:17 Tokyo stocks plunge in Christmas rout amid fears over US economy
311 2018-12-25 20:27:00 Oh yeah, economy is doing great? Let's see the data. You're right, the stocks don't mean anything. We've had a stagnant economy for years.
312 2018-12-25 20:26:48 I need to look at what Apple stocks look like during the holidays
313 2018-12-25 20:26:34 Si soy el dedede, cuando acabas la partida le das a la x o a la y no me acuerdo cuando te enseñan los stocks y eso
314 2018-12-25 20:26:13 I think the weakness is attributable to oil & financial stocks. Oil got smashed and that pushed l/t bonds yields down, got close to inversion on the yield curve and that demolished financials stocks. They are biggest weight in IWM.
315 2018-12-25 20:25:45 Surtout les stocks de foie gras , dindes , huîtres , bûches , chocolats... à -50% 
316 2018-12-25 20:25:31 I know you understand stocks have intrinsic monetary worth based on a reasonable present value estimate of their future enterprise free cash flows. And when there’s a substantial deviation from that present value, those free cash flows can be taken private, causing price returns.
317 2018-12-25 20:24:51 One thing about a bad economy is that I get to focus on hobbies again instead of using that money on stocks.
318 2018-12-25 20:24:26 @realDonaldTrump Draft Dodger Trump the Chump wanted fed to raise interest rates when Obama was President and stocks were soaring.  Why not now, too, Chump!#Hypocrite#Liar#Crook

320 2018-12-25 20:19:31 Just to take your attention to this;

Value of all stocks reached to 30 T$ where GDP is at 20 T$, a 150% of it. This is all time high for the #US for second time
321 2018-12-25 20:18:37 Can we get some help with the stock market crashing...we are LOOSING ALOT of money that we worked had for Mr. President @realDonaldTrump ....Please check the stocks; Dow J has been in the negative for a while now as well as others....Please HELP.....Merry Christmas
322 2018-12-25 20:18:36 Hey Santa, you screwed up. I asked for my weight to go down and my stocks to go up this year! 
323 2018-12-25 20:18:23 The beaut is that even if you are not lucky enough to find the exact bottom, there were many good entries like double bottom, 200 day cross, etc that could have still got you in to double your money to top. Not to even mention if it gave you the clear to find top stocks...

328 2018-12-25 20:13:45 Gold miners were best performing stocks in 30s, 70s, & 00's, all decades where real return on stocks were awful. Not even debatable whether miners provide systematic diversification to overvalued stock markets.

332 2018-12-25 20:03:51 Trump, said  "it's a disgrace what's going on in the Country", is he finally admitting that he is a Treasonous tool, causing a Government shutdown, stocks plummeting, chaos in America? The lies he tells, he must stop telling them & apologize to all with his chin on the floor!

341 2018-12-25 19:58:58 We have also never seen the stocks go over 20k points so I will take that drop because that’s what happens the stocks go up and down and they’ve been going up the last 2 yearsso it’s good
342 2018-12-25 19:56:51 Trump doesn't own any stocks he doesn't care
343 2018-12-25 19:56:07 @SenateGOP @GOPChairwoman @GOP @stevenmnuchin1 Must be fun explaining to your followers that your POTUS doesn't understand economics -- and their 401(k)s and stocks are tanking.  I'm happy to sacrifice mine if it means Trump leaves office. #NoWall

347 2018-12-25 19:55:46 It would be cheerful if stocks actually went up. Make the snowflakes cover up my losses, lol.
348 2018-12-25 19:55:34 Wow.  If only Tech stocks would come down a bit I could buy names like Google , Apple et al..
349 2018-12-25 19:55:31 I really wanna know like the ins and outs. Mainly when it comes to stocks and investments because I really don’t know too much about it. So before I make a decision, I’d like to be well informed.
350 2018-12-25 19:55:23 Fear and more importanly fear of missing out.  

If gold manages to rise this time while stocks continue to tumble, so much $ of what little is left in sheeps' accounts - the vast majority of them too stupid or scared to short - will chase the only / few things that are rising.
351 2018-12-25 19:54:48 Saying you should invest in cryptocurrency because if stocks dropping is an astoundingly dumb take.
352 2018-12-25 19:53:34 lmao, some crypto guy has a bot favoriting any mention of stocks.
353 2018-12-25 19:53:17 @WooSchneider U.S. Office of President has been the crash source of United States and World Economies in 2008?Superior King God Renaldo ,s Administration has been the World hero by Rescue of the World Stocks Markets also.
354 2018-12-25 19:52:48 .@realDonaldTrump How much is Putin giving you to trash the U.S.? You can't possibly think you are making her better! Stocks are horrible, many, even middle class, have lost money due to you. Get out of our W.H.
355 2018-12-25 19:52:35 I hope I don’t grow up to be that guy who talks about stocks on Christmas

357 2018-12-25 19:52:04 My mama loved her new iPad. My nephew doesn’t know it but he has a trust. I’m doing things different. No more toys. Just stocks and bond. I want him to never have a rainy day like I have experienced
358 2018-12-25 19:51:39 Bump stocks should be banned not out of any sense of them making guns more dangerous. They should be banned because they're stupid mallninja crap.

369 2018-12-25 19:43:15 Tbh I see more engineers in Valley believe that it’s just a temporary downturn and not a market crash/recession and that it might be a good time to join tech giants while their stocks are at a discount. I believe 2019 IPOs will make things clearer.

371 2018-12-25 19:42:30 Stock market crashes are indicative of a consumer tapped out &no more buyers left to buy overvalued paper/stock. All of those old white males and trump believers that came off the sidelines and bought stocks provided liquidity for the “smart money” to sell/put on short positions.
372 2018-12-25 19:41:46 Time for the Fed to short gold again, push it back down so stocks will look more attractive. When you own the printing press you can do whatever you want

Nikkei was down 5% Tuesday!  It dropped 5% in one day....holy cow.  
And the Futures are suggesting a 710 drop on Wednesday. 
It will be interesting. Maybe we can buy stocks at bargain prices like an after-Xmas special..lol

You’re a horrible President...
382 2018-12-25 19:37:16 For any who think the economy will rebound: 

It won't, move funds and sell stocks when the bow of the ship tips up. Keep stocks in Amazon and Apple, and maybe GM cuz of the Buick flood in China. The flood will be ending soon tho.

385 2018-12-25 19:36:35 @realDonaldTrump you’re the best at making the market crash! Merry Christmas asshole! “U.S. stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931 during the Great Depression.”
386 2018-12-25 19:34:58 People will once again and maybe for ever lose confidence in the stock market if it doesnt bounce when the president tells to buy stocks. It would have long term negative consequences.
387 2018-12-25 19:34:14 I just fought this Little Mac that kept spamming f-smashes so I camped him out on the platforms. Didn't wanna rematch him cuz the lag and 3DC Mac spam was annoying... I find him again ANYWAYS and his ruleset is set to 3 mins, 2 stocks on FD as Little Mac. Still won bitch.
388 2018-12-25 19:34:08 No sir shorted the initial spike to green and was back out on drop. Market was all red & dropping.
389 2018-12-25 19:33:21 Trump says when it comes to stocks don't look a gift horse in the mouth,and buy when they cry,sell when they yell.The plunge is a great investor opportunity,but not for those that get in too late.

393 2018-12-25 19:30:28 Stocks revolve around all factors of the government. Including the programs Obama instituted and pushed through with executive orders that cant be just stripped away. Atleast Trumps policies are for military and the people unlike others.
394 2018-12-25 19:29:58 Last question, why do you invest in uranium if you believe #nuclear is so bad. As you say, there will be another melt down soon and if so it will kill all the uranium stocks you are advocating. R u not playing with fire? Normally #uranium investors actually believe in technology.
395 2018-12-25 19:29:39 moved from 25% stocks to 50% but don't think the party is over. Buying prudently. From my experience probably better bargains will appear

397 2018-12-25 19:27:52 Wouldn’t that be a contrarian bet stocks are going up?  High put volume usually are bottoms.
398 2018-12-25 19:27:41 Rising interest rates will cause some to move money from stocks  to interest rate based investments. There 2 factors affecting the recent sell off. Profit taking and the clear eyed assessment that 6 months from now earning will be down. ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN COMING

LOL
405 2018-12-25 19:22:51 How quickly you forget about the best two years this country has ever seen in terms of stocks . your raving about one stinking day have fun because will be breaking records again schmuck
406 2018-12-25 19:21:52 Obama called the bottom in US stocks in March 2009 while doomers like you were screaming for imminent hype-inflation and a second Great Depression
407 2018-12-25 19:20:43 Buy these cheap stocks so that I can become financially independent faster and pay off these student loans
408 2018-12-25 19:20:25 @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul I respectfully request that you scrap the ban on bump stocks and regulate the sale by requiring they be made a "dealer added accessory" which means they will covered by the gun owner's background check on  his gun. I think Sen Schumer sold you...

410 2018-12-25 19:18:14 @realDonaldTrump Trump ruins Christmas. Trump shutdown, huge losses to our 401K, stocks crash, makes us less safe by handing Syria to Iran & Russia, reenergises ISIS by telling the enemy he's leaving Afghanistan, & creates doubt about the spirit of Christmas for a 7 yr old child

412 2018-12-25 19:17:05 Maybe.  But something has to end the insanity of the overvaluation of stocks.  And it's probably also a good reason not to invest our retirements so deeply in Wall Street.
413 2018-12-25 19:16:04 I went from living in a loft to a smaller apt, I went from driving a Beamer to driving a regular car, Made more investments, Learned stocks, Saved up all my money and became smarter
414 2018-12-25 19:15:44 Anybody in here invest in dividend stocks? Hit me up I have questions.
415 2018-12-25 19:15:43 Merry Christmas Shayne hope your having a great day miss you playing for @FifeFlyers
416 2018-12-25 19:15:40 That is just prudent market making. I have deep positions in various Russian stocks... EverBank, gazprom, Alrosa, Inter Rao, and a handful of others... so I follow the Micex closely
417 2018-12-25 19:15:31 Damn right...  then again neither are we - the UK!   I never thought that in 2018 the US & UK would be laughing stocks of the entire world, yet here we are!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
418 2018-12-25 19:14:05 cette grenade est interdite depuis 2014... excuse du gouv " on continue de les utilisé jusqu'a epuisement des stocks"... Si vous avez l'impression vous aussi qu'on se fout de notre gueule car ils remplissent leur stock au fur et a mesure levez la main! ;)
419 2018-12-25 19:13:41 constantly the case. A whole store stocks the game early. Look back at the Smash 4 situation a month before it's release it was all over europe.
420 2018-12-25 19:12:26 Goals for 2019 - Health, Wealth & Family. Work towards getting better at financial investments - crypto, stocks, bonds, etf etc

424 2018-12-25 19:09:56 How are folks who put up with his social policies in return for tax cuts gonna spin this one:

425 2018-12-25 19:09:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
426 2018-12-25 19:08:54 yesterday one of my coworkers who is like in his late 60s or early 70s goes: “jesus christ. I’m sick of this make america great again guy.” because he lost a bunch of money in stocks i was like you tell him
427 2018-12-25 19:07:46 Absolutely true. The longer u stay invested, the better is your temperament and investing thesis. If I liked the stocks I held before this down rally, I should be loving them if nothing fundamentally has changed about the business. $SQ point in case. Merry Christmas to all!
428 2018-12-25 19:06:51 Only rich people have stocks lol duh mike. What it actually is, is only smart people own equity and stupid ppl root against our economy.
429 2018-12-25 19:06:12 How does the dilution work? As of what date are the 2 stocks diluted into each other.,
430 2018-12-25 19:05:08 Merry Christmas Shayne, hope you're having a great day
431 2018-12-25 19:04:51 Si l'année prochaine, on part sur une année ou on doit faire des stocks moi je suis entièrement pour..
432 2018-12-25 19:04:34 Really excited to start the New Year off with the Stocks To Trade. I'm excited and scared but I  won't let that stop me.
433 2018-12-25 19:04:19 Why not? If you're retiring in a year, don't hold stocks, but if you're retiring in 10+ years, stocks positive in Long run
434 2018-12-25 19:03:53 Yeah, as your stocks tank, your SS disappears, your country becomes chaotic and weak, and the entire rest of the world laughs at us, you remember that THAT is what you voted for.
435 2018-12-25 19:03:39 The market was just an excuse. Many of these magats can’t even afford stocks. They deal with trump because he is leading their racist agenda for white supremacy. It has always been about race, and they are running out of excuses for denying it.
436 2018-12-25 19:03:33 Reminder for next year to buy stocks in Lynx just before Christmas
437 2018-12-25 19:02:45 Being able to seal stocks early
438 2018-12-25 19:02:44 Trump urging you to buy stocks now is the inverse of Obama saying “I think stocks may be potentially a good deal right now” at the lowest point in the recession
439 2018-12-25 19:01:27 اجرنا واجركم ان شاءالله 

اللهم امين يارب 

الله بجزاك خير يارب
440 2018-12-25 19:00:25 Maybe they’re shorting stocks.
441 2018-12-25 18:59:59 Is it true that if you play ssbu close to the tv, you get better at it than when from afar you're always the first player to lose all your stocks
442 2018-12-25 18:59:41 Theodora - I think you’ll find this is simply good management- running down stocks of perishables just before closing!
443 2018-12-25 18:58:14 Opinions are subjective. Facts are objective. Fact: many corporations took their tax breaks and bought back stocks. Opinion: I think Trump is a dividing force in this country and I do t want his holiday wishes. See the difference?
444 2018-12-25 18:58:13 But if you know what you're doing and have a fail-safe plan I think its okay to borrow money for stocks.
445 2018-12-25 18:58:11 I believe you should have gone with Melania to Mara Largo and find something to focus on other than the failures of your tenure. Golf and they will tell you your great! Best golfer around! Be in your gated community to keep all those low life middle class folks away! Stocks...Sad
446 2018-12-25 18:58:05 God has NOTHING to do with Trump. So, essentially, you are thanking Putin and the Russians. But just keep deluding yourself while stocks crash, your healthcare and SS disappear, and the country becomes weak & chaotic. Hooray! The libtards don’t like it!
447 2018-12-25 18:57:15 And what stocks might we find in here? Just a guess Google Amazon Netflix Apple Facebook?
448 2018-12-25 18:57:13 Are you serious? It sounds like you're suggesting that the SEC has everything under control. They have SOME restrictions on short selling, but it works with individual stocks for a limited time (and those stocks can be driven way down before the rule kicks in). Not=uptick rule.
449 2018-12-25 18:56:59 Anybody doing a business, stocks, or investors workshop?
450 2018-12-25 18:56:33 When stocks are overvalues, they're going to come down.  There's no teleology involved.
451 2018-12-25 18:56:29 Stocks is a new crypto.
452 2018-12-25 18:55:59 Why would anyone buy this junk?  $MSRT is one of the worst stocks in the cannabis sector! Looks like you must be paid to promote this garbage. @Invest420 @sharesleuth @MJBizDaily @CannaScamAlert #pumpanddump @buhlreports @CannaRegs @cannabist @HIGH_TIMES_Mag @arcviewgroup
453 2018-12-25 18:55:31 
454 2018-12-25 18:54:25 Buy high sell low. Invest in penny stocks
455 2018-12-25 18:54:11 $spx according to fintwit the word will disapear tomorrow... BUY THE FEAR. accumulate ur favourite stocks! Bit a bit.. build position.
456 2018-12-25 18:53:55 For a beginner, stocks over crypto, right?
457 2018-12-25 18:53:51 Correct. Just signed a law restricting bump stocks. Explain how you have less freedom and equality under Trump. Explain how we don’t have freedom of the press when CNN spends 94% of their time trolling Trump?
458 2018-12-25 18:51:01 Or people are *moving money, not *making money. That is, people are merely moving money from risky assets (investments) like stocks to safer investments like real property or even bonds.
459 2018-12-25 18:50:13 Do you think Oil is worth investing in? #investing #stocks
460 2018-12-25 18:49:51 I’m sorry you’re a twitter bully and have to resort to name calling. I’m pretty sure I’m not an idiot and can pick stocks. I’m down from last year at this time. But hey, I’ll ride it out. Oh and it’s all over the internet that the DOW had a horrible day Christmas Eve
461 2018-12-25 18:49:30 The FED raised the rate again and all I’m hearing is stocks stocks and more stocks. What about a man and women that just got married and wants to raise a family. Paydays may have gone up a little but I know in my own case my house payment has gone up $50 a month.
462 2018-12-25 18:47:29 Nifty will underperform in Jan series and we will fall and chances are that we will hit 10000 as most of the stocks have formed an intermediate top . So be Careful
463 2018-12-25 18:46:59 Ah quick play or arena then. Just so you know most people use 3 stocks now instead of 2.
464 2018-12-25 18:46:44 In screener Magic Formula stocks are mostly black magic stocks like 8k miles, Vakrangee etc. Quite impossible to screen good stocks.
465 2018-12-25 18:46:38 I know it might seem shocking, but not all of us who own stocks want the candidates we vote for to unfairly be biased towards our companies.
466 2018-12-25 18:45:20 Trump b4 election:
“If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day"
then
Stock Market had another good day but, now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed, we have tremendous upward potential. 

Trump now:
 It's all the Fed's fault!
467 2018-12-25 18:45:12 Yeah, no shit, that’s how stocks are supposed to work! In fairness, market behavior is WAY more than the President, but if u think this drop doesn’t have something to do with Trump’s “unpredictability” you’re crazy.
468 2018-12-25 18:44:13 Wait so stocks are kinda like lives right?
469 2018-12-25 18:44:00 @HuaweiIndia Can you confirm that the stocks of #HuaweiMate20Pro being sold in croma are free from the #gluegate issue?
470 2018-12-25 18:43:37 apple stocks rise by 69%.
471 2018-12-25 18:42:46 reducing taxes increased the deficit, requiring greater debt issuance at exact time policy eliminated many natural buyers

if they’re buying treasuries, they’re not buying stocks

if there’s a real bogeyman out there, it’s LT treasury yields jumping to 5-6% in a short timeframe
472 2018-12-25 18:42:06 Isn't it, generally, advisable to buy stocks while their price is dropping, assuming you are not selling your house to buy them, of course?
473 2018-12-25 18:41:32 Also warned us about the stock market.. so i sold my stocks 3 monthe ago, before the huge drop, going to use that to buy BTC laddering in between 1360-3060.. thanks!!!
474 2018-12-25 18:41:14 Absolutely! Many of his stocks should’ve been zero, but can’t let that happen to WB.
475 2018-12-25 18:40:57 Typically things like CPC CPCE BPSPX TRIN show conditions, not used as triggers since conditions can become more extended or extreme. Divergence like CPCE TRIN or NYMO higher low at a stocks lower low, usually more directly helpful. Will see... still needs price triggers.

482 2018-12-25 18:36:48 read again. many stocks bought during 2011 or 2013 too. only success stories shared.
483 2018-12-25 18:35:58 Translate to : all my paid for friends at Mara shithole are upset because their stocks are tanking don't want to see them right now BC it is his fault

488 2018-12-25 18:34:42 Hans asks for Joe Takagi “Vice Chairman, Nakatomi Investment Group.”

They didn’t make anything. They managed money (bonds!), real estate, managed all types of “deals”, bought and sold various stocks and bonds. In the 80s, they would have been involved in semi-shady deals.
489 2018-12-25 18:33:44 WELL ... just when I was going to introduce you to @sexy_glass - she stocks some of the BEST wines in town ...

492 2018-12-25 18:32:39 Stocks are crashing what should we do....... 
but more when else will shares be this cheap
493 2018-12-25 18:30:48 And since US and Canada have many of the same stocks, so it goes in Canada too.
494 2018-12-25 18:29:12 What as ass ... yep, all the rich dudes with idle cash can scoop up low valued stocks and get richer. Everyone else - good luck if you’re retiring soon and are relying on that 401(k) ...
495 2018-12-25 18:29:10 Lol..@contrarianEPS  see how these guys are telling many entered above 4k... These guys were apparently buying truckloads after it fell from ATH.   Shouting as if there are no other stocks apart from HEG.
496 2018-12-25 18:29:04 My portfolio was the worst under Obama.  Minimal gains Whrreni have to pull back on aggressive stocks and ride it out.

498 2018-12-25 18:25:55 So should we invest in stocks or not?
499 2018-12-25 18:25:08 I think the stocks are only a precursor for the economy. If we will see (and we will) an economic meltdown, people will need to liquidate assets into cash to pay of bills and debt. This includes crypto. In the longrun, though, we'll see people waking up and hedge into BTC more.
500 2018-12-25 18:24:35 More laws on guns than practically anything else.  Yes more laws will help .   Ban on bump stocks is a joke. So get ahold if yourself.
501 2018-12-25 18:24:00 Care to back this up with any analysis?  please don’t pull up a chart going back to 2008. Would put yield at 15% and no the div is not in danger. You have an agenda and are a bully. you reverse course on so many stocks and your motives are suspect. $F $MU just to name a few.
502 2018-12-25 18:23:31 The deleveraging in stocks started in Q1. I have a hard time believing nat gas spike blew out the s&p and cut 250 billion off AAPL. There’s more to this story that has yet to be revealed.
503 2018-12-25 18:22:21 @VanidaPeters #FederalReserve - insidious, Powell raises rates while reducing liquidity. Stocks tank. Fed Chair should resign.
504 2018-12-25 18:20:44 Not again. The way you can thank the staff is by getting rid of expensive dead wood, find ways of decreasing missed appointments, too many managers on top salaries which they don’t deserve. Order stocks centrally, using the power of mass purchasing.
505 2018-12-25 18:20:23 Hi Jonathan,  I don't trade in stocks; concentrate exclusively on options.  Currently, I am playing banks as the earnings are due in two weeks.  I also bet on stocks with unusual option activity - like insider buying, M&A news, drug approval, etc.  Thanks.

510 2018-12-25 18:15:28 No one holds stocks like they did in the past hint hint
511 2018-12-25 18:15:15 I’m not going to be buying cyclical stocks/highly levered stocks at this point. Stuff like $GOOG, $EQC, etc.
512 2018-12-25 18:13:01 There are folks who are buying, just out numbered by price driving down Indexes. disconnected stocks lift when Market falls. know the market structure before dipping a toe
513 2018-12-25 18:12:47 I wish I had moved a little faster on getting out of stocks, I started to move things before the midterms but not quite quick enough, lost a lot of $.  I knew the Dems would screw it all up.
514 2018-12-25 18:12:19 Never thought would see the day.. Weed stocks!!
515 2018-12-25 18:11:46 Are you winning if the bank holding all you/your clients' money suddenly loses it or goes out of business? 

Betting on stocks without an insider's intelligence? Lol! Come on... that's called a cancerous human condition
516 2018-12-25 18:11:39 Thanks to getting screwed in crypto I cashed out of all my stocks few weeks ago
517 2018-12-25 18:11:29 Average that out and you get Stocks down ~16% and Gold up ~890% over next 10 years.

Pretending you can out stock pick that is hubris.

Unless you’re talking gold stocks.

Cheers & Merry Christmas!
518 2018-12-25 18:11:20 Would you sell stocks if namo doesn’t come back ?
519 2018-12-25 18:10:38 U already better than these 2d “no stocks” designers 
520 2018-12-25 18:09:47 My New Years resolution is to not lose my shit on people who think bump stocks turn a semi-auto into full auto.
521 2018-12-25 18:09:06 Why would you ever buy japanese stocks?
522 2018-12-25 18:07:34 Trump is fighting only 4 himself & Putin. How else do you explain non-payments 2 Veterans, cancellation of Meals-On-Wheels (a program disabled Veterans use), waited over a year 2 finally ban bump stocks, lied & said Mexico wld pay 4 the wall.
He can't work w/anyone!
#TrumpResign
523 2018-12-25 18:06:39 Trump is calling the recent "dip" in the stock market an incredible opportunity, and urging the public to buy.  When the President urges citizens to buy stocks you known there's a problem.  But when he urges citizens to buy Treasuries you'll know the problem has become a crisis!
524 2018-12-25 18:06:35 An economic crisis is a great time for patient investors . Find stocks with great fundamentals available at a major discount and drive in with a truck load of money . Also, this is going to be the biggest recession we see. 50% sale or more on your fav stocks
525 2018-12-25 18:06:34 Because she calls them out in corruption. People in the house and senate should not be able to trade stocks and then make a legislation that makes the money on their stocks. They should have to sell all stocks before they get into office. And I’m totally against any lobbyist ever
526 2018-12-25 18:06:25 thank god for stocks
527 2018-12-25 18:06:09 Sell all of your duty free shop stocks!
528 2018-12-25 18:05:47 You aren’t going to bring stability(at the level you are referring to)in a asset class that is used in countless use cases. It’s completely different than a market like stocks where the asset has no actual utility.What matters is overall growth,not an ath that lasted a short time
529 2018-12-25 18:05:25 Can we look into the presidents selling and buying if stocks with respect to the stock market and his rants in Twitter?

533 2018-12-25 18:03:17 Your GOP President and GOP of both houses the last two years has run the entire country into the ground, and lost us our leadership position among nation's. World leaders laugh openly at your President. He can't even operate and umbrella. Trillion dollar deficit. Stocks tanking.
534 2018-12-25 18:02:04 Stats shows 1.4 year. But for individual Market leader stocks it can be more than 15 years!!!

538 2018-12-25 18:00:58 .. but sadly no bump stocks allowed for them.
539 2018-12-25 18:00:50 What happened to a President that calms the country’s fears when stocks drop and wishes Merry Christmas without insulting people

542 2018-12-25 17:59:53 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, during the great recession. You do remember 2008? I was not affected too much but I had neighbors who lost their jobs and homes, I knew people who had to come back from retirement at 70. It was like so across the country
543 2018-12-25 17:59:43 Got some “why are stocks crashing” questions this holiday. Ready for a bounce soon.
544 2018-12-25 17:59:05 $SPY as far as I know there's no liquidity crisis, just banks wanting to buy stocks cheap, probably even cheaper. $QQQ $IWM $AAPL $MSFT $BA
545 2018-12-25 17:58:50 Luckily your store manager Mohan Reddy of AS Rao nagar understood & got me to prebook again with no assurance of delivery as you have no stocks and allegedly you delivered my older prebook to someone else. My new order is with same email id Kindly ensure it reaches ASAP 2/2
546 2018-12-25 17:57:37 Gotta get some hopium to help lift their favourite stocks?
547 2018-12-25 17:57:13 You just said now is a good time to buy stocks. I want to see your portfolio. You could be doing this to make money for you and your family and rich friends, knowing what you say impacts the market. Don't trust you at all to not line your pockets.
548 2018-12-25 17:55:23 I’m sorry to tell you that the market is adjusting for the incoming Democrats who are going to stall the country for the sake of illegal aliens. Stocks and 401(k)s have done beautifully for two years under Trump
549 2018-12-25 17:53:18 Buy stocks now!
550 2018-12-25 17:53:10 Your hot take is incorrect. Read a book. Over a 40-50 year time horizon, stocks are the only game in town.
551 2018-12-25 17:52:26 Awesome, great sale on stocks then, thank goodness I’m sitting on some cash. Thanks and Merry Christmas, Nostradamus!
552 2018-12-25 17:52:19 Obama said, “What you’re now seeing is profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal, if you’ve got a long-term perspective on it.”     PROFIT & EARNINGS Ratios lol
553 2018-12-25 17:52:10 Stocks down accross the board, 2-3% a day. Federal employees working without pay. Surely it's a happy holiday. I guess it depends who you ask. Those tax breaks really helped corporations buy back stock as fast as their CEOs dump it. Thank goodness I saved $100 on my taxes!!
554 2018-12-25 17:50:45 No bump stocks under the tree this year. I didn’t even get a refund from the nra for selling out.
555 2018-12-25 17:49:16 No natal de 2018 soldados sul e nortecoreanos largaram as armas para disputar uma partida de Smash Bros Ultimate 1-on-1, 3 stocks, Final Destination, no items. Quem disse que era só um jogo?

Retweet se você chorou 
556 2018-12-25 17:48:47 And it’s been rough on those, who on advice of their brokers, waited to take their annual distributions from their IRAs.  Selling stocks at the lowest point of the year to raise the cash.
557 2018-12-25 17:46:46 Not only rich people, many middle class people with regular jobs and modest investments trying to save money for their retirements are losing money. I don't know why people like yourself think that only rich people lose money when stocks tumble.
558 2018-12-25 17:46:36 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
559 2018-12-25 17:46:21 Now that the true state of the economy is being revealed stocks will returned to the levels they were when trump took office. It's not a bad thing though, they'll jump up again! And I make money both ways sooo it's all cool with me lol
560 2018-12-25 17:46:19 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression.
561 2018-12-25 17:46:15 Got more stocks for Christmas, I’m about to be annoying 
562 2018-12-25 17:45:57 Bonjour @KLIMTechs est ce qu'il y aura des nouveaux stocks du klim domination ? Si oui quand svp ?
563 2018-12-25 17:45:50 This post was originally to knock on people who play with 2 stocks and omega stages LMFAOO
564 2018-12-25 17:45:00 2019, #Stocks will tumble and #Crypto will rise and conquer.
565 2018-12-25 17:44:45 Lol you trade stocks and you don't think Trump had anything to do with it? Lmao. I hope you have a day job.  Get a calendar and look what has happened to stocks since Trump was elected.
566 2018-12-25 17:44:41 Nope, not true, and Stocks are in the red this year despite the "big" tax cut
567 2018-12-25 17:43:25 It's true that stocks now are much greater values than just a month ago. But here's a big risk: Heading into 2019 nervous Wall St analysts may start hacking earnings estimates, fearful they're missing warning signs of recession. That would drive price-to-earnings ratios up again.
568 2018-12-25 17:42:46 The fam got me 1,000 bump stocks,,,selling them for 500 a piece so HMU
569 2018-12-25 17:41:30 Anyone who bet long on the dow in a trump presidency was nuts.  Mid cap stocks outperformed the dow even during the exuberance and will still hold.

The record high confidence among manufacturers tells the real story.
570 2018-12-25 17:40:35 Oh no don’t get me wrong, Stocks are the way to go but you need to really invest real money into it to make it worth anything cuz it’s such a long term investment
571 2018-12-25 17:39:25 Correct me if I'm wrong
2018 has been quite interesting for the #stocks #market
The #Dow witnessed the largest intraday point swing as far as I know
The largest daily point losses and 2nd and 3rd largest point drop losses belongs to 2018 as well
The 3rd largest daily point gain
572 2018-12-25 17:39:15 Example of what I mean:

For the last 10 years, your government (I’m Canadian ofc) took tax dollars from every US citizen they could and used that money to bail out and prop up companies. The fraction of US citizens that actually can afford to own stocks saw 200% ROI this decade.
573 2018-12-25 17:39:11 Over the past 2 months, the president has done far more to reduce inequality than Obama ever did. We should give him due credit for tanking stocks.
574 2018-12-25 17:38:22 @MBermaui I'd love to know your price target on Gold, and these gold stocks DRD, GFI, BTG, SAND. Many thanks!
575 2018-12-25 17:37:47 I dunno if it’s worth having one with how unstable the market is. Investing is stocks is gambling, and should be treated as such. The conventional wisdom of investment doesn’t apply in a market that loses like 75% of its value every 10 years. It’s not even about recovery anymore.
576 2018-12-25 17:37:34 @davidmoadel Are there any marijuana company stocks you would suggest to keep your eye on?
577 2018-12-25 17:37:17 Here you go, 3-Month Performance of WB's most important holdings:  AAPL - 33.5%;  BAC - 26.1%; AXP - 18.5%; KHC - 24.7%; USB - 19.6%; WFC - 19.6%; JPM - 21%; Oracle - 16.6%.  I am sure he is buying more now because of attractive dividends that these stocks offer.
578 2018-12-25 17:36:15 Saburo really out here making tons of money off stocks and hacking the dept of defense’s website in 3 hours.... at 14
579 2018-12-25 17:34:49 What stocks have you invested in? I'm interested
580 2018-12-25 17:34:14 Arrest them and if we had stocks/pillories, then the travelling time is all but eliminated. Come back and book them in when you get the time. It gives the suspect time to reflect and the public time to take the piss.
581 2018-12-25 17:33:04 And Stocks in Russian oil companies Gazprom, LukOil & God knows what else.  Our Sec of Defense shouldn’t have investments in foreign adversaries.  THIS administration is corrupt & needs to go. Vote every Republican out before they destroy America.
582 2018-12-25 17:32:12 Just another reason to watch today! RT @MollyLineFNC: I’m hanging with @BlakeBurman today for a #Christmas shift - 1pm to 4pm. We talk politics, partial shutdown, border security, economy, stocks... not a slow news day! And we won’t forget some Christmas cheer!
583 2018-12-25 17:31:36 @VinceMcMahon thank you very much,  for bringing back John Cena,  cuz I know for Sure your ratings wil increase, I do know after you made the announcement that the McMahons will run RAW and SMACKDOWN, YOUR stocks went down 5%,this will help bring them back UP, with John Cena back
584 2018-12-25 17:31:25 I don't know if we are on a strict bear market (for me the 20% drop doesn't determinate if we are on a bear or just a correction) but in bear markets stocks have huge rebounds (of course they get stuffed), I'm trying to play this rebound but man, it has been really hard
585 2018-12-25 17:31:12 Dividends Facts:  Nasdaq Stocks with 5% or more Dividends? KHC - 5.88%, VOD - 9.88%, STX - 6.97%, WDC - 5.7%.  Dow:  XOM - 5.01%, IBM - 5.84%.
586 2018-12-25 17:30:24 Thank you! Blessings to you and your as well.
Happy Holidays
587 2018-12-25 17:29:49 @StocksResearch Beyond certain price downward movement signals a recession which will be bad for India also. Global recession is worse than an oil price which hovers around 75-80$. Stocks will crash so will the growth & GDP
588 2018-12-25 17:29:08 For longer term investing, look for high quality divided paying stocks and mature growth companies. $xom, $t, $aapl, $msft, $cvx, $ko, $pep, $jpm, $wfc, $mmm, $siegy, $ups, $itw, $jci, $dwdp, $ip, $tm, $hmc, $bp, $k, $duk, $so, $aep, $ed, $td, $pru
589 2018-12-25 17:28:37 My viewpoint is more pedestrian. I try to figure who would want to buy this stock now & why? I think the first re-entry will be money managers picking up high quality dividend stocks. You can already put together a pretty nice cash flow. E.g. $SU $CNQ $KEY $IPL $PPL $TRP $IGM etc
590 2018-12-25 17:28:19 Dividends Facts:  Nasdaq Stocks with 5% or more Dividends? KHC - 5.88%, VOD - 9.88%, STX - 6.97%, WDC - 5.7%.
591 2018-12-25 17:27:43 Dividends Facts:  Nasdaq Stocks with 5% or more Dividends? KHC - 5.88%, VOD - 9.88%, STX - 6.97%, WDC - 5.7%.
592 2018-12-25 17:27:04 I forgot to take a picture, but the Wegmans in Frederick, MD now stocks White Lily flour, thanks to you.

You’re making it happen, Amanda!
593 2018-12-25 17:26:29 US stocks had their worst Christmas Eve on record MAGA? #TimeForChange
594 2018-12-25 17:25:55 2things mr d..im concern about our stocks..last is - get the b-wall UP!!!!
595 2018-12-25 17:25:23 People that invest in stocks long term are undefeated. Yet every time we fall for it.
596 2018-12-25 17:24:34 So you're not in a thread bagging on Hogg getting into Harvard?  

Who is the individual responsible for the legislation banning bump stocks?
597 2018-12-25 17:24:25 The bump stock ban is the very top-most tip of the iceberg that is David’s anti-2A platform, you are just a useful idiot helping him achieve it.

Personally I don’t care about bump stocks, but I know that if we settle for nothing now we’ll be forced to settle for nothing later.
598 2018-12-25 17:24:05 They'll just buy more stocks since everything is so cheap. They're rich enough to survive ten market crashes.
599 2018-12-25 17:23:59 My hentai heaven stocks ain’t doing to well 
600 2018-12-25 17:23:18 Cryptos are down about 55 percent just the last month, 92 percent from the Time you told people to jump in. Had there been a 1m investment with ur idea that would be sub 100K now and with stocks like 860k so... What do u expect. Btw I like cryptos. Been profiting all the way down
601 2018-12-25 17:23:15 Notice my tweet said “stocks in my MS classes”. 
We didn’t buy TIF in my classes at Market Scholars, but you are correct that we bought TIF several years ago when I worked for my previous employer. We are still up substantially on that buy, I might add.
602 2018-12-25 17:22:44 I sold some good Stocks and kept some Naughty and sold some real Naughty for tax loss against winners. Merry Christmas 
603 2018-12-25 17:22:41 With all Graphite stocks trading @ 52W low, next support is going to be a real test of bulls. With RSI at 20, we might just save the day. Also, our GE stocks never rose as much as the international players, so ideally the damage should be less. Only time will tell.
604 2018-12-25 17:22:38 Gonna buy some pot stocks real quick.
605 2018-12-25 17:22:21 From where do you get so much of English word stocks? Pros of studying literature?
606 2018-12-25 17:22:04 me and clave ate 50 mozarella stocks in three days so now we have no food and everything is closed this is hell
607 2018-12-25 17:20:53 @csmoneytrade Please increase the navaja knife crimson web(MW) skin stocks. I cannot trade because of this overstock problem for 10 days and I wanted your help for this problem many times before but you didn't. Find a solution.
608 2018-12-25 17:20:26 Stock market crashing is never good for anyone except a few wealthy folks who bet on stocks crashing. Let us not celebrate that simply because it hurts Trump. That is like cutting off your nose to spite your face, as the saying goes.
609 2018-12-25 17:20:24 We all know how Puff-polls work, idiot. It's like pump & dump stocks. You're not fooling anybody. Take your quest for Socialism to some other party. Democrats are not socialists.
610 2018-12-25 17:20:20 Wow ... If I put my money in now, even take a loan on these stocks, its gonna be like the smart investors of 2008 that became millionaires off of it. Those stocks are gonna pay out way more then the loan is worth once the economy is back on track! I love recessions!
611 2018-12-25 17:20:19 Jen tak mimochodem. Již první generace mého finančního modelu po 2 a 1/4 roce fungování ve fondu QUANT drtivě vede nad vlajkovou lodí EAM Top Stocks. V poměru výkon/riziko vede ještě drtivěji.

Druhá generace se testuje, zatím není v běžném provozu. Pracuji na třetí.
612 2018-12-25 17:19:58 Why in the hell doesn’t he just put his money in some blue chip stocks, leave basketball and quit trashing people who want to make money like he does?
613 2018-12-25 17:19:50 During Obama’s Dow is moving up,
R’s: Never confuse the stocks with economy!
During Trump’s the stocks is moving up, R’s: Stock market = Economy!
During Trump’s, the stocks is going down,
R’s: Never confuse the stocks with economy! 
614 2018-12-25 17:19:26 You have to agree with him on this though. It is a disgrace, children in cages, Syria, stocks, GOP, etc.
615 2018-12-25 17:19:01 He didn’t. He made rich people richer which made the stocks look better, but the general population has only gotten worse. The net poverty level has increased. More people than ever are suffering from financial insecurity.
616 2018-12-25 17:18:23 Kkang's buying YG stocks to protect winner before he'll buy that beachfront mansion. Invest in SM too love. They're more stable. Stock trader!kang rise!
617 2018-12-25 17:18:10 BTW, Trump gets paid millions, especially in stocks. He had so much money, he already bought votes for the next election. Stop defending him, he doesn’t defend you.
618 2018-12-25 17:17:55 Merry Christmas Mr.President, to you and your family. We still love you even tho you banned bump stocks.
619 2018-12-25 17:17:45 He should save his money wait until 50,000,000 dollars spend on stocks and be himself
620 2018-12-25 17:17:31 Yeah man, I don't get it. Why are liberals so hung up with the whole "cause and effect" thing? Obama is just as much to blame for Trump's policies hurting stocks as he was before Trump's policies took hold. Dumb demon-craps!
621 2018-12-25 17:16:54 That’s about to get real ugly. It’s crazy to think some of these stocks like $T, $GE, among others haven’t seen an ATH since 2000 & have been setting new lows since.
622 2018-12-25 17:16:40 Can you play the Options both ways as Insurance Michael Lamothe has some great ideas on that subject. You can IM him, tell him Dr_Stocks sent you.
623 2018-12-25 17:16:26 High quality, low growth dividend yielding stocks. Peak valuations due to ultra low rates. Rising rates draws buyers to much safer assets like IG and treasury bonds.
624 2018-12-25 17:16:09 just give salem x3 the stocks and have him run it by himself.
625 2018-12-25 17:15:44 Twas a crazy and productive year! I'm a Stay@Home Dad now and my wife Krystal is working. Still learning how to become a voice actor, I think I might be doing pretty good with free work done so far. I'm getting much better at trading stocks now too. Merry Christmas everyone!
626 2018-12-25 17:15:23 Full employment means we are in need of more man power to meet the need of all the open jobs to fill. Not good especially when this administration is making it difficult for more immigrants to get into the country legally. Stocks are on a downward spiral with no relief in sight.
627 2018-12-25 17:15:12 Why's everyone so upset, in just a few more weeks stocks will be on sale at nice prices!
   #DowJones #stockmarket
628 2018-12-25 17:15:04 Niwaki jake? Actually no, Amazon I think. Same make (or one of) that he stocks tho, okatsune.
629 2018-12-25 17:13:57 Ummm my Personal portfolio has gone down 50% over the past two years. It was the strongest when Obama was in office. I’m not sure how you figure it’s the strongest now considering we’re losing money on stocks.
630 2018-12-25 17:13:33 1V1 ME, 3 STOCKS, NO ITEMS, FINAL DESTINATION
631 2018-12-25 17:13:23 Lots of non-wealthy people have retirement savings - most commonly 401ks. Which are getting decimated if people have some of the money in stocks which is typically part of the mix. And he's celebrating them losing that. Also as stocks tank it impacts companies and workers.
632 2018-12-25 17:12:06 @stevenmnuchin1 Many of us are speculating you shorted stocks and then caused a crisis. I’m betting we’re right. January is coming you will be investigated.
633 2018-12-25 17:11:54 ANY EXTRA STOCKS TAK ?!
634 2018-12-25 17:11:50 Financial markets may be in turmoil around the world!

Stocks price may move down!

Before u sell a stock...remember great businesses are built over many years and do not change overnight!

The more u think like a business owner..the less u would want to sell a stock!
635 2018-12-25 17:11:38 To all those who believe financial institutions have stopped flocking to #bitcoin, that won’t be the case as they’ll need to sell something and no one wants stocks or bonds! Get ready for alt invest discussions from advisors.
636 2018-12-25 17:10:52 US markets very oversold. Expect bounces in $spx, $rut, $ndx, $djx. Stocks are finally reasonably priced. Tariffs/trade war still pose the biggest threat to the economy. China needs to be stopped but it won’t be easy.
637 2018-12-25 17:10:25 $WDBG (formerly $NHPI) will run big IMO because of a few factors: 
1. Brand new ticker symbol
2. Stocks on the big boards are crashing and the penny stocks aren't affected as much and are flying
3. $WDBG is the top penny stock out there
4. Do your due diligence on this one
638 2018-12-25 17:10:07 My parent’s stock guy is trying to convince them to drag their feet on pulling their money out of stocks because if we pull it out all at once we will have to pay taxes on it. Like. They lost $100,000 out of their retirement savings so far I think it’s time to get out, Brad.
639 2018-12-25 17:09:15 Over last 6 years or so I've shared a fav stock of mine over December holidays when I have idle time to research (past include $twtr, $rlyp, $kite, $save, $tube we won't mention last year). Anyway. Found something I like for 2019 (in tech). I'd share but you all hate stocks now.
640 2018-12-25 17:09:04 Success in the market means investing for the long term and not play panic trading in times like these.  The market will recover, you just have to have the fortitude to hold out and trust that blue chips will always recover.  Stocks that pay dividends help to buy stock when low.
641 2018-12-25 17:08:22 The least we can say is the economy is better under your leadership right? 

“U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression.”
642 2018-12-25 17:07:59 How are tinfoil stocks doing? Psycho
643 2018-12-25 17:07:50 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin went to the major banks one by one, he asked, do you have enough cash available, you know just in case? Surprisingly this did not calm them. It scared them. Just in case what?  Stocks dropped more. Surprise!
644 2018-12-25 17:07:16 I agree but that works both ways.  People like Bill Gates gets the lion share of the value of stocks. The top 10% hold 80% of all stocks and bonds. The top 1% hold 40%. It's already being redistribitied.
645 2018-12-25 17:06:52 And the early options were very limited - only on a handful of stocks.
646 2018-12-25 17:06:49 I personally like bargain stocks HUN, BOYD, RUTH
647 2018-12-25 17:05:14 دعم قوي على .8
648 2018-12-25 17:05:03 Today is Isaac Newton 376th birthday & a lesson from him: 

Newton lost $4M in today’s terms B/C of investing in one stock in the bubble year of 1720 so:

1. #Markets are prone to bubble & crash
2. Diversify your portfolio
3. Have both long & short positions
#investing #stocks
649 2018-12-25 17:04:08 Get a paying job.

and pay taxes.

And save in bank account and invest in stocks, PPF, Real estate etc. 

You'll get 15 lakhs and more without have to beg.

651 2018-12-25 17:02:52 There’s a possible invader zim remake, I urge you all to invest in hot topic stocks immediately
652 2018-12-25 17:02:46 Merry Chrashmas!   Great economy. Stocks diving.
653 2018-12-25 17:02:42 Buying the dip can be problematic especially if the stocks continue to fall. When predicting where stocks will go there are only 2 types of people, those who don’t know and those who don’t know that they don’t know.
654 2018-12-25 17:02:31 FYI most working people who have a 401k invest in private prisons and don't know it. Especially if you dont hand pick ur stocks.
655 2018-12-25 17:02:26 Wilbur Ross has been reported shorting stocks in the past. Ritz people know how to make money no matter what the market's doing
656 2018-12-25 17:02:07 When stocks go up he is a genius, but when they go down, heads will roll...
657 2018-12-25 17:01:57 To every business that open (including the one is work for) you're a piece of shit and I hope your stocks fail next year.
658 2018-12-25 17:01:30 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica
659 2018-12-25 17:01:18 Nah just by playing stocks a enemy shows up every 2 or 3 games
660 2018-12-25 17:00:49 So you mean to tell stocks will fall heavily in 2019?? But my prediction is stocks will go 2times the current price.

665 2018-12-25 16:59:23 Just shows he has no clue of WTF he’s doing, as a @POTUS and as a father.  But whatevs ... Merry Christmas from my stocks to his!!!
666 2018-12-25 16:58:38 So if you play the game backwards (which is kinda cheating) aaaand you buy and sell the correct stocks, you *could* have broken even over 24 months?

Wow.... As an ex-broker, where do I get my bankroll on this opportunity??!
667 2018-12-25 16:58:27 Just want to graduate so I can learn about other things lol like stocks and random things
668 2018-12-25 16:58:05 Usually not. Equity lies beneath debt, which compromises stock. Do u know trading price of bonds senior to ur stocks?
669 2018-12-25 16:58:02 Stocks went down when Democrats won the house and the Fed raised interest rates some 7 times. They didnt even raise them ince for Obama in 8 yrs. Stocks still better now than Obama lol. NK and Syria better too.

672 2018-12-25 16:57:00 My cashapp stocks were jumping the other day.. Should've sold that shit when it was at it's peak
673 2018-12-25 16:56:36 I went to my broker's website, sorted my portfolio by dividend yield, and the top 4 are yielding 9-11% now.  I'm going to buy more in the next week, possibly tomorrow if stocks open down.

I deployed 1/3 of my cash in Oct and most of the rest in Dec, but still have some left.

675 2018-12-25 16:55:20 It always bounces back up. Wait until 2020, no matter who gets elected, the correlation with election years causes stocks to fluctuate like crazy so it might hit a nice bump and you'll be happy with returns!
676 2018-12-25 16:55:00 Does anyone think the bottom is in for stocks yet? Are there any buyers yet? With conviction? The faang stocks are on sale 50% off after Christmas. At these prices we will sell out fast.

681 2018-12-25 16:49:25 Fish stocks became massively depleted under EU CFP Management what re you talking about
682 2018-12-25 16:49:04 Any way I see many stocks and futures will be nice pincher which is my favorite.
683 2018-12-25 16:48:56 You don’t understand the nature of the crisis. Buying distressed equity in the banking syst3m was the solution. Once bank stocks revived, the  government sold the equities and abt broke even. Problem solved by the Obama Administration.
684 2018-12-25 16:48:39 Trump has not done a better job. He gave stocks an artificial sugar rush with the #TaxScam while creating historic deficits and chaos with haphazard tariffs and foreign “policy.” The market hates uncertainty and Trump is about to give us a LOT more.
685 2018-12-25 16:47:28 I love being an adult at christmas, the only thing people ever buy me are toiletries.. skin care products and deoderant. Literally each christmas stocks me up enough to last the year. I love it

695 2018-12-25 16:42:33 I thought I was the only one to pick stocks using a Ouija Board. 
696 2018-12-25 16:42:09 What’s really funny is that stocks collapsed right when Democrats won the house
697 2018-12-25 16:41:39 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
698 2018-12-25 16:41:20 Wait. Nothing is lost. Where did it go? It changed hands only. Who has that now? Or do you mean funny money as in market capital created by pumping their stocks?
699 2018-12-25 16:41:17 Sadly, the rich we're worried about have inside info and know how to short stocks and move assets, so not really.

702 2018-12-25 16:39:10 Any one in the USA claiming to be a 'conservative' deserves nothing more than Tar and Feathering, and then a few months in the stocks. 

The Reality is: People claiming to be 'conservatives' are actually just telling us they're assholes.

And we have the policies to back it up.
703 2018-12-25 16:38:43 It's just an example, from depression to euphoria.... auto stocks, capital goods etc., may deliver great returns in comparison with FMCG stocks.
704 2018-12-25 16:38:42 Interesting...but not fatal. During the Obama rule the stocks were in the tank consistently. Its all for the long term, but I love how when it suits their narrative that its the end of the world. Lions and tigers and BEARS..oh my! #liberalismisamentaldisorder

706 2018-12-25 16:38:26 Glad I sold a bunch of stocks when Trump was “elected “ and bought a motorcycle.
707 2018-12-25 16:38:05 @bingomisty Mr. Tri-ump tweeted it's a good time to buy stocks in the DIP- He speaks they will listen- The market will rise as per our leader BETCHA
708 2018-12-25 16:37:45 Buffett is famously bad at picking tech stocks, should just stick to what he’s good at.
709 2018-12-25 16:37:03 I own stocks,and I'm NOT RICH.
710 2018-12-25 16:36:39 This thread really sums up the treachery of Cryin Chuck Schumer and his ilk. They are the worst of the worst in politics and should be tarred and feathered and put in the stocks to face public shaming. How dare any elected official treat our vets and first responders that way! 
711 2018-12-25 16:35:50 That's when Carl Icahn said to Trump 'I have to go buy stocks'

712 2018-12-25 16:35:15 If people sell stocks and rebalance towards Tbills, we get missallocation: money flows to finance Walls rather than productive firms and innovation
713 2018-12-25 16:34:17 I want to tell you about stocks. Suppose I see $AMZN is real bottom, would I be excited to buy it as stock? No way, cuz it will continue to go down more then I will lose some. Good sample, if I buy it at 1300 and hold, then it goes more down to 1200, Is it good idea? No
714 2018-12-25 16:32:49 Watched financial news all day yesterday, half the so called “experts” think the fed overdid it & should roll back rates as soon as next week, while other “experts” say the fed did what was needed. I think it was too soon, but I’m sick of watching my stocks tank, I’m biased.
715 2018-12-25 16:32:29 I hear the recent market fluctuations have been caused by George Soros purposefully buying and selling stocks in large scale to control the market and make Trump look bad. There can be no other reason. 
716 2018-12-25 16:31:50 Trump took credit when Stocks went up.

They're down.

Now he blames the Fed.

Trump said he'd build a wall and Mexico would pay for it.

Mexico did not.

Now he blames the Democrats.

See the pattern?

Merry Christmas too all, except Trump, who can suck it.
717 2018-12-25 16:30:49 Not understanding how stocks work for 200.
718 2018-12-25 16:30:27 Nothing but smiling faces this morning. They got stocks, clothes, and someone has a plane ticket to go somewhere super exciting!!! Polar express last weekend & Aurora this upcoming weekend. This is IT until summer camps start! #everybodybetterhaveAs #NeviahIsaiahAudria
719 2018-12-25 16:30:17 Powell only hastened the pull back in Stocks. It was going to happen anyway.
720 2018-12-25 16:29:42 2&20 for a guy to read the WSJ and put you into momo bubble stocks. LOL
721 2018-12-25 16:29:19 We keep hearing DT blame the Fed for stocks falling. But the Fed was here the last 10 years known as the Obama Bull Market, which may be ending (S&P 500 & Nasdaq already in Bear territory & Dow only 330 points to go).
722 2018-12-25 16:28:58 “Stocks in mainland China fell on Christmas Day, mimicking the  losses in Japan and the United States exacerbated by an intensifying riff between the White House and US Federal Reserve. Hong Kong markets are closed until Thursday.”
723 2018-12-25 16:28:23 I’ve been calling this crash for the last 2 years. I believe it’ll get much much worse. I talked to some people about it a few months ago, and they were like yeah but how do you know

Stocks fall 25%

I see them again, and I’m like “see” and they still have absolutely no interest
724 2018-12-25 16:28:02 WHERE CAN I INVEST IN THEM LOL GLAM STOCKS
725 2018-12-25 16:27:36 How bout dem stocks
726 2018-12-25 16:27:19 Someone with the right access needs to check if Trump, Mnuchin, and/or their proxies have been shorting stocks.
727 2018-12-25 16:25:09 No one is in command? Stocks are falling! This country needs a leader. Where are you??? Hiding?
728 2018-12-25 16:24:17 Lol marketwatch pundits will spend the entire recession telling us we’re not in a recession and recommending overpriced tech stocks.
729 2018-12-25 16:23:46 How obtuse of you. Many retirement funds and 401ks are made up of stocks, at least in part. “Rich people” can withstand these losses; everyday Americans can not and they are the ones being hurt right now.
730 2018-12-25 16:23:18 Sir apollo , jubl  etc one day up next day down and opposite to nifty. Such stocks hit our stop loss and then move 
731 2018-12-25 16:23:02 . I’m over here preparing for that day to arrive. *stocks up on groceries, ammunition, and bibles* which part had you shook the most.
732 2018-12-25 16:22:24 Smart people are PULLING MONEY out of stocks!!! adolf trump has promised to SINK MARKETS LOWER AND LOWER!!!! My Finance Guy told me to PULL IT ALL OUT OF THE MARKET BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!!!
733 2018-12-25 16:21:40 When the middle class gets paid well or receives tax relief they spend that money back into the economy. The 1% buy stocks and hoard generally because they haven’t the same need. If you live amongst the 1% and are part of the service industry, you benefit.
734 2018-12-25 16:21:16 Sirji ...not necessary to buy stocks during a crash ...you can buy movie tickets n chips n some juice or colas for sometime n Dabur too 
735 2018-12-25 16:20:41 And he owns over 100 cos, holding period in most is less than 1 year, owns every sector he disliked and never added many stocks as if mkt was closed and he owned business. The least understood in behaviour- sharp mind that adapts well
736 2018-12-25 16:20:09 What did you get us this year? Bump stocks? Oh, no that's right you pushed to have those banned. Glad to see my money's hard at work on infringements...
737 2018-12-25 16:18:57 Nut Job in the WH is SINKING STOCKS FURTHER!!! DON'T LOSE IT ALL!!! PULL YOUR MONEY FROM THE MARKET NOW!!!!!
738 2018-12-25 16:18:24 Oh please get off your soapbox making such false assumptions. How would EU fishermen still be fishing in our waters after March? We’d take back our territorial waters and stop them. They could then go to other countriesand decimate their fish stocks instead of ours.
739 2018-12-25 16:18:08 $DSGT Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down." That's what value investing is all about.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
740 2018-12-25 16:17:09 The major indexes on Wall Street fell another 2 percent Monday, making it very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931. 
Grow up!
741 2018-12-25 16:16:51 @realDonaldTrump I’m calling BS on that fed workers say stay the course. No one wants to not be able to work. People want paychecks because EVERYONE’S 401k and stocks are tanking. Even onChristmas day, you can’t tell the truth. Disgraceful.
742 2018-12-25 16:16:46 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your autism

Remember, when stocks go up, it's proof of Trump's genius, but when they go down, it's someone else's fault. Probably a conspiracy by the deep state's allies, the deep private sector.
746 2018-12-25 16:15:15 NYT"s Friedman restating Carville's "It's the economy, stupid": "For the 1st 2 years of the Trump presidency the markets treated his dishonesty & craziness as background noise to all the soaring corporate profits & stocks. But that is no longer the case. [He] has markets worried"
747 2018-12-25 16:13:42 Please God tell me Trump did not close govt to focus on what stocks fell so he could buy ...Saudi Bank Merger?
748 2018-12-25 16:13:28 So what you’re saying is the steps you predicted are happening? Stocks are being sold off and money is being laundered all over the world today...
749 2018-12-25 16:13:02 What about 3 stocks 7 minutes? For some reason I think 8 minutes is too much and 6 minutes is too short for this game.

Stop talking. Stop tweeting.

I transferred all of my investments from stocks to Gold when he said that....

757 2018-12-25 16:10:04 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression. #TrumpResign
758 2018-12-25 16:09:54 In Dec 2008 I persuaded my brother to go all in on stocks , thinking was things so bad could have systemic failure and money in bank would evaporate, I have cash to put in again buyer at 1950 on SP 500 or 18000 on Dow May be there before you know it.,

765 2018-12-25 16:06:31 Why would the stock market demand deficit reduction when corporations clearly rake in the money and their stocks skyrocket from deficit spending?

768 2018-12-25 16:05:01 He does have a point (in a convoluted manner). Raising interest rates every quarter spooks investors so stocks will go down. It also makes older bonds with fixed return rates unprofitable, which will spook investors even more leading to massive sell offs.

770 2018-12-25 16:02:47 Lynch said that in a sorry market, when a blue chip stock crash 40-50%, stocks vulnerable to macros may crash 80-85%. 

Example:Dabur VS Ashok Leyland.

So, do you think buying Leyland is better than Dabur (for greater returns)
771 2018-12-25 16:00:08 7) Capitalism is also a system that feeds on the exploitation of the working class. If you genuinely cared about the working class, you’d advocate an end to capitalist exploitation, not cry crocodile tears over stocks.
772 2018-12-25 15:59:43 @realDonaldTrump US stocks had their worst Christmas Eve on record.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading companies fell more than 650 points on Monday, and is on track for its worst December since 1931, during the Great Depression.
773 2018-12-25 15:59:38 Buy back  is a cheating program to the stocks holders.  Calming and holding and helping company stay put while crisis. That's all company need.
774 2018-12-25 15:59:13 Only in the "refined" world of finance would a disaster that wipes out people's investments be called a "correction." But nobody knew when or how much "correct," including the "experts" who were advising them. Expertise is always backwards-looking, not forward-looking.

777 2018-12-25 15:58:08 absolutely love spending 4 hours on a bus to come home and stare at the back of my dads head while he reviews his stocks!
778 2018-12-25 15:58:06 By this i mean "things can't get any better" in the actual economy.  They can only get worse.
So what happens when it shows it's getting worse? Boom
I mean, stocks are tanking even on earnings beat+raise... so what happens when they miss?????
779 2018-12-25 15:57:57 Top Stock searches on message boards and Twitter: $USO $FDX $AAPL $ERO $A (10:57 am) #stocks #finance #stockmarket #StockPicks
780 2018-12-25 15:57:04 One scary thought: Once the market does (deat cat) bounce, what will Trump/GOP do? Maybe they'll feel bullish again and tweet a very hawkish comment on China trade? Throughout this year they were exactly like that, except they can't prop stocks up anymore $SPX $RUT $NDX
781 2018-12-25 15:56:32 @piersmorgan ruined @POTUS44 & @MichelleObama Christmas 4 years ago, this Christmas he ruins the “Gatwick couples” Christmas by vilifying them before they was released without charge as they was innocent.
It’s a shame he can’t be put in “stocks” for a week at the Tower of London.
782 2018-12-25 15:56:29 I had a dude who played peach T-bagged me when the stocks were 1-2 went into sudden death and charged into him when he tried to float
783 2018-12-25 15:56:06 are we gonna talk about the stocks being hella down right now or get these tweets off ?
784 2018-12-25 15:54:46 For me, it's normal not to panic during the stock market selloff. Because I have known for many years of investing that stocks always rise over the long-term-as best as I also remember that we are living going forward to the future-mind you we don't live back to the past.
785 2018-12-25 15:54:42 Me and the wife and searching #Tickers doing some dd @TheStreet @royalfinancials @chatwithtraders @GrantCardone @RamseyShow @DaveRamsey She seems to find all the stocks with volume during this crash lol
786 2018-12-25 15:54:02 What a MESS you have made!!! Obama handed you a robust economy and rising stock market and in less than 2 years you CRASHED THE MARKETS!!!! BIG, BIG TROUBLE AHEAD!!! Better to have money under mattress than stocks!!!
787 2018-12-25 15:53:35 AMERICA,,THE PEOPLE NEVER SAW THINGS SO GOOD AFTER OBAMA BAD YRS!THAT MEANS DEMS WAS CROOKS ALL OBAMA YRS,,THE STOCKS HITTING 25 WASN'T GOOD

789 2018-12-25 15:52:28 You are not doing a good job as President. You have single-handedly caused a bear market in stocks with a pointless tariff war with China. They can outlast the US even tho their economy is not as robust. You will not get your concessions from Xi.
790 2018-12-25 15:51:20 Top 10 Stocks of the Month - Insider Buying:  ECC, CORI, ACAD, GSAT, THOR, GRA, EIDX, ZANDZ, INSG, and CVNA.
791 2018-12-25 15:51:00 The Fed basically is screaming over a megaphone & telling investors to sell their stocks & buy bonds instead. There is no other way to interpret the Fed promise that it will raise rates three more times next year without any real lengthy pause to see how the economy is affected.
792 2018-12-25 15:50:53 "Investors are uncertain"
"Investors are Skittish"

No.

Your average investor has stocks in 401k's

The #market movement we see is from the lane hoppers.

Switching from stock to stock chasing a tip their hooker, or neighbor, or a pop culture magazine offered.

#DowJones
793 2018-12-25 15:50:53 Just like the market never showed a clear decline until a few months later, when it starts climbing back it will do the same.

If you stocks are undervalued right now, start buying in 4 tranches, 1 every 1 or 2 months
794 2018-12-25 15:50:38 Markets are down because CEOs have been dumping back the same stocks their companies bought back using over leverage. Don’t blame trump or fed  for this. Ridiculous to see CNBC can’t give facts behind market turmoil.
795 2018-12-25 15:50:15 Guess you don’t own stocks -good for you- and probably don’t make minimum wage.fuull employment doesn’t mean enough money to live on
796 2018-12-25 15:50:01 we all scream for the inevitability of losing your stocks
797 2018-12-25 15:49:30 I’m willing to forgive Sean McElwee’s dumbass stocks tweet as long as he’s abolished ICE as promised. So let me just open up this newspaper and take a sip of water and
798 2018-12-25 15:49:29 Honestly out of the sample set -  3 out of five have or will. 2 are the get rich quick types. Ie.. just looking at weed stocks the last 5 months
799 2018-12-25 15:49:14 Probably sent them bump stocks too 
800 2018-12-25 15:49:04 Hello I wake up to more news of stocks plummeting. Happy Christmas
801 2018-12-25 15:48:37 I never believe in EU market. 1 of 13 countries disagree Dead end then market goes off. They are all mess. Better get aways from their problems. Stocks never be up don't wish.

803 2018-12-25 15:47:47 What stocks do you recommend?
804 2018-12-25 15:47:26 @nbsalert hi which branch do you sell moleskin pen+. Looks like it was sold out in Makati branch but there are stocks for the notebook though. Thanks :)
805 2018-12-25 15:47:10 Tu sors ça gratos des stocks ? ;)
806 2018-12-25 15:47:01 Ho ho ho. I'm a former big bank VP (w/ ovaries!) and clearly wiser: 
If it IS very serious (and it may be, it's overdue), just hang onto your stocks. 
And relax.
ALL the past recessions resulted in higher stock prices.
807 2018-12-25 15:46:03 no.  I blame the Fed. by announcing they still plan to raise the funds rate three times  NEXT year & never seem to wait & see what effect its past rate hikes are having or its selling of bonds,,,,Fed is screaming to investors to get out of stocks now & buy up bonds. Trump's right
808 2018-12-25 15:45:19 I figured it out! president Trump is planning on building the wall with confiscated bump stocks and the other gun parts that he will ban for necessary building supplies.
809 2018-12-25 15:44:00 I started trading stocks 3 years ago. My family and friends are freaking out on their 401k. I am just sipped hot cocoa.
810 2018-12-25 15:43:24 Not to mention they have people who invest for them who employ techniques like shorting, so they can make money when stocks go down
811 2018-12-25 15:43:03 From charts it appear 432/345/208 Support levels

I didn't have this stock in my list of Pharma stocks. I Generally avoid stocks that have big debts on their book. So, I presume this stock might have debt. That's the reason why I didn't have in my sheet.
812 2018-12-25 15:43:01 Nan mais pas livraison dans ce sens la livraison dans le sens ou c'est vous qui vous faites livrer les stocks et tu dois les ranger
813 2018-12-25 15:42:21 stocks were at an all time high when the gop controlled both the houses
814 2018-12-25 15:42:01 Oh no all my stocks lol
815 2018-12-25 15:41:56 To add, I think there are 2 types of value traps. Most investors try to avoid stocks that deteriorate fundamentally after purchase. Those are "traps". Sometimes, a value stock will continue to decline, while the fundamentals remain the same. That is not a trap.
816 2018-12-25 15:41:41 in short stocks are also like universal bubbles of energy which go like balloon with time or energy or situations.
817 2018-12-25 15:41:20 Y’all a couple months ago: E’Dawn and Hyuna deserve to be happy together. The only hereto couple allowed rights. Fuck cube lives. Cube stocks are dropping lol 

Y’all now: Hyuna and E’Dawn are so annoying omg. All they do is post about each other. Unfollowing them now 
818 2018-12-25 15:40:47 I guess they picked the wrong stocks.  Mine increased 36% this year.
819 2018-12-25 15:40:20 HFT players are largely absent from the R2K stocks...no vol amplification-effect there, they stick to liquid names and amplify the vol on illiquid days...
820 2018-12-25 15:40:01 You wouldn’t need to write it in ALL CAPS if you believed it was true.  In fact, you wouldn’t need to say it at all.  There would be no question. Unfortunately, it is not true.  We are laughing stocks around the world for having elected an idiot as our President.
821 2018-12-25 15:39:59 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
822 2018-12-25 15:39:38 Stocks dont go up forever. Typically stocks take a breather in the third year of a presidential term. The fed pumping the brakes so hard with interest rate raises triggered the sell off.
823 2018-12-25 15:39:15 Yes, your 401k is gone Merry Christmas Yes ,your stocks the money you had in the market isn’t worth the cost of the paper your stock certificates are written on, Merry Christmas. The soon to follow massive layoffs and cutbacks of jobs by Companies loosing millions in the market
824 2018-12-25 15:39:10 People I know who have money have all said the same thing. Their stocks have taken a massive hit this year.
825 2018-12-25 15:38:57 Fed can’t be responsible for stock market performance. As it is the markets have gone up by 6000 points since trump took over. Companies have used over leverage for buybacks and then ceos  have dumped back the same stocks.  Powell is avoiding another financial crisis.
826 2018-12-25 15:38:26 I brought these stocks back, they're defective, I want store credit
827 2018-12-25 15:37:11 Nobody believes you. U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression.
828 2018-12-25 15:35:12 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression.
829 2018-12-25 15:35:03 I do, you don't have to be specific nobody is asking for secrets, I try to find out what they are investing the money in, loans, stocks, real-estate, fish farming etc.. It needs to make sense to me before I invest. I don't invest in financial instruments that I don't understand.
830 2018-12-25 15:33:26 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression.
831 2018-12-25 15:32:20 Yep. Driving markets down so he and Kushner can afford to buy stocks then sell high. The old banana in the tail pipe trick. Corruption at it Orangest!
832 2018-12-25 15:32:12 Just a few bump stocks
833 2018-12-25 15:31:41 That IS the good news. Huge sale on stocks, buy while you can.
834 2018-12-25 15:31:33 The stock market reflects big biz which employs 30% of all workers compared to small biz which employs 70% of all workers. So the economy can be good but stocks can be down. They both don't have to be the same.
835 2018-12-25 15:30:50 When stocks decline as much as they have, it’s a sell off!
836 2018-12-25 15:30:26 Is it supposed to be $0.25 not $0.025.  $0.025 is less that current $0.08
837 2018-12-25 15:29:48 Stocks trade on fundamentals and corporate vision going forward. Trumps behavior has triggered this. People are hitting the sidelines!
838 2018-12-25 15:29:35 I am willing to bet you own zero stocks and know nothing about the Stock Market Darman. Lmao
839 2018-12-25 15:28:50 The case for a reflexive bounce:

• VIX isn't at these levels very long
• Put/Call numbers indicate short squeeze fuel is in place
• stocks below 50 DMA are at washout levels
• downside targets for broad indexes are now reached

These mean NOTHING without price confirmation.
840 2018-12-25 15:28:30 I wonder if Mr Trump own stocks on the S-400 missile system the Russians are selling to the Turks?
841 2018-12-25 15:27:02 Not Feds job to control stocks
842 2018-12-25 15:25:48 isn't it irresponsible for the Fed to have a key rate in its head,then just bulldoze towards taking 3 years to raise to that rate? Fed says it will raise rates 3 more times next year. Why would it predict that? Fed is basically telling people to sell their stocks & buy bonds. No?
843 2018-12-25 15:25:17 I agree Mr. President! But it has created a wonderful buying opportunity! Our country is stronger than ever and so is our economy! I am a buyer! I never thought I would get a chance to buy stocks at this price ever again. Thank you for this great Christmas present! God bless USA!
844 2018-12-25 15:24:55 @jimsciutto @RonBrownstein @abbydphillip Uncertainty sliding Markets costing all who have 401Ks or stocks which have dropped by 20% for No Reason needing a new approach here since cutting Ur Nose to spite Ur Face ain’t Prudent at any time S/B like Prison Reform Bipartisan...
845 2018-12-25 15:24:07 Bill Clinton guaranteeing excessive home loans to every American caused the last financial crisis. Period. To call a three week blip a “financial crisis” is ignorant. The stock market is bloated. By your own admission the economy is good. Stocks are just too fat.
846 2018-12-25 15:23:45 Timid children. Let’s go balls-out and tear it to the ground, start over. Stocks so cheap even my poorest friends can invest. Redistribute the wealth. EAT THE RICH am I getting carried away yet.
847 2018-12-25 15:23:34 That’s why I think the market is being manipulated for companies to buy back stock, short stocks and buy in cheap. Big money has been waiting with stockpiles of cash.
848 2018-12-25 15:23:09 Merry Christmas! Great buying opportunity for stocks.
849 2018-12-25 15:22:45 I don’t disagree but what do they have to do with Parkland shooting? My impression, with exception of bump stocks, firearm legislation remains unchanged from Obama administration? What did DJT “break” that would have made a difference in FL shooting?
850 2018-12-25 15:21:08 He has no stocks, as he has no $
851 2018-12-25 15:19:46 Don’t cry.  While stocks are low your money buys more then when it rebounds you’re WAY up on your game! 
852 2018-12-25 15:19:40 Nope, tried that in support of Obama when stocks tripled. Their answer is he had nothing to do with it. They Boasted about how well stocks were doing under Trump. If I asked now, Trump has nothing to do with the fall.
853 2018-12-25 15:19:11 Just saw a commercial for some investing portfolio app with Danny Devito and I CANNOT believe the commercial wasn't something like "oh excuse me I dropped my MAGNUM PORTFOLIO for my MONSTER STOCKS"
854 2018-12-25 15:18:10 @realDonaldTrump Congratulations! U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression.
855 2018-12-25 15:17:59 Yea whatever stocks tank. #GovShutdown
856 2018-12-25 15:17:05 Each time the Fed intervenes in a crisis it sets up the next crisis. The amplitude increases with each crisis, the "fix" needs to be bigger. Last crisis was banks and RE, w/ QE stocks became the place to go. 

If QT drops stks the 2nd order fail is pension plans, the real crisis.
857 2018-12-25 15:16:26 Spoken like someone who doesn’t own any stocks.
858 2018-12-25 15:16:24 Noone will probably see this but if you want stocks to rise back up,BUILD THE PROTECTIVE BORDER WALL.
OTHERWISE, MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL THAT DO SEE THIS.
859 2018-12-25 15:16:20 Thanks for the Insolvency Code. You will find more such companies falling in line to reduce Debt. Sugar stocks too will follow !
860 2018-12-25 15:15:33 im looking at my phone for movement in stocks
861 2018-12-25 15:13:20 US stocks had their worst Christmas Eve on record
The economy is doing so well under Trump :)
862 2018-12-25 15:12:53 Delta commenced its operation of production yesterday thus they couldn't continue as per their schedule of stock counting.Any day prior to 24-12-18  its stocks on soft drinks was limited they have failed to meet demand its so unsual of it.I do second @BitiTendai's narrative.
863 2018-12-25 15:12:27 Was thinking exactly the same thing. Short stocks -> tweet -> $$$ -> buy low and go long
864 2018-12-25 15:12:26 Irony Nifty is trading at 11k which is a dream level of 2018 and still major stocks are down 20-40% and portfolios are bleeding... 
865 2018-12-25 15:10:43 Asia stocks sink after Wall Street's Christmas Eve plunge cnn
All  political stunts 
Worry not they will go back up 
#Trump wins 2020
866 2018-12-25 15:10:31 I think 16K Dow will be a good time to jump back into stocks.
867 2018-12-25 15:10:10 Even with planes, trains, and other #transport #stocks having a very rough and tough December I remain long & #BULLISH on $CSX even with a 3 month return of -19.84% the YTD return is positive at 6.82% #StockMarket #markets #investments #investing #WallStreet #economics #economy
868 2018-12-25 15:10:03 I remember when #obama tried to say stocks were cheap and fumbled on P/E ratios which it clearly came out he had no idea what he was talking about.  The market did go up, however so we’ll see how Trump’s buy statement this morning does. $spy
869 2018-12-25 15:09:59 @BillAckman Bill, should the major indexes continue to fall, SPY towards 200 for example; will healthcare stocks begin to diverge from the trend and begin to stabilize? I would think companies with large fixed debt would be safe in 2019; even Teva.
870 2018-12-25 15:09:53 Checking on his vegetable stocks.
871 2018-12-25 15:09:34 Many stocks in a similar position.  2019 will bring a bounce but may be short lived.  Protect your capital.
872 2018-12-25 15:08:49 Those who are not buying stocks are missing out on the Christmas gift  

It’ll unwrap itself in couple years.
873 2018-12-25 15:08:07 The filthy rich/recipients of Trump's tax giveaways want stocks pushed lower so they can do their buybacks b4 year end. Otherwise, you'd hear the rich screaming at the top of their lungs making phone calls to end the chaos in DC.
874 2018-12-25 15:07:30 Va falloir attendre janvier je pense. Le temps qu'ils remettent les stocks.
875 2018-12-25 15:05:36 I'll be buying tons of stocks during the huge drop thanks to him then selling them when he leaves for a heafty profit.
876 2018-12-25 15:05:05 I would say silver bars and stocks
877 2018-12-25 15:04:08 its cool but its stocks so its less cool
878 2018-12-25 15:03:45 Stocks are on sale 
879 2018-12-25 15:01:55 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression. 
So. 
Much. 
Winning.
@POTUS #asshatinchief
880 2018-12-25 15:01:14 Not to mention is you actually have money, you can short different stocks and make money on them falling - not something I can do on my 401k

1. #tradingportfolio 
2. Buy and hold growth stocks don't post anything about this on Twitter. This is #technofunda strategy
3. #nifty #banknifty futures options trades holding 3-4 days max
884 2018-12-25 14:59:58 Thank god.... 2019 will be a very VERY bad year for stocks
885 2018-12-25 14:57:49 before you did not give trump credit to anything.   So, if you are saying back then he wasn't responsible for the stocks going up, you can't blame him for them going down.  sorry
886 2018-12-25 14:56:59 The people buying and selling stocks probably don't have the emotional maturity to buy & sell ANYTHING. The world is no different today than it was when the Stock Market was at its best day. Chicken Littles are realizing Donald is in the WH and the damage he could do worldwide.

889 2018-12-25 14:55:58 So since they cant get their way, they plunge our stocks into the gutter, and then blame the President? Even though if during the Obama Admin. if we said that we were all racist? Right! Sure!
890 2018-12-25 14:55:31 The corruption is unacceptable. I’m not sure it is reasonable to not allow them to own stocks but some mechanism in place to keep them from insider trading. Arresting & putting them in prison wouldn’t serve as a deterrent bc they seem to feel the rules aren’t actually for them.
891 2018-12-25 14:55:01 Will not a merry Christmas for all people who trust and voted you. Soybean farmers, stocks investors, federal workers who will not have salary, etc. Worst president ever!!

893 2018-12-25 14:54:34 Yes, well, then there is this:
U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression, Federal employees not paid, Russia Gate, cruelty on border,career criminals..
894 2018-12-25 14:54:16 I posted a snap shot of the stocks to my cousins post about how good things are under trump... he called it fake news 
895 2018-12-25 14:52:33 Out of stocks:(
896 2018-12-25 14:52:26 $spy. The Fed spent the last 10 yrs forcing people into stocks by making cash worthless. Now they have reversed course and stocks are in withdrawals just like a junkie. It’s the game, go with the flow

900 2018-12-25 14:50:52 Stocks continue loosing their values so does peoples retirement account. and counting down,Who is going to pay for that
901 2018-12-25 14:50:48 She probably sells the stocks that he recommends. It's kind of cheating but only for the money
902 2018-12-25 14:50:15 Yesterday, was the worst #ChristmasEve #trading day EVER for the #SP500 & #Dow #DowJones #DJIA #stocks #StockMarket #markets #investments #investing #WallStreet #Finance #economics #economy
903 2018-12-25 14:49:06 He just HAD to be MORE famous, just HAD to try to get a new TV show as result of his candidacy.

What he got:  America headed for a great recession.  The world hates us, Allies cut off.  Putin & autocrats own him, he does their bidding.  Stocks crash/kids in cages.

Prison looms.
904 2018-12-25 14:45:24 Er, it’s one of the strong stocks in the US. BK? 
905 2018-12-25 14:45:09 So glad I down own any of that crap stocks.
906 2018-12-25 14:44:58 Who would’ve thought this would now actually be bullish for stocks. At least imo
907 2018-12-25 14:44:56 1987....was at the Drake Hotel in Chicago..  Had recently moved all stocks to gold funds.  Guy gets on elevator says markets crashed.  I was secretly, ghoulishly, delighted.  Later found that ALL stocks tanked including GOLD.  Margin calls got ‘em.
908 2018-12-25 14:44:33 Obama achieved exactly ZERO #GunControl over 8 years in office. 
@realDonaldTrump bypassed Congress by using the ATF to make bump stocks illegal. 
Trump promised to protect our #2A rights?

Dude is a fucking liar!!!
909 2018-12-25 14:44:13 @realDonaldTrump hey shut yo dam mouth for like 4 months so my stocks can recover
910 2018-12-25 14:43:31 #SaudiArabia will pay to build #Syria like #Mexico paid to build your wall. $0 #TheTwoWitnesses #Stocks #MerryChrismas #Ts
911 2018-12-25 14:43:28 Stocks are crashing because people are terrified of the Democrats coming in with an angry spiteful wrecking ball, just to get their feelings vindicated
912 2018-12-25 14:42:46 And these millennials who are saddled with tremendous debt won’t be able to buy the overvalued assets (houses, stocks, etc...) that the baby boomers have accumulated over their lives to finance their retirements. This won’t end well for anyone.
913 2018-12-25 14:41:43 Interest rate rises are accounted for however trump tweeting and picking fights are causing more uncertainty and damaging stocks imo
914 2018-12-25 14:41:07 It’s not a Merry Christmas when you destroy the value of our stocks and our country every day.
Please Resign ASAP
915 2018-12-25 14:40:06 Ya, that's why Pelosie was doing business with China and Waters used Obama bail out funds to save her husbands stocks.

Trumps name was on the business, he didn't run it.
916 2018-12-25 14:39:03 The Federal Reserve should have raised interest rates in 2014, everyone is addicted to easy & cheap money, no one should be buying & selling stocks based on presidential tweets & Washington DC policy. A change in Middle East policy isn't a good reason to sell shares of Coca-Cola.
917 2018-12-25 14:38:17 If stocks decline tomorrow I have a shopping list to go back up to 50% but I think the stock markets decline is justified and not irrational.
918 2018-12-25 14:38:03 okay will fill it out now then. i hope there will be extra stocks  thank you so much for accommodating my order! 
919 2018-12-25 14:38:03 Gee you have seen the US STOCKS -TANK -BIG TME !! ALA Beware
920 2018-12-25 14:37:39 WRONG -- Truth is media telling persons do not trade stocks and look all minorities working -- would you invest in -- Never
921 2018-12-25 14:37:01 Stocks on track for the worst December since the great depression! Always the biggest and the best! Merry Christmas POS !
922 2018-12-25 14:36:40 As my stocks go down the toilet, eh?  
923 2018-12-25 14:36:27 Meanwhile...Stocks on track for worst December since the Great Depression.
924 2018-12-25 14:35:53 What is brewing in these stocks?Volume up many times the  daily average.possibly some manipulation in a week market.
925 2018-12-25 14:34:24 Hey Carm,

The VAST majority of 401k’s are still in mutual funds and have a positive correlation with stock prices. 

Exception is international funds or govt bonds. You might not see the same correlation.

But the middle class is mostly reliant on mutual funds/equity stocks
926 2018-12-25 14:32:48 really name a company who needs stocks not only to raise funds
927 2018-12-25 14:32:31 Stocks r still way higher than when your boy obummer was in office!!!!!!! Obummer and the Democrats sold our souls to Iran !!!! How many millions????
928 2018-12-25 14:31:37 You mean you're not supposed to sell in a mad panic at the bottom, then stay on the sidelines for 9 years while the market roars back, and then, just as it gets frothy, put your whole life savings into stocks because "it's gone up for 9 years", and then sell at the bottom again?
929 2018-12-25 14:31:06 There’s so many other Countries to trade with,but yet you still trade with China. The only reason they are down people need better wages to buy things. So $16.00 hr you can have a better happier Life . When 100 things are being bought is better then just 10 , Stocks go up .
930 2018-12-25 14:30:51 Literally every stock on the main screen of my Stocks app is in the negative. 

Melty Crimsauce!
931 2018-12-25 14:30:24 @realDonaldTrump worst Christmas stocks on record. Tired of winning?
932 2018-12-25 14:30:16 Sell stocks so I can buy them cheap and retire in a few years. Brilliant!
933 2018-12-25 14:29:54 Trump; cornered with no way out. Can’t lie, cheat, bully, or buy his way out. Most of his business dealings are 1 sided with Trump winning & everyone else loosing. Stocks are the beginning of the fall & I hope the cost is only 
$$ Not lives.
934 2018-12-25 14:28:57 Dow plunges in worst Christmas Eve for stocks in history
935 2018-12-25 14:28:50 @YenNee_Lee I guess you want all working Americans to panic and sell all of their stocks and ruing their retirement: 'The worst is yet to come': Experts say a global bear market is just getting started
936 2018-12-25 14:27:40 Then spend the money, or stay in stocks or bonds. There's not such thing as a high return, risk free investment.  If you chose the high-return high-risk option don't whine when an occasional lost sets you back.
937 2018-12-25 14:27:14 @CNBC This is a irresponsible fear mongering article, what about ALL the CNBC talking heads say this is a "normal correction" and have been recommending stocks, expect more: 'The worst is yet to come': Experts say a global bear market is just getting started
938 2018-12-25 14:26:50 Gold holds it value. When stocks are going down people move assets to gold and silver cause it holds the value where the dollar does not. Crypto is another place to run and hide too
939 2018-12-25 14:26:34 Who are all these retirement plan managers that are still putting seniors' cash into stocks in a bear market? I get they exist and people will lose savings if the market crashes but nobody is holding a gun to the managers' heads on a weirdly unstable investment
940 2018-12-25 14:26:34 Trump shouldn’t have fired the woman who made stocks rise and replace him with this guy then.
941 2018-12-25 14:26:08 Not supporting trump. But please tell me that you know the stock market is not a gauge of the economy. Its also was part of the reason the economy crashed in 08 because banks make all there money from our money in stocks.
942 2018-12-25 14:26:03 stocks are bought and sold on futures. since November 6th (election day) the Dow Jones has lost 17%. investors are panicking because Blue will be taking over the House
943 2018-12-25 14:25:55 They don’t do stocks! So they don’t know and they don’t care. I’m afraid to look at my portfolio and won’t until I’m mentally prepared.
944 2018-12-25 14:25:39 Coworker took some of his and paid off his mortgage.  Said he would take the tax hit, but he would get something out of his accounts this time around and it would be one less thing to worry about.  When stocks initally rose, he thought he had made a mistake, but now....
945 2018-12-25 14:25:16 But by then, consumer stocks of all kinds had rolled over, the curve had fully inverted, and commodity costs were rising.  Not remotely the case now
946 2018-12-25 14:25:12 hey @zerodhaonline can you tell me how to put individual chart setting on stocks and save them.  eg trending,  fibo levels etc I want to save for many stocks individually.  Thanks in advance.
947 2018-12-25 14:25:06 halaaaa daghan pa ug stocks didto?
948 2018-12-25 14:25:06 Well, stocks tanked again on Christmas Eve. How’s the Trump government shutdown affecting you? He’s holding out in the White House probably with plenty of borscht.
949 2018-12-25 14:24:31 I wonder if the old adage 'buy low, sell high' still applies? Now would be the time to load up on energy stocks.

952 2018-12-25 14:24:14 Japanese stocks plunge after Trump sparks US market fall
Japan's main stock index has fallen more than 5% following heavy losses on Wall Street.The Nikkei 225 dived in morning trade to its lowest point since April 2017 after US markets lost more than 2% in Monday trading.
953 2018-12-25 14:23:46 why does every Sonic online run 2 stocks.
954 2018-12-25 14:23:38 No to crypto or bit coins. Easy chances of getting bust. I would rather go with stocks.
955 2018-12-25 14:23:28 1. They don’t know what the word “marginal”means. 2. They don’t own stocks or understand the stock market.
956 2018-12-25 14:23:03 It's marginal, at best.

Stocks down.

Economy down.

U.S. world standing, down.

Allies, down. Literally. As in dead by your tweeting hand.

Compassion down.
957 2018-12-25 14:22:51 The market is really just a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism, which makes stocks too expensive, and unjustified pessimism, which makes them too cheap. All we should do is to keep a level head, sell to the optimists, and buy from the pessimists.
958 2018-12-25 14:22:32 Trump supporters don’t have stocks or 401 ks. They are the ones living paycheck to paycheck, and they think he’s the second coming.
959 2018-12-25 14:21:41 Facts - Every major downturn in stocks over the past 60 years has occurred during a GOP administration.

This one is no different.
960 2018-12-25 14:21:13 Happy birthday blonde haired, blue eyed baby Jesus. #MAGA #Wall #SteelSlats #Stocks #QAnon #Winning #FlatEarth #Creationism #CrackerBarrel #TruckNuts #BeBest.
961 2018-12-25 14:21:11 @realDonaldTrump “Shall not be infringed” applies to bump stocks. Recreation, defense... no matter the reason... shall not be infringed!
962 2018-12-25 14:21:08 He clearly was equating stocks with wealth in urging us to celebrate these losses as the rich getting their just desserts. I pointed out lots of regular folks are getting hurt. And you called that condescending. Ok.
963 2018-12-25 14:20:30 He may actually think that only rich ppl have stocks and it seemed like you were looking down on him for when he might just be uninformed. You’ve educated ppl(myself included) so many times. He may think that because of circumstance and you overlooked that imo.
964 2018-12-25 14:20:20 50% of Americans own stocks. Hardly just the GOP and Madoff crowd.
965 2018-12-25 14:20:16 Merry Christmas!
I got everyone stocks this year!! :)
966 2018-12-25 14:19:56 lesson learned mag advance shopping para di na rush at madami stocks hahah.
967 2018-12-25 14:19:27 A good chunk of his base are under utilized mid western folks on welfare. They don’t get it. Stocks don’t have anything to do with their coal jobs. So long as they have work that’s all that matters to them. It’s the biggest problem facing Dems is getting to those people.

970 2018-12-25 14:18:30 I don't think USA has anything to worry about. We're having a free fall in market but China is having a free fall in economy. I think the best way is USA and China r nice to each other, so we can both survive through something that is coming. Sell stocks in any rebound. Good luck
971 2018-12-25 14:18:04 And may you short sell all your stocks..Ho Ho Ho. Merry Christmas, Roland. 
972 2018-12-25 14:16:55 @cspanwj Corporate tax rate drops 14% percentage points and stocks are a bust? I don't believe it.
973 2018-12-25 14:16:41 Don't worry, Obama will be back to taking credit for the economy in no time. Don't forget when stocks go down they create legions of interested buyers. Its not easy for someone to manipulate markets long term like you describe. There's much Trump can counter with.
974 2018-12-25 14:16:12 Volumes of all these stocks have spiked after a huge gap. Cineline has spiked but a red candle.
975 2018-12-25 14:15:02 PHILIPPINES! I PROMISE, YOUR SALES WILL GO HIGH, YOUR STOCKS WILL BE SOLD OUT, WE WILL MAKE YOU FREAKIN' RICHER THAN YOU'VE EVER BEEN!

The big crash is coming. Bankers know and start cashing out. Sell stocks! Buy gold and crypto! Merry Xmas and …
978 2018-12-25 14:14:16 TERRA PRIME GROUP stocks slump
979 2018-12-25 14:14:10 And my point was that that might not be obvious to everyone. You’re an educated MacArthur fellow. To some, they can only fathom that rich ppl have stocks. Yes, I think you could’ve said what you said without the condescending “really?” As if that’s a fact everyone knows.
980 2018-12-25 14:13:49 Stocks falling
Ire roaring
Its beginning to look a LOT LIKE a CORRECTION!
981 2018-12-25 14:12:02 I take it you don't have stocks.
982 2018-12-25 14:11:28 I hope Mnuchin doesn’t try going to the floor of the NYSE and buying stocks, but fear he might
983 2018-12-25 14:11:27 If you are saying that "you don't need to be rich to have stocks," then we agree. I think that is what NHJ was also pointing out too. The original person being quoted was doing stocks = rich, and it simply isn't true because so many people have their retirements in stocks.
984 2018-12-25 14:11:00 It's called a globally synchronized asset deflation; the corollary of globally synchronized inflation of asset prices caused by the collapse in interest rates. The new QE will now involve the purchase of stocks by Central Banks. Japan has been doing it & will doubtless continue.
985 2018-12-25 14:10:36 Merry Christmas! 2018 is a bad year for many investors. Traditional stocks, cryptos, 401K are ALL down. Hope 2019 will be much better.
986 2018-12-25 14:10:13 You should be thanking him because with the money that you receive as Christmas gifts this is a perfect opportunity to buy fortune 500 stocks at a lower cost. But… I’m sure you knew that
987 2018-12-25 14:09:53 I’m tryna get into stocks and invest ..
988 2018-12-25 14:08:03 You can’t be this naïve. This is the time you start buying stocks when the prices dip. I’m not talking about companies that you know are losers I’m talking about solid companies. If you don’t know the market goes up and down then… Never mind
989 2018-12-25 14:07:20 Stocks*
990 2018-12-25 14:07:18 I’m guessing it was deliberate to short sell some stocks.
991 2018-12-25 14:07:09 Trump, talking to a seven-year-old: Merry Christmas. Now would be a great time to expand your business. What did you get your employees? I heard your stocks are doing great. See you on the golf course.
992 2018-12-25 14:06:43 Everyone who isn't a market timer and has a broad portfolio composed of many stocks is down with the broader market. It will be interesting to see the overall performance with complete list. It will be more interesting to see when they start buying and what they buy.
993 2018-12-25 14:06:15 Stocks are on track for the worst December since the Great Depression
994 2018-12-25 14:05:45 If there's anything I've learned in 11 months of trading, it's that you cannot discount market action. When certain stocks are down 50% and $SPX is down 20%, you started trading at the start of a top. Need to learn to adapt because the market doesn't care about my inexperience.
995 2018-12-25 14:04:57 I've seen a lot of articles in Jamaica about stocks, but not much on mutual funds.
996 2018-12-25 14:04:51 Stocks go up and down, not agree with Fed is not declaring war on him and Mattis retired, was Not fired!!! They just like causing fear in America!!!
997 2018-12-25 14:04:26 Ok, tell me all of stocks you were invested in a year ago that actually gained in value as of 12/24/18.

@JeromeAdamsMD
1000 2018-12-25 14:03:32 I feel a bit asshole-ish about the downturn. I honestly feel sorry for those who are retired or retiring soon, but can't help thinking how cheaply my 403b is buying right now, and hoping in 5 years when I need it those stocks are sky-high. 
1001 2018-12-25 14:03:27 It’s like Black Friday for stocks.. :)
1002 2018-12-25 14:03:12 So? Over 50% of Americans own stocks. The other 50%'s economic well-being is also related to the performances of equities, in case you don't remember 2008-9. This hurts everyone. So it's a dumb take.
1003 2018-12-25 14:02:34 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression. Thank you Donnie.
1004 2018-12-25 14:02:07 Whatever you do, please tell her not to sell it! Market corrections are the worst time to sell stocks.
1005 2018-12-25 14:02:00 Stocks have fallen like skittles; but still the best stocks so far are: Nike, Microsoft, Visa, United health Group and the Pharmaceuticals Pfizer & Merck.
1006 2018-12-25 14:01:35 My stocks are pretty scared of a Pelosi lead Dem House and their promises.
1007 2018-12-25 13:59:59 Surgeon General owns Tobacco Stocks

1008 2018-12-25 13:58:53 Too bad the average Trump supporter doesn’t know what it means to sell short or hold any stocks. They don’t care.
1009 2018-12-25 13:56:49 Hahaha no he didn’t. He had to do that to dodge social media backlash, which in this day and age, is equivalent to being tossed in the stocks and hit with moldy fruit and veggies. All because sniveling Weasley fucks like you.

1016 2018-12-25 13:53:27 No, stocks just went on sale for the rich.  The people who need them for retirement are fucked, however.
1017 2018-12-25 13:53:03 In bull market too stocks look cheaply valued. But as the rally’s ebbs with time things seem expensive. But you realise after the damage is done.
1018 2018-12-25 13:52:40 Unemployment is over 22% & may be as high as 42%. When you remove the top earners & adjust for inflation wages on average are down. The majority of the tax cuts went to corporations (rich) & they used it to buy back their stocks they did not re-invest in workers & their companies

1027 2018-12-25 13:46:44 Trump wants instability. He wants his base to be full of fear so he can control them. Putin wants the market to crash. Have they been short-selling stocks? I think maybe so.

1030 2018-12-25 13:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 14 stocks Monday including $KKR, $HAL and  $NLY.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 30% in $KO where January 44.5 puts bought for $0.54 closed at $0.70.
1031 2018-12-25 13:44:27 Your daily reminder leftists ROOT for stocks to struggle to hurt Trump. They didn't say a word when stocks exploded. Stocks started to sink when Democrats won house & promised to destroy the man who produced the economic explosion leading to market surge. Well done Nancy.

1033 2018-12-25 13:43:57 With Christmas cheer eluding most  #investors, striking to see how far/how fast assets have moved.
Even as late as a few months ago, this configuration was thought by many as possible but highly unlikely:
Stocks in bear market territory, WTI oil below $43, 10 year UST under 2.74%
1034 2018-12-25 13:43:41 I think Chrom is good. But the only reason I would put him over some characters is the trading stocks stuff. Without that, I think Cloud and Roy are better.
1035 2018-12-25 13:43:34 Yes, and banning bump stocks, pulling troops from Syria, having a 4.2% GDP, hemp legalization, lowest black & Hispanic unemployment rates and the possibility of 12$ an hour min wage if the economy continues to thrive.
1036 2018-12-25 13:43:11 hahaha
1037 2018-12-25 13:43:08 US stocks had there worse Christmas Eve trade ever because of your sorry sad orange self. You are literally single handedly going to plunge the world into a recession!!
1038 2018-12-25 13:42:55 People waited till the market was up 300% to fully move to stocks and I am the stupid one?
1039 2018-12-25 13:41:47 Yes. The economy & stock market are based on confidence. A president with a firm hand on the tiller and a clear vision favors a growing economy & rising market (Clinton,Obama). Erratic policies favor recession & lower stocks (W, Trump).  We’ve seen what works & what doesn’t.

1044 2018-12-25 13:39:11 You obviously don’t have stocks or a 401k or will be missing a paycheck.
1045 2018-12-25 13:37:24 That’s it sold all crypto and just went al in to stocks.

1051 2018-12-25 13:32:57 T:his is the most logical answer to the stocks falling that I have read thus far.  
A must read.
1052 2018-12-25 13:32:54 I bought them last June from Forever 21 in Davao and I think they still have stocks. Maybe I could look for them (and probs any dnp related ones) the next time I visit there
1053 2018-12-25 13:31:11 The Dow fell 2.91%, the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines history. The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago. Last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, the Great Depression.
1054 2018-12-25 13:31:08 Your “ON” today @RampCapitalLLC  even though your stocks got battered. That’s the Christmas spirit. #FAANG

1057 2018-12-25 13:30:06 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures & when it drops below zero U don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. U know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same ~ Peter Lynch

1059 2018-12-25 13:28:05 Trump is a personality disordered man with dementia. I blame all the cowardly GOP who know and stay silent as they short stocks and grumble among themselves. Follow the money.
1060 2018-12-25 13:27:15 So a $1.5 trillion tax cut that was used to buy back $1 trillion in stocks and the stocks just lost $2 trillion in value means we just threw a trillion into the trash.  Who profited from buybacks when the stocks slumped?
1061 2018-12-25 13:26:29 In what other institution would you assume one of the leaders was acting on his own? Don't you normally try to see how his behavior promotes his institution's stated goals? I am not kidding, I think that they are spiking stocks to manipulate the Fed.
1062 2018-12-25 13:24:59 Anyone want to make a bet that Donald and his crime syndicate sold stocks short before they created the #TrumpSlump
1063 2018-12-25 13:24:43 My Never Trump friends celebrating as the Dow gets crushed. They believe it signals the end of @realDonaldTrump prez. Big mistake. His volatility is problematic & stocks r flashing worries abt the economy. BUT reversing corp earns wont happen overnight and thats all that matters
1064 2018-12-25 13:24:04 Children are spending Christmas in cages. Federal employees aren’t getting paid. Stocks are crashing. You are a modern day ebeneezer Scrooge. You should have written bah humbug cuz that’s what you truly mean.
1065 2018-12-25 13:21:02 According to reports "U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression."
1066 2018-12-25 13:20:53 How? Please expand.

And tell that to all Federal workers that won't get a paycheck and pensioners that have lost thousand of dollars in 2018, the worst December for stocks SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN 1929!

You, like the president are delusional, MAGA!
1067 2018-12-25 13:20:16 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression.
1068 2018-12-25 13:19:34 Yep, short selling is key to many. George Soros is making a lot of money betting on stocks to fail.

1071 2018-12-25 13:17:27 Time to buy stocks while they are low. Not worried still 20 years to go till retirement. Still have three Presidents to go till I start taking money out.
1072 2018-12-25 13:16:36 Correct. Plus the rich actually benefit from market drops like this. They have the cash to buy the stocks at lower numbers increasing their portfolios long term
1073 2018-12-25 13:15:20 Really?  Stocks have hit a 20-month low.  How long have you been in office?  Coincidence? Hmm?

1075 2018-12-25 13:13:41 The Stocks and Loans Crises was in ‘87. Regan de-regulating began in ‘81.

In 2000, De-Regulation was passed under Clinton - but Bush passed it in 2002.

Alan Greenspan would later reveal his regret in his role as treasurer when such occurred.
1076 2018-12-25 13:13:40 stocks rise by 1%.
1077 2018-12-25 13:12:33 I don’t think we need to replace Mnuchin or Powell. But Trump should add Cohn to the PPT to help them figure out the problem. I think we emergency lift Volcker rule & Reg FD. Put people back in the trading pits & on IBank trade desks. Let analysts value stocks vs quants. Jan 1!
1078 2018-12-25 13:11:08 The US is the strongest and most dynamic economy it's been in decades. You know nothing about stocks, bitcoin is a total scam.

1085 2018-12-25 13:05:27 The thing everyone seems to be missing is that stocks/bonds can produce cash income in the form of dividends /interest that isn't dependent on the fluctuating value of the underlying asset. If you plan for cash income rather than asset sales, market swings won't hurt you.
1086 2018-12-25 13:03:14 Well, it was certainly a good moment to short stocks with a wee bit of forewarning.
1087 2018-12-25 13:02:33 Dow Jones and Nasdaq sliding everyday 500-600 points? Where are we heading for? Political instability and trade issues making people jitter and converting stocks to Gold and Cash.
1088 2018-12-25 13:02:09 US tax cut steam has run out. Markets are correcting as expected. US debt is unsustainable. Trade wars and Govt shutdown amplify reality: US is broke. The big crash is coming. Bankers know and start cashing out. Sell stocks! Buy gold and crypto! Merry Xmas and Good Luck for 2019.

1098 2018-12-25 12:52:25 Actually Kamala a quick lesson on Americans in retirement...  they invest in fixed income instruments such as CDs, Notes & Bonds that pay monthly and quarterly interest, not volatile stocks.

1104 2018-12-25 12:48:11 3/ Or, just taking stocks as an indicator, are we at a point where the economy can't tolerate interest rates that are just fractions of what have been normal during upswings?  Is 3% the new 6%?
1105 2018-12-25 12:47:37 Actually Hillary won the popular vote. Trump acts like he has a mandate from the people but the majority didn't vote for him.

1108 2018-12-25 12:46:44 1. Non-rich people own stocks and have 401k plans as well.

2. This isn’t a zero-sum game. It’s not like the wealth is being transferred to more needy people, or being used to accomplish something else with social value. The wealth is just gone.
1109 2018-12-25 12:46:30 The economy is doing good, just look around more people are traveling & shopping, spending money.. it's a fact. Also stocks are up I know it dropped right before Christmas but as a whole & I guarantee it will go back up. What else are you blindly following that I can help with?

1119 2018-12-25 12:42:13 Not true.  The stock market is a reflection of the value of the businesses that are selling their stocks.  So based on the businesses performances or forecast their stock values go up and down.  Many different factors effect those forecast and values.
1120 2018-12-25 12:40:35 update if there will be stocks left*
1121 2018-12-25 12:40:25 And it's even more mouth watering that many stocks with great businesses are down well in excess of 20%. Even some that are recession proof / resistant.
1122 2018-12-25 12:39:08 So what?
#Stocks - visibly unconnected to the real economy, with that real economy largely of fast-food joints and other nil-wage jobs in recent years - are pure gambling.
Just an upscale version of Powerball.
1123 2018-12-25 12:37:55 It is exactly what the rich want.  This hurts mostly the average person saving for retirement with 401(k).  This gives the rich the chance to buy stocks back at a discount knowing the market will correct eventually while the average person sells off their holdings at a loss.

1126 2018-12-25 12:36:05 If I owned Hockeystick co. I would make a quick and decisive move into the market-making business. You will need a huge amount of upfront capital to pool stocks from private firms and sell them off to institutions. The stock exchange will make this feasible.

1128 2018-12-25 12:35:43 Yes it can but rises much more and much faster when stocks crater. It's a hedge against stocks, inflation immune.

1135 2018-12-25 12:31:34 I would think if that happens you will see a more extreme response but since the end of the world is already priced in, we'll see. I think what we have seen just shows how overvalued shale & Canadian E&P stocks actually were.
1136 2018-12-25 12:31:09 A 48-hour effort by Trump administration to soothe jittery financial markets did little to reverse the free fall in stocks Monday, as president’s renewed attack on the Fed & the specter of a prolonged government shutdown further rattled investors worried about a global slowdown.

This actually means to identify high quality companies whose stocks are trading at a lower price than should be.
1151 2018-12-25 12:19:36 Some of the worst things you could do is to base your investment decisions on what other people are doing. "Tepper has been nibbling on some stocks this morning." Yeah, maybe, but he might have shorted a bunch of others, or he might have a completely different investing horizon
1152 2018-12-25 12:19:31 FX rates would affect forward earnings for UK companies with operations abroad (positively if they're net exporters) and that would affect the price. Otherwise for GBP stocks in a GBP portfolio FX moves are meaningless.

1156 2018-12-25 12:19:18 They support banning bump stocks, when it was 18 USC §922(o) that banned civilian registry of machine guns which sowed the innovation for bump stocks. Legislation they never fought particularly hard over, because it made it a larger financial barrier to get a machine gun.
1157 2018-12-25 12:18:23 I thought when stocks go up its because of @BarackObama ?
1158 2018-12-25 12:16:56 Japanese stocks, other Asian markets down
1159 2018-12-25 12:16:52 Bette, wouldn't surprise me if he himself was saving money or profiting from this shutdown in one way or the other, Like in the stock market buying when stocks are low? Hiring contractors? There are so many ways for a conman criminal to line his pockets. Hence "shut down money"
1160 2018-12-25 12:16:47 . @realDonaldTrump how come when stocks were up you took all the credit but now that they tanked and I am broke you are talking about a wall?
1161 2018-12-25 12:16:40 Individual stocks are expensive and in any case advisers will take a big part of the earnings. 
Instead, index funds are inexpensive and aren’t tied to the success of one single company in particular.

Put all their savings into banana stocks. Can't retire.
1163 2018-12-25 12:15:52 "Right" also seems be a selective term on Twitter. My recollection is prediction of stocks with an impending, stunning, move higher, not 20%+ down. We are all wrong, sometimes. More credibility with a little humility...
1164 2018-12-25 12:10:57 But you cannot argue with evidence: index funds have grown about six times faster than those achieved by active funds managers who select stocks to buy.

1166 2018-12-25 12:09:56 He thought that a low-cost alternative was needed, so he proposed to set up a low-turnover fund that tracks the S&P index of stocks.
1167 2018-12-25 12:09:20 I am not cheering about the Downturn in Stocks, I am just not surprised that he Wrecked the Economy in under 24 months.  

Hillary Clinton would have done better.
1168 2018-12-25 12:07:09 No, but invested &/ tracking some of the above stocks, check my previous tweet, some randomly picked Low PE stocks delivered 30% CAGR, so this is just to compare with that portfolio returns.
1169 2018-12-25 12:05:36 Gold can rise along with stocks. 2016, for example.

1174 2018-12-25 11:59:11 @realDonaldTrump Fool. The Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. Stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far was in 1931.
1175 2018-12-25 11:58:34 Stock prices are low due to a fall in demand , this is evident of a lack of confidence. American stocks will remain low atleast till the election concludes . Therefore take advantage of low prices.
1176 2018-12-25 11:58:10 @GOP @FoxNews 
Donald listens to nobody and runs his rogue presidency by gut instincts and only guts.  But his guts stinks.  Consequences: US troops n allies still at war endangered by a Commander-in-Chief first to retreat.  He threatens the Fed Reserve n stocks dive.  Shutdown!
1177 2018-12-25 11:56:07 I trust that the scallops and tuna are from sustainable stocks like the milk... Have a good one, good 2018 review last night btw. Enjoy!
1178 2018-12-25 11:56:02 We are not recommending these stocks, just highlighting that these were the top gainers and losers in the entire listed universe. Nothing wrong about that
1179 2018-12-25 11:55:34 Now, that will be an epic. Must buy in enough stocks of popcorn.
1180 2018-12-25 11:55:30 Moron Trump claims the credit when stocks rise, blames everyone else when stocks fall. Hold on tight folks, the banks are about to crash and no one is going to bail them out this time around. #banks  @Ocasio2018
1181 2018-12-25 11:55:27 All the large institutions and rich people (the smart money) are dumping their stocks and taking their gains.
1182 2018-12-25 11:55:19 Thank you!  That whole sheet of @ANGELACHARDING wrapping paper is now used up, but I have further stocks of cool artist giftwrap sheets with my present stash!

1184 2018-12-25 11:54:38 Yes Bitcoin down from $19600 to 3100 with in year. US markets down almost 20% from all time high. Our market story is different, small and midcap stocks only down from high price that is jan 2018.but keep on running the index. Here retailer SIP amount misused to manipulate market
1185 2018-12-25 11:53:47 Ofc it is possible that BTC will go lower. But from traders/investors perspective BTC is down 80% which is more than good enough to start accumulating. Traditional markets are down only 20%. Wouldnt surprise me if money from stocks will flow into BTC now.

1187 2018-12-25 11:53:10 @AOTtrades The short interest on the FAANG stocks is very low - is this usual when the market is behaving like this?
1188 2018-12-25 11:52:41 I’m broke as hell and I have some important funds in stocks...
1189 2018-12-25 11:52:16 Monday saw the worst day of Christmas Eve trading EVER for US stocks. Remember to thank @realDonaldTrump for your present, America.
1190 2018-12-25 11:52:09 I got out of stocks recently - hoping to get back in to index funds at a much lower price in the future. I am not a trader - no shorts and no rapid ins and outs. Buy, hold, and very occasionally sell. Decided I do not like participating in bear markets.
1191 2018-12-25 11:51:27 Look @Savagestar3 yesterday porinju ws talking abt mid cap IT stocks....!! & I thk datamatics ws one of his picks it might gt butchered tomorrow just gng by his past reco history
1192 2018-12-25 11:49:19 I have never ever seen that move either, higher yields, higher cost of borrowing and higher for stocks? 
1193 2018-12-25 11:49:11 I’m surprised he isn’t telling them to buy stocks now because they’re a bargain like Steven Moore has been doing.
1194 2018-12-25 11:44:42 I wouldn’t be shocked if we find out that Trump, Mnunchin and crew shorted stocks yesterday. This smells fishy AF.
1195 2018-12-25 11:43:15 U.S. Stocks, Obama vs. @realDonaldTrump 
Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%
Trump (Inaugural 2017 to Dec. 24, 2018):  +3.9%
(S&P 500 data, not including dividends)
1196 2018-12-25 11:43:09 So @realDonaldTrump , why are you not tweeting about the success of your policies now? Quote: US stocks had their worst Christmas Eve on record. Unquote.
#presidunce #trump #potus #trumpresign
1197 2018-12-25 11:41:53 U.S. Stocks, Obama vs. @realDonaldTrump 
Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%
Trump (Inaugural 2017 to Dec. 24, 2018):  +3.9%
(S&P 500 data, not including dividends)
1198 2018-12-25 11:41:30 I wouldn’t be. It means we are having a liquidity issue and too few people own stocks to even care. Make no mistake this is a violent move. One that will take many months if not years to recover from.
1199 2018-12-25 11:38:23 Japanese stocks got hammered today! Some justified (eg. Softbank; Mercari) most underserved. Low volume, and pure momentum trading right now!. Keep in mind that Japanese stocks have a cap thanks to your friendly BoJ shareholder! #japanese #stockmarketcrash
1200 2018-12-25 11:36:44 utter nonsense - he is a self serving charlatan. After the best education money can buy he only achieved a 2nd in History - hardly a brilliant achievement. He wants to escape the tax clampdown and is shorting Sterling and UK stocks. No integrity at all
1201 2018-12-25 11:35:51 Out of hibernation to agree with Mohamed. Technicals are in charge. DCFs are set by 5-10 year money not 90D. And QT does not enter except as impact on rates or cashflows. But long rates are coming in and stocks are getting worse. These things are all excuses for a re-set.

1206 2018-12-25 11:31:25 I pulled most my stocks & etf's 3 months ago. I'll re-buy cheaper when it levels off. Did +45% in 2016 to 2018. On my worst i'm knocked down to ~20%. I still call it winning.

"Les deux boutiques duty free de l'actuel terminal sont entrain de liquider les stocks (-40 % pour ceux que ça intéresse), parce qu'ils sont entrain de s'installer dans le nouveau terminal."
1212 2018-12-25 11:26:46 I think im going to consider investing on arts especially Black Arts. They could be more valuable than shares and stocks that can fluctuate anyhow.
1213 2018-12-25 11:26:05 Nah, they're probably shorting the stocks most affected.
1214 2018-12-25 11:25:13 To be fair, you should compare the top crypto’s to the top stocks. Apple, Amazon, Google etc.
1215 2018-12-25 11:24:18 When there is blood on the streets.  I see alot of blood and panic so time to cherry pick some big stocks imo.

1218 2018-12-25 11:19:58 Down 28%, but  also was got into stocks in 2018. Learned my lessons. Decided to long, $AAPL
1219 2018-12-25 11:18:39 Good Call.  Isn't it amazing that he will blame anyone else for his mistakes, but the one thing that he is not primarily responsible for (decline in stocks)  he takes the most personal?
1220 2018-12-25 11:18:04 This is bad statistics. We should be told the numbers of stocks in each period represented. That would provide a basis to evaluate the information.
1221 2018-12-25 11:17:05 This ridiculous sanctity of the confessional is bullshit, for a start it's relatively new thing, sacrament whatever. Before that if you confessed for sins you were publicly admonished often in the stocks.
1222 2018-12-25 11:15:53 Yo the stocks are going DEOWN...
1223 2018-12-25 11:14:23 Which chart software do u use for global stocks?
1224 2018-12-25 11:12:06 Do you have a specific list of stocks which you check daily for levels or do you pick the stocks based on some scans?
1225 2018-12-25 11:11:59 Looks like the war & death industry is not happy that they are withdrawing from Syria I wonder if that's why the stock market is so down??? Weapons stocks take a dive stocks in GNE ??? makes me wonder.
1226 2018-12-25 11:11:16 And, of course the people selling would be encouraging everyone else to buy or hold stocks.
1227 2018-12-25 11:10:09 Buying Apple, Tesla and Nike stocks. Then being a little funny about this and buying Ice Cream, Vans and Coffee stocks. Oh and then equip myself with gear and NastyTrax!
1228 2018-12-25 11:09:27 What people don't seem to understand is that people are selling stocks.  Those people are GETTING money.  Nobody asks what those people are doing with the money they're GETTING.  Everyone acts as if everyone is losing money.  Seems like the most relevant question is never asked.
1229 2018-12-25 11:06:54 Playing to the base-Isn't that your expertise? Dreadful that we have to put up with you for 2 more years while you utterly  fail to do your job to provide oversight on the president.Stocks are way down, my taxes way up for 2018.Your budget approval led to SALT, a disaster for CD1
1230 2018-12-25 11:05:27 Ooohh ok. Yeah I was just talking about that lol. In my case, my mom was raised with money. Father played with stocks, owned property, let them stay home as long as they needed & let them come back if they needed. Cared for their kids while they finished college, etc.
1231 2018-12-25 10:58:53 The media all month has been plunging the market globally.Invest in American stocks...Idiots
1232 2018-12-25 10:58:15 US stocks indexes tumble last week after Fed's rate hike and shutdown of US government. Robust US economy aside, market chaos.
1233 2018-12-25 10:55:44 Um. Trump is shorting the stocks himself....on purpose.
1234 2018-12-25 10:50:09 It's not a great thing that 401k contributions have purchased stocks at inflated prices over the past coupla years, but a lot of this is folks buying into the notion that a Republican government is uniquely good for business.
1235 2018-12-25 10:49:22 In case any of you whiners want to know how get rich, NOW would be the time to buy stocks.
1236 2018-12-25 10:49:13 Who is this guy catch him and put him in the stocks
1237 2018-12-25 10:49:05 So you wanted to get into the billionaire’s boy club and they ask you to give them tax cuts and deregulation as entry fees. You did that. They “awarded” you with still not accepting you but with what they always do: rebuy stocks, close or move factories and invest elsewhere.

1240 2018-12-25 10:43:24 Yup, it’s a world economy. One economy affects the other. This only makes sense. I still say all this was planned so the rich can get even richer. Buy up abandoned stocks at low price, correction in market. Nobody knows what happened. Real high level crooks here. Using their laws
1241 2018-12-25 10:43:11 It's just paper loss. You don't lose unless you move your stocks when they are low.  And we are entering a recession in 2019.  Stocks will be down.

1255 2018-12-25 10:25:00 Hey Donny, US stocks had their worst Christmas Eve on record! The Dow Jones index of 30 leading companies fell more than 650 points on Monday,  and is on track for its worst December since 1931, during the Great  Depression. #MAGA my arse you Shouty Orange Buffoon.
1256 2018-12-25 10:24:42 I just had a Rose call me a "class traitor" and block me ... when I noted the apparent contradiction of owning stocks AND cheering the falling market. 

It's gonna be a good Xmas.
1257 2018-12-25 10:24:27 stocks is a long term thing for me, I bought more last week and will buy more this week, mostly high yielding US stocks, the lower they go, the better but from history after sharp corrections you have massive rallies too, question is where is the floor in stocks right now
1258 2018-12-25 10:23:54 Running up to Christmas Day the US stocks greet us with a big slide.. $ still looks strong against £ and US investors are coming to London.. watch this space.. big announcement soon on Insta: @daniel_daggers #us #stocks #ChristmasDay2018 #dollar #sterling #realestate
1259 2018-12-25 10:23:30 I agree, those that wanted out of the smaller stocks were gone 2-3 weeks ago. The market squeeze lower over the last 5 trading days presents a decent bounce opportunity for spec stocks with dried up volumes honouring support levels on the chart. Decent ST news flow is a must...

Within  5 mins of the final bell crypto tanked followed by Asia tanking.   Coincidence? No.  Been following stocks for 20 years this happens everytime

1266 2018-12-25 10:17:44 In the meantime, sir, something needs to get resolved. Americans are watching our stocks crash, and 401k's go down the toilet. We REALLY care about this as well.

1270 2018-12-25 10:14:02 To blame crash on fedrates alone is finacial malpractice. If ya follow stocks you'd see everytime Trump mentioned tarrifs the next day or within hours djia loses 2-5% that day and beyond.

1311 2018-12-25 09:26:27 If you mean “economic progress” the resolution of problems  arising from Trump’s tariff wars, fraying of alliances, and irresponsible tax cuts, the answer is no. Expect slowing growth,  rising inflation and a bear market in stocks.

1314 2018-12-25 09:25:24 While the market has been down 20% from the high, Warren Buffett is still doing the same thing - reading and thinking. Probably bought some shares.

The market is there to serve you, not to instruct you.

Be like Buffett.

Buy stocks like you buy groceries. Buy more on sale.

1326 2018-12-25 09:12:44 If political parties are traded in exchanges,

BJP - Multibagger. Stay long.
CONG - Technically looking weak. Further downside expected. Stay short.
AAP - Penny stock. No fundamentals. Don't trade.
CPI/CPM - Penny stocks. Will be delisted soon. No volume.
1327 2018-12-25 09:12:24 I start to accumulate or distribute stocks in an aggressive way.
I don't play by the rules.
If I am bearish about the market I would go to 100% cash, and vice versa.
right now 15% cash.
1328 2018-12-25 09:11:14 Now that Trump’s antics are having a negative effect on their stocks, Republicans are starting to see him in a new light.

1330 2018-12-25 09:10:15 I have index funds, so technically yes but it’s fine. Basically all the progress stocks made in 2018 have been down to 0 in the last few months and especially the last few weeks

1335 2018-12-25 09:06:56 walls work, ask Israel. This is what they are afraid of. If a wall gets built and substantially cuts down on illegals Trump wins again especially going into 2020.

1339 2018-12-25 09:03:57 The Dow jones has had its worst december since 1931!
The Nikkei closed down 5%!
US stocks have had their worst Christmas eve on record!
The Shanghai composite fell more than 2% today!
1340 2018-12-25 09:03:56 "time & size yet to be set". 
It doesn't really matter, u take each day as it comes but i would watch 10k on nifty before becoming bearish. I'm still looking for longs (individual stocks) above 10500.
1341 2018-12-25 09:01:41 This makes sense if you expect to take the money out soon. But if you leave $20K in gold or cash in a bank for 30 years so you can retire, it's basically half gone when you come back, assuming ~2% inflation. Whereas stocks, they're probably 3X higher even if there was a crash.
1342 2018-12-25 09:01:11 Interesting next few weeks in the US. Stocks falling, troops being sent home, wall going up, FED is being ripped apart and now showing its true colours, Trumps tweets, Gov may shutdown and more

1347 2018-12-25 08:58:19 Unfortunately Nasdaq tech stocks taking a beating was not ideal.  Always get some flight to quality during uncertainty.
1348 2018-12-25 08:58:14 so when the Economy was strong in 2017 it was trump’s doing. But when stocks fall in 2018 its Obama’s fault. Stop being so blind. This is all trump’s doing. It’s those pesky tariffs and everything he’s done to create uncertainty in the markets.
1349 2018-12-25 08:57:39 US stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. Really?!!
1350 2018-12-25 08:56:21 ‘Oh we’ve double bottomed and will pump into new year cause stocks are plummeting and cash will flow into crypto’....

FFS.... remember 6 months ago when they crucified those that said we’d see 2k.

Bottom is around $1800 +- 10% 

Ignore the noise.

1361 2018-12-25 08:49:40 Other than the fact of the normality of stocks going up and down. The federal reserve have the most control of the market. If a president doesn’t cooperate. They make the economy look bad so they look bad. The feds cause chaos more than any president!
1362 2018-12-25 08:47:40 Actually my stocks are fine. I also own a small manufacturing business that is thriving. Many of us small businesses are hiring more, growing and increasing wages.

1364 2018-12-25 08:45:57 Wow! You were really right, Mr. President!  Oh, wait.  Now that all your Billionaire Buddies are done buying stocks with your tax cuts that did nothing for the middle class, the "real" economy is going to show up.  We will be in a full recession by the end of 2019.  Thank you!

1385 2018-12-25 08:24:18 Stock market = voting on the future. Stocks are supposed to be the present value of the expected future value of the companies. So if something happens, they vote based on how they think the future value will be impacted.

Frankly, emotion now plays too big a role, in the vote.
1386 2018-12-25 08:24:02 Most android users are not ashamed though. I think the company needs the check from this brand recognition aspect, Twitters stocks have fallen because of the ongoing sexual harassment cases.

1402 2018-12-25 08:05:30 BAD TECHNICALS Or SET? @elerianm
Today’s relatively heavy trading (& selling: Dow is down almost 500 pts) —on what historically has been a traditionally light volume session- is yet another indication of the bad technicals that are currently gripping stocks in the US & beyond.
1403 2018-12-25 08:05:27 The December market rout is because the Democrats won, and they'll reimpose job-killing regulations + Fed raising rates which lowers the incentive to park money in stocks.
1404 2018-12-25 08:05:20 RT@ jessefelder: RT sentimentrader: 73% of S&P 500 financial stocks hit a 52-week low this morning. That exceeds all days from the worldwide financial crisis.

Since 1990, the only days to exceed today's reading were Sept 24 & 27, 1990.
1405 2018-12-25 08:04:51 The stock market is a CASINO; but the banksters and financiers paid a lot of graft money to have it exempted from gambling regulations. ALL stocks, are paper wealth not backed by anything but what people will give you for it in the future = eventually worthless like all fiat.

1407 2018-12-25 08:04:09 And that's what the Fed wanted. Folks to move their $ from stocks to bonds. Bonds are profitable to the Fed Masters, until they decide to switch it up again.
1408 2018-12-25 08:03:43 RT WestWingReport: U.S. Stocks, Obama vs. realDonaldTrump 
Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%

In January, he shared excitement over a “big day” on Wall Street. By June, the president was tweeting: “Stock Market up almost 40% since t…

1415 2018-12-25 08:01:42 Index wise not as worse as 2008 but ask any portfolio manager he would cry if holding onto the likes of yesbank, pcj, infibeam, dhfl, lic, tamo , psu stocks, etc

1418 2018-12-25 07:56:59 You are dead wrong. In a Roth you pay tax up front, then never pay tax on any gains or dividends over the course of the funds lifetime... Also you can take out what you have put in, with no penalty or tax. There is also plenty of evidence stocks are worth more now than 30 yrs ago
1419 2018-12-25 07:56:47 If @realDonaldTrump makes one penny on cheap stocks, it could be illegal market manipulation of the highest order. I fear there may be a more nefarious reason for the market free fall. This has his business model all over it. #TrumpCrash #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown #ArtOfTheDeal
1420 2018-12-25 07:54:51 I just invested all of my Christmas money into stocks.

BJP - Multibagger. Stay long.
CONGRESS - Technically looking weak. Further downside expected. Stay short.
AAP - Penny stock. No fundamentals. Don't trade.
CPI/CPM - Penny stocks. Will be delisted soon. No volume.

1426 2018-12-25 07:45:08 Can't turn back the clock.  Everyone has a taste for travel, luxury goods, gold, real estate, stocks, coffee, Italian wine and kpop.  No going back now.

1432 2018-12-25 07:36:09 I'll win a bunch of games with a character and get a lot of GSP to get close to Elite Smash then the game pairs me with the laggiest kids or a kid who has two stocks on and I inevitably lose because that's my luck online with this game lmao.

I just need two more characters.
1433 2018-12-25 07:36:07 80% stable. Probably the best trade I made all year in any portfolio was moving my 401k from 0% to 50% cash in early Nov. Bought back 100% stocks at the relative low of $spy 263 and sold to 70% cash at the 280 high. So the 401k is only down 6% during this entire slide
1434 2018-12-25 07:34:35 Chinese stocks have reversed after being down -2,5%. Yuan is also up. I think Chinese has realised that they have just won the trade war. At least they have not lost.
1435 2018-12-25 07:34:21 Think about it for a minute: if we see the next economic crisis and banks will only move 15-20% value into crypto to hedge their losses in stocks this will be huge for crypto.
1436 2018-12-25 07:33:39 Switch this around and there'd be a lot of chaotic households, completely lost men...and every restaurant that delivers would have it's stocks triple overnight.
1437 2018-12-25 07:32:33 115k here and building by $8,000/month!! Slowly contributing every month to stocks though.
1438 2018-12-25 07:31:46 I thought the Trinity study was over 50% stocks for a 30 year retirement (& the rest in bonds). There's no easy answer when bonds were returning <2% for over a decade.
1439 2018-12-25 07:30:44 Or...you could be like my husband's trump-loving, fox-viewing co-worker, who actually had no idea that stocks had dropped so dramatically, as he bragged about his portfolio. Upon being informed, his only response was "Oh".  
1440 2018-12-25 07:29:25 While this is part of investing I find this downturn somehow tilting. We have a president willing to bankrupt the country to pump stocks, which is horrible as it is. But then stocks go down anyway largely because he is a total moron. Now we have more debt and less wealth.
1441 2018-12-25 07:28:49 Oooh interesting. So theres nothing actually with the stock market other than uncertainty? If thats the case, Ill buy all stocks under the sun and wait for them to go back up! Already made$1500 from getting MCD stock in 2011

1459 2018-12-25 07:16:14 Fed rates have little to do with it. That only effects those making free money invested in treasury notes. It may also contribute to a rise in common stocks due to reinvestment from those bonds. Every time Trump mentions tarrifs or shut down or a staffer flees it plunges. F-me-$

1463 2018-12-25 07:14:48 In early 2017 I sent email to SEC about what looked like Trump doing “pump-n-dump” with stocks. They emailed back, unconcerned.
1464 2018-12-25 07:13:16 None available. All stocks was bought by @MYANC cadres and tenderpreneurs.
1465 2018-12-25 07:11:20 Funny how Trump is to blame when stocks are down and Obama gets credit when they’re up. 
1466 2018-12-25 07:11:09 Our proprietary models pick stocks with long-term potential. If a stock is part of a smallcase for this quarter, it's possible that it may be removed in the next quarter if it doesn't fit the theme. The idea is to stay invested in the theme/strategy for the long term.
1467 2018-12-25 07:10:20 Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the White House,
Not a creature was stirring, only the Twitter mouse!
The stocks hung but soon fell down without care,
In hopes that the government shutdown soon would not be there;
Melania was nestled at Mar-a lago in her bed;

1482 2018-12-25 07:02:03 "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau." - Irving Fisher, Professor of Economics, Yale University, 1929.
1483 2018-12-25 06:59:35 It’s essentially 100% psychological in my opinion. Long bull market where stocks are trading at premiums and all the chaos of Brexit and trade wars and stuff is real. But the market panic is pretty much pure human emotion.

1508 2018-12-25 06:41:53 @realDonaldTrump . Stocks are also on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression.
1509 2018-12-25 06:41:33 "Consider how the Trumpistas have responded to falling stocks. So far these are just a minor economic bobble"
1510 2018-12-25 06:41:22 The US abandoned commodity money a while back in favor of fiat currency, which is fake money. Stocks are also fake money. The economy is a huge fucking lie.

1528 2018-12-25 06:30:56 You do know you don’t have to invest 401k only in stocks ?
1529 2018-12-25 06:30:45 Salute to the Captain!  Been with you for 3 plus years and one of the greatest stocks in the market. I think when you go to $20, you should meet us at West Point, conduct a meeting, give us a tour and party!
1530 2018-12-25 06:28:01 High PE stocks will go through a price and time correction. We have seen in the past when value emerges in other quality stocks with lower PE ratios and similar growth potential, investors flock to those counters.
1531 2018-12-25 06:27:50 The fact is, our stocks will take a hit but we aren’t boomers so with a better president we think they will rebound in time for us to use them when we need them.  We’re lucky that way. But still, fuck trumpsters.
1532 2018-12-25 06:26:40 just look at the great deals on all these stocks,,, a real christmas miracle!!
1533 2018-12-25 06:26:37 "They can force you" always mystical "they are trying take away your________" fill in blank. Get mad,get angry at "them" meanwhile , dont pay attn to billions in tax cuts to super-wealthy,  bad healthcare provisions up for removing,crashings stocks,terrible military decisions.
1534 2018-12-25 06:25:13 Well after reading for bio n you retweeting Candy O nuff said! Wages for some of us have not gone up, or tax cuts didn't trickle down! Hope for stocks don't tumble too far down!
1535 2018-12-25 06:24:51 U want stocks to improve?  Want government working at full capacity?  Want mueller and the Russian probe to go away. Want Trump Enterprises and it’s properties to be worth something in 6 mos?  Resign......now. If u don’t, u will not have a penny to your name, Melania will leave
1536 2018-12-25 06:24:49 TWN Stocks:  Actually, both Grand Pacific Petrochem (1312 國喬) and Taiwan Styrene Momomer (1310 台苯) are overpriced - considering where pricing for styrene is heading.   Expect a dramatic decline in both companies' 4Q sales and earnings.
1537 2018-12-25 06:24:28 I never check mine because I just assume it's accruing money but after seeing markets and stocks dropping thanks to 45 I decided to check it and now I'm so bummed out
1538 2018-12-25 06:24:08 He is right though. Nearly impossible to go buy stocks if you are on fin twit.
1539 2018-12-25 06:23:07 Which are top 3 stocks you recommend now
1540 2018-12-25 06:22:15 US Markets rallied backed by Tech Stocks (famously FAANG Stocks)... 

Valuations streched to very uncomfortable Zone...
1541 2018-12-25 06:21:33 Well how is your Christmas, looks like mine is #marginal looking at the stocks today.
1542 2018-12-25 06:20:09 I hope no one asked for stocks this #Christmas.
1543 2018-12-25 06:19:54 Happy Hodldays! #cryptocurrency $BTC #stocks
1544 2018-12-25 06:19:50 Oh brother  To be retired and heavily reliant on stocks for income would be a special kind of idiot. Retirees are more likely (unless they’ve put in some real effort to go against stable financial workings) to be invested in less aggressive portfolios.
1545 2018-12-25 06:19:35 Head over to Myntra and grab the best trendiest styles before they run out of stocks #MyntraEORSSaleFinale
1546 2018-12-25 06:19:31 I'm honestly not against @realDonaldTrump  I'm just going to Pray fOr u. #Millennials #vOte my stocks and 401k looking sad. But I know it's not his fault. It's the damn fed. They want Americans poor and struggling. Thanks @federalreserve  for putting big banks and 1% ahead
1547 2018-12-25 06:19:28 The stocks fell when the dems took back the house
1548 2018-12-25 06:18:37 Women are better than men at picking stocks for trading.
1549 2018-12-25 06:18:05 It should also go without saying that no one should invest funds they can’t afford to lose in the stock market. Also, public pension plans shouldn’t pretend stocks are a free lunch.
1550 2018-12-25 06:17:37 Feeling awesome about 401k realizing the midterms could wreak havoc pulled out of all stocks oct 15  and feeling lucky now . Advice we are no where near bottom get out of market before mueller findings and STOP using Facebook merry Christmas
1551 2018-12-25 06:16:54 Tokyo stocks plunge in Christmas rout amid fears over US economy
1552 2018-12-25 06:16:46 Asia stocks sink after Wall Street's Christmas Eve plunge
1553 2018-12-25 06:16:46 I would wait with the stocks and sell real estate. Precious metals 30%. Diamonds, land, forest etc.
1554 2018-12-25 06:14:42 False, they have been shorting the stocks since the October peak.  This loss is on all passive investors; 401Ks, pension funds, etc.
1555 2018-12-25 06:13:50 The market behavior has more to do with rising interest rates, and the fact that he called the CEOs of the biggest banks asking if they had enough cash to withstand a run. Stocks are a terrible metric for political success.
1556 2018-12-25 06:12:07 Tokyo stocks plunge in Christmas rout amid fears over US economy | guardian
1557 2018-12-25 06:10:48 Does anyone know if there’s s normal trend for selling stocks this time of year for tax purposes, to fund college, etc? Seems like a lot of selling. Don’t sell me short.
1558 2018-12-25 06:10:23 I have more capital in stocks than I would like this is happening faster than I was predicting but have to trade on facts and try and recover best I can
1559 2018-12-25 06:10:00 I've noticed something about the Stock Market.

When Republicans control the House, stocks go up.

And when Democrats control the House, stocks go down.

It makes no difference who the president is, just who runs the House.
1560 2018-12-25 06:09:49 I'm not bummed in the least about the Dow or the Markets; like the vast majority of people in the USA I have virtually nothing invested in Stocks. Sure, your 401K might be affected some, but not really that much. That said, rich-people are getting hit hard. I hope they like it!
1561 2018-12-25 06:09:45 I don’t know a *ton* about stocks but I recommend waiting it out for a year. Stocks will always fluctuate with the market but with any regression there’s (usually) a bounce back
1562 2018-12-25 06:09:14 I'm going to be buying a ton of stocks wed or th afternoon.  Plan to make a good living off scared money
1563 2018-12-25 06:08:58 What is this Stocks game
1564 2018-12-25 06:08:37 @realDonaldTrump "Stocks continued marching toward their largest December declines since the 1930s" printed in the subscription growing NYT.  Ouch. Anyone 5 years from retirement has suddenly left your base. MAGA?
1565 2018-12-25 06:07:49 Do the elite deep state globalists have the ability to pull the rip cord on tech stocks?? Wouldn't that effect their portfolios??
1566 2018-12-25 06:07:06 Ok that is going too far. The main reason that stocks retreated now is feds interest hike. You are not entitled to your facts; that works both ways.
1567 2018-12-25 06:06:54 I say stocks are tanking due to democrats taking the house so get over it
1568 2018-12-25 06:06:15 $GME $BBBY
Retail Sales November 1 thru December 19th rose 5.2% YOY. 
Stocks are on sale. I still see potential strategic play happening with $GME.
Continue to collect dividends while we wait on these.
1569 2018-12-25 06:05:55 1 of 2: I have a pet peeve -when writers can't write - "The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression."
1570 2018-12-25 06:05:38 I lost money trying entries at the beginning as I tried to short some stocks that went crazy. Eg WTC, COH, REA. This dented my confidence to follow through on some further tries. Even worse was trying to go long after missing some moves on short side. Overall a great experience.
1571 2018-12-25 06:05:33 Or our market is being cyber-attacked by enemies who manipulate buying and selling stocks electronically based on algorithms.

1581 2018-12-25 05:57:56 MY STOCKS
1582 2018-12-25 05:57:56 I am no financial wiz, trust me. But 9 months ago I got ALL of my 401k out of stocks and put it totally in bonds and cash. I am still positive for the year. Anyone who didnt see trump doing this to the market is nuts! Everything he touches dies.
1583 2018-12-25 05:57:40 Let’s assume a 10yr timeframe.  GMO says stocks to return avge -3% est.  Bonds risk missteps by CB’s & inflation.  Gold more a ‘safety trade’.  Bitcoin a gamble.  Real estate risks deflation after run up.  Best option: small, successful privately held businesses
1584 2018-12-25 05:55:16 The 1% hold most of the stocks so they're getting a bit miffed.
1585 2018-12-25 05:54:16 Make America worse again. Stocks drop because of Government shut down. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
1586 2018-12-25 05:53:48 “Ha! Stocks are in a bear market! Our time has arrived!!!!”

Chumps on Twitter whose YadaYadaCoin positions are down 85% on the year.
1587 2018-12-25 05:53:05 What if portfolio is full of stocks lik suzlon ..etc
1588 2018-12-25 05:53:04 @davidhogg111 just want to congratulate you on your acceptance to Harvard and the ban of bump stocks. I’m lucky to live in Canada with better gun control. To me personally I have no problem with owning ar 15s but in Canada you need to get a license and daily background checks.
1589 2018-12-25 05:52:50 The Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. The slump came after  the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession last time the market fell so far in Dec was in1931, the Great Depression.
1590 2018-12-25 05:52:18 Loads of union CBAs have been negotiated in recent years to give unionized workers DC-style plans, often alongside DB plans.

The most common default investment option today is target date funds, and large-cap stocks like S&P are heavily featured in target date funds.
1591 2018-12-25 05:51:00 Tech stocks are driving some of the craziness right now, the censorship is irritating the hell out of those of us who had jobs all the while O was in office, I don't understand corporation that is traded publically purposely ticking off their clients.
1592 2018-12-25 05:50:41 Stocks
1593 2018-12-25 05:49:45 Got so tired of reading his tweets bragging how stocks were up because of "HIM".  Where's all his tweets now that its tanked??  
1594 2018-12-25 05:47:46 So r u pointing that corrections in GE stocks r buying opportunities
1595 2018-12-25 05:47:12 But if you consider the many "rebounds" I'm sure that the losses of the value of the stocks to investors have been much worse than 10%.
1596 2018-12-25 05:46:56 Top 10% of Americans own 81% of all stocks
Second 10% own 11% of all stocks
The bottom 80% own 8%
Non-rich people have very little stock, so mocking the losses of the rich, who have created historical levels of income inequality, should be fine.
1597 2018-12-25 05:46:05 What they see is libs like soros and multiple CEOs selling all their stocks manipulating the market. It’s the one place that @realDonaldTrump was succeeding. They had to take that away. All buying gold to tank markets... they should go to jail for #manipulation
1598 2018-12-25 05:45:46 Ownership means everything... If the business isn't owned by the Gov't, than it isn't on the same level as the gov't... The rules of publicly traded stocks reference ownership thru private business transactions... only If the Gov't owned 50%+ of company, should gov't rules apply.
1599 2018-12-25 05:45:45 Really? What has he actually done? 410k down stocks down ? What has he accomplished? Nothing that’s what.
1600 2018-12-25 05:45:13 Stocks wld be fine if Fed wld not manipulate them w/easy money shenanigans. Stocks & oil down b/c Fed is RIGHTLY unwinding Obama-era Quantitative Easing - Fed lets bonds it bought mature, w/o replacing. Destroying credit at $60B/mo pace (-3.5% GDP/yr). Must be done.
1601 2018-12-25 05:44:51 Hey guys so I've heard about the twitter drama... lot's of people have been saying that I probably ended smash4 the most skilled. I mean I took 18 stocks in 3 doubles matches! And outplayed people with finesse. The rumours seems pretty spot on! Merry christmas, from DoctorAinuss
1602 2018-12-25 05:44:49 5 months from November. Going right into spring, n summer when stocks slow down.
1603 2018-12-25 05:44:04 2/2 went from the financial crisis the last GOP president left us with, to unemployment below 5%. Now we're in a trade war, stocks are crashing again, & Trump just ballooned the deficit w/ a huge tax cut for him and his rich friends. The gap between working class & 1% ballooning
1604 2018-12-25 05:42:09 My stocks are so low

Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%
Trump (Inaugural 2017 to Dec. 24, 2018):  +3.9%
(S&P 500 data, not including dividends)
1609 2018-12-25 05:36:50 There are a few resistances which were broken and were never retested as supports. Let's hope for our parents that stocks start mooning again.
1610 2018-12-25 05:36:09 For my birthday I want stocks. 
1611 2018-12-25 05:35:59 $vktx $mdgl just scratching my head how oversold these stocks can get
1612 2018-12-25 05:35:22 Hey numbnuts, the smart rich people have a lot of $ sitting in their accounts ready to buy stocks when the bottom is in. Working class people won’t be able to do the same. Stop resenting successful people, it exposes your envy & stupidity

Thank you for standing strong in the face of the hideous propaganda being leveled against you since before 2016 by people bent on destroying our way of life  !!!Americans have your back -get stocks back on track & BUILD THE WALL!!
1616 2018-12-25 05:33:04 Way better phones out there, this ones a rip off @649$. Makes you wonder why Apple stocks have tanked.
1617 2018-12-25 05:32:36 It’s true keep your portfolio as is for now until bottoms out buy some them watch them all grow back and surpass ... will always happen over and over ... welcome to stocks for us all AGAIN...

1622 2018-12-25 05:29:05 I said s/t last year about what Trump would do to the economy, & a coworker said, “My 401K has never been better!” “Just wait,” I warned. I moved mine into more bonds in Feb. Took it totally out of stocks last week.
1623 2018-12-25 05:27:05 @mitchellvii JUST WHAT TRUMP SAID WOULD HAPPEN . HE WAS TOTALLY RIGHT AGAIN . TRUMP SAID AT HIS RALLIES IF THE DEMS TAKE THE HOUSE YOUR STOCKS WILL GO DOWN DOWN DOWN AND SURE ENOUGH STOCKS GOING DOWN DOWN DOWN . WHAT A BUNCH OF LOSERS 
1624 2018-12-25 05:26:24 The year started with President Donald Trump promising big growth for stocks.
1625 2018-12-25 05:26:12 Pay 5 billion for a wall so people can make a buck on stocks. Gee, that sounds intelligent. I bet you voted for trump too

1627 2018-12-25 05:25:08 Market? Isn’t it crashing under your leadership? This is your  Market. The talk is Tariffs kicking our butts! We don’t have a strong dollar when stocks crash,right? You said you owned this shutdown. Dems don’t have the votes to shut down,just like Kavenaugh..Dems didn’t want him.
1628 2018-12-25 05:24:56 I am curious if they're doing an ANIT-QE where they stopped buying stocks to prop up the market but are instead dumping them to depress the market.  Just sayin...
1629 2018-12-25 05:23:05 Faith restored that 10x more say stocks
1630 2018-12-25 05:22:55 @stevenmnuchin1 when all is said and done, this crew of crooks have been shorting stocks all month. In any con game don’t follow the players, follow the money

1634 2018-12-25 05:22:09 Meanwhile millions of employees are buying stocks every payday adding to 401K's while their wealth is syphoned off to these a-holes.

1639 2018-12-25 05:20:34 Oh. I didn't know. On what platform does one trade Nigerian stocks?I mean, for day trading. I know of trading the forex market on MT5/MT4. Merry Christmas
1640 2018-12-25 05:20:20 I moved my 401K balance into a less stock-heavy fund in February, after Taxscam took effect. Still lost almost every $ my employer contributed this year. It’s so ugly now, I moved everything out of stocks last week - til Trump’s gone. At least my contributions won’t be lost.
1641 2018-12-25 05:20:02 When can we bring back public stocks to shame these people? 24 hours will do.
1642 2018-12-25 05:19:44 What will you do to save the markets, sir?  Your recklessness has cost investors billions, tens of billions.  And it's only going to get worse until you resign.  If you see this and own stocks, SELL!
1643 2018-12-25 05:18:29 Marijuana stocks have shown both great opportunities for investors and great volatility risks. Are you invested in marijuana? Is the industry guaranteed to succeed.
1644 2018-12-25 05:18:15 I read up on this fund months ago. It uses AI to comb through old financial statements to pick stocks and produce laughable results.

1648 2018-12-25 05:16:34 Stocks are live people.
1649 2018-12-25 05:14:50 The bulk of those "suffering" from the stock market drop are the 10% of the population that owns 90% of the stocks. The ones really suffering are the remaining 10% with retirement/pensions invested, but their account managers collect flat fees and will be fine.
1650 2018-12-25 05:14:45 Good I can get stocks cheaper, you are stupid.

1652 2018-12-25 05:14:13 Renault might want to buy more stocks of Nissan. It's getting cheaper now.
1653 2018-12-25 05:13:46 I just heard the market is down another 650.  More to come.  This is  very serious.  If you own stocks, SELL!  Only a resignation will stop this madness.

1655 2018-12-25 05:13:02 Dig this: who needs a huge infusion of cash to pay multiple sets of lawyers for 17 investigations? And who's in a position to not only short his holdings, but also to manipulate the markets so that those stocks go down?
1656 2018-12-25 05:12:18 Bump stocks make a firearm less accurate. Just another example of liberals to make it illegal to own a firearm that is a right.
1657 2018-12-25 05:12:00 Wow you can’t even get one thing right?!?! Everyday do you just go through and think “how much could I possibly fuck up in one day?!?!”Cut to: stocks plummeting, federal employees not getting paid, little girl crushed...
1658 2018-12-25 05:10:31 It has been productive though I’ve been up reviewing stocks I want to buy when the stock market reopens after Xmas.
1659 2018-12-25 05:09:52 It depends on your timeframe. I bought physical gold in late 90s at $265-$335 range. It’s had a better return thus far than stocks.
1660 2018-12-25 05:09:20 christmas is a time for depreciation of stocks and good investment opportunities
1661 2018-12-25 05:09:06 Put it into stocks. Make that money dawgg
1662 2018-12-25 05:06:19 more so, a lot of every day people have money in stocks. retirement accounts etc. wealth is not a zero sum game
1663 2018-12-25 05:04:54 This is a great time if the year to have invested stocks into knife manufacturing plants
1664 2018-12-25 05:04:45 Shutdowns Are Stocks Crashing? Deepening Bear Market Could Miss CFP Semifinal
1665 2018-12-25 05:02:52 Mine probably does. haven't looked at it since I set it up. I was thinking about bonds vs stocks generally. I've always thought of bonds as not having much upside
1666 2018-12-25 05:02:36 Yeah. Broke the previous low on March. You mean that US stocks will also drop as will open?
1667 2018-12-25 05:00:22 Great stocks would be like Amazon, walmart, Google ... u wanna try get long term stocks... and when u build up on your stocks you can sell them and make even more money than what you originally invested
1668 2018-12-25 04:59:39 Hey man, I'm in $100k in student loan debt. What do I need to do to get on this? I'm trying to buy some stocks because this is gonna pop - everyone is laughing but I see what you doing out here!

1675 2018-12-25 04:53:54 Most non-rich people own no stocks. They are, however, at great risk that this will trigger a recession. Then again, if no recession happens during this presidential term, there’s an even greater risk for this country’s (and world’s) future.

1680 2018-12-25 04:51:56 The alternatives to stocks include cash, bonds, precious metals, real estate and other stuff of value. But damn, I will be back in the stock market... in a bit.
1681 2018-12-25 04:51:39 Also, when prices go down, investment accounts buy more shares. Then prices go back up, the same accounts are worth more than before. Ups and downs are good. The people who DGAF are the 50% of America that owns ZERO stocks.
1682 2018-12-25 04:50:38 Isn't it true Donald that you lowered the EPA standard for our US clean drinking water not two weeks ago by so now more chemicals more lead sulfer etc u buy stocks before like in Brita or trump water itta safer
1683 2018-12-25 04:49:16 So now we're blaming the victims, are we? 
I'm retired depend on dividend-bearing stocks for income. 
What would you have me do? 
Buy bonds? Interest rates are at record lows. 
Gold? Diamonds? Stuff my cash into a mattress?

1686 2018-12-25 04:48:02 I GOT BONDS NOT STOCKS BITCH THATS HOW YOU SAVE AND WHEN I CROSS THE STREET I LOOK BOTH FUCKIN WAYS
1687 2018-12-25 04:47:55 Yes, lost our house, both bankrupt. My stupid bankruptcy lawyer bitched at me for not having stocks.
1688 2018-12-25 04:47:41 You must be the 1% who has benefited from that jackass...  because everyone else is getting royally screwed. Hope you don't own stocks
1689 2018-12-25 04:46:32 That’s the thing I don’t understand like how to read the stocks.
1690 2018-12-25 04:46:23 #GOLD - Today's higher high was negatively divergent on both the RSI and MACD Histogram. Its MACD Line is at its highest level since Feb 2018 "before stocks rallied". Are we about to see a repeat performance?
Gold closed at 1272, 50% Fib of 1360-1184 closing, 1293-1300 above.
1691 2018-12-25 04:45:36 i wasnt talking about me, though i have been thinking about interest rates and stocks
1692 2018-12-25 04:45:36 Ian, you’re the one making fruit salad.  Rachel’s point is that some Americans sold their moral souls for a fatter 401k. Now that Trump has knocked 20% off stocks, she’s wondering how they feel about their deal with the devil.  Legit question.

We have the lowest unemployment ever highest minority homeownership! The stocks are reacting to the fed bad decisions and the obstruct dem party!  Stfu
1699 2018-12-25 04:42:41 Thanks for tweeting. Makes me feel better as I am looking at stocks and playing video games with my son. Merry Christmas
1700 2018-12-25 04:42:37 I am losing my value of the IRA I started 18 years ago. As a retired person, are your stocks affected? Why do you think stocks are falling?
1701 2018-12-25 04:42:27 If you own stocks, SELL!  Only a resignation will save us.

1703 2018-12-25 04:41:19 I have hit that point in life where getting panties and stocks are seriously so great.
1704 2018-12-25 04:40:05 Is learning about investing in stocks hard? Cause I wanna do it.
1705 2018-12-25 04:39:59 Bearish on what?

Bitcoin seems to have bottomed.
Fiat has been printed to infinity.
Stocks have been propped up.

The moment of truth is upon us.
1706 2018-12-25 04:39:52 It's only going to be worse.  The stock markets just had the worst month since the great depression.  More losses are to come.  Only the presidents resignation can save us.  If you own stocks, SELL.
1707 2018-12-25 04:39:33 Or today with flailing  401k (stock DOW loss) I hate that it excited me to see failure today especially because we invest in real estate not stocks anymore...

 Isn't he embarrassing? fucking with people's whole lives by market? He sticks to real estate ...smart

Advisors
1708 2018-12-25 04:38:53 So, algo trading is the reason the market is down so much? Wouldn’t that mean there are inefficiencies being created which astute investors could benefit from?  At some point if stocks are at artificially low prices because of indiscriminate selling, buyers will exploit that.
1709 2018-12-25 04:38:21 You just need to educate Americans to think about “how much I’m saving “ by buying stocks when they are on sale. But stocks aren’t even 50% off yet. As if ‘full retail’ wasn’t a joke..
1710 2018-12-25 04:37:11 Depends on whether the CAD goes down against the USD faster than Gold. Oil may be about to bounce and therefore CAD too. Gold could run into trouble here at $1272 resistance or slightly higher at 1293, especially if/when stocks rally.
1711 2018-12-25 04:36:38 Or banning bump stocks
1712 2018-12-25 04:35:32 Nope, out of it DD sl hit .
1713 2018-12-25 04:34:42 Stocks is probably more sideways for a bit...
1714 2018-12-25 04:34:05 So...Delusional Donnie, worst year for stocks in a decade according to the numbers on the DOW.   Tell you what, just have Hannity, Limbaugh and Ingram (TSA is non-essential-get rid of it) say the market is at an all time high.  40% of Americans will believe it.

1716 2018-12-25 04:33:37 No.  They should cut production.  On stocks everyone is saying bounce.  Which means either they don’t or they do and bounce way harder then most expect.
1717 2018-12-25 04:33:30 But what Steve Dennis said was a fact. This was the worst year for stocks since 2008. Whether poor stock market performance spills over to the rest of the economy remains to be seen.
1718 2018-12-25 04:32:18 On stocks I am looking more like a bounce.. On oil it is silly as Opec is going to get more aggressive. Those guys cannot survive with Brent at 50 handle.
1719 2018-12-25 04:31:45 Please also spare a thought for the poor. While we stress about the xmas menu, the VIP's that will visit and the stocks in the bar fridge, the poor have another kind of stress .. putting food on the table.
1720 2018-12-25 04:30:33  India's Whole Economy is just $ 2.5 trillion  and this week global stocks are down by $ 3 trillion.
1721 2018-12-25 04:29:03 What simple down home people don’t get is that trump and his cronies know exactly what they are doing. They put their stocks into bonds or other fool proof investments. Then trump causes a crisis stock plumets then buy low and make millions.
1722 2018-12-25 04:28:25 Maybe it’s an opportunity.  There are many stocks at 5-6x earnings and some companies below their tangible book value now.  There is blood in the streets and some of it is mine.
1723 2018-12-25 04:28:11 And that will result in diluting conviction, we share complete strategy and one back test it with 24years on data all by himself & it's first of its kind. Invest with conviction and confidence after reading as many signals as one like on all 3500 stocks (listed and unlisted)
1724 2018-12-25 04:28:04 Yes, this is the beauty of corrections for the wealthy;
can take advantage of them.
Stocks are at very attractive prices,
It's not genius but means.
1725 2018-12-25 04:27:55 And plummeting stocks due to no trust in the president.
1726 2018-12-25 04:27:54 I strongly believe that the #stockmarketcrash is to sift out the weakest so that everyone would sell off... Then stocks can be purchased at their lowest prices by those who know the details & hang in! Making the rich richer! #PoliticsToday #NewsAlert
1727 2018-12-25 04:27:30 Maybe, but the fact that stocks are plummeting during Xmas when everyone’s spending $ and after stock buybacks which artificially boost up stock is not a good sign. But only time will tell...

1730 2018-12-25 04:26:07 @realDonaldTrump I have $30k in stocks that are worth $14k. Tariffs bad for economy. Government shutdown bad for economy. Mnuchin saying banks have enough $ if there is a bank emergency bad for economy. Having a moron as president bad for economy.

1733 2018-12-25 04:24:40 finally had a breakthrough with my dad and rap but it was only because i compared playlist curation to the selection of the stocks that make up a mutual fund, i feel unclean

1735 2018-12-25 04:23:47 how about them stocks huh
1736 2018-12-25 04:23:04 That’s exactly what they’re doing! They’re all having a very merry Christmas shorting stocks. Making money hand over fist!
1737 2018-12-25 04:22:30 Stocks!!
1738 2018-12-25 04:21:40 He should be - when 490/500 SPY stocks are down today and 495 of them are making 52-week lows every day.  Bears are on full throttle.
1739 2018-12-25 04:20:43 1/2 1st 2 yrs of the Obama presidency the @HouseDemocrats & @SenateDems controlled each house. They passed the ACA-1 of the most significant social advancements since Soc Sec, & we began the recovery leading to nearly 300% gains in stocks.
1740 2018-12-25 04:20:14 Put it in stocks
1741 2018-12-25 04:20:08 I'm of the mind that if you sell stocks to the public that puts the company on the same level as the government and must follow all anti-discrimination rules they do.
1742 2018-12-25 04:19:05 Once again, the world can be at ease that you know best, better than    all the experts. Lol. But what happened to that investment genius who was claiming responsibility for the incredible rise in the stock market earlier? Now that stocks are way down, it's someone else's fault.
1743 2018-12-25 04:18:39 Then you're in luck: you're buying cheap stocks

1745 2018-12-25 04:17:56 This is  hun, reporting on behalf of  Fox with your local business news. The Politics Haters are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  RL stocks. Thank you for tuning into  Fox.
1746 2018-12-25 04:17:31 Alan Greenspan is married to Andrea Mitchell. Yes, that Andrea Mitchell who works for NBC and MSNBC. The Federal Reserve is raising rates for one reason and one reason only and that is to take down @POTUS. And to buy cheap stocks. Gotta make that money.
1747 2018-12-25 04:16:07 Stocks would be fine if they didn't worry about the Fed raising rates to slow the economy down.  Have no idea why they did it.
1748 2018-12-25 04:16:05 Stocks maybe dropped too much. Some bull space in there by end of Q1
1749 2018-12-25 04:15:25 BS, Powell knows exactly what he is doing. QE is done. Stocks will have to perform "on their own" as in a real economy. This time 2019 S&P = 3000
1750 2018-12-25 04:15:23 The #TrumpBubble that brought gains to US stocks and the $ is collapsing. The more the stocks fall, the more will investor sentiments worsen, and there'll be more people who'll need to sell. In Tokyo today at mid-day, the Nikkei225 fell 5.1 percent to 19,147.45. Panic selling.

1759 2018-12-25 04:13:07 Really sucks that the @RobinhoodApp caps you at only $500 in referral stocks. I’d love to refer a ton more people to it but they cap me so not much reason to promote it.
1760 2018-12-25 04:13:04 I think DSI for stocks has been very low for days and we went from 2500 in SPX Friday morning to 2342 today. Hard to use that as an indicator now. Althought in theory we should bounce a bit.
1761 2018-12-25 04:12:53 The “rich” don’t get hurt when stocks dip bruh you’re literally rooting against Dorris who’s planing on retiring next year and has her money in the markets
1762 2018-12-25 04:12:32 Ok bot. What work have they done for us? Stocks are plummeting, he’s the most corrupt president we’ve ever had in the history of this country. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?? Stupidity is NOT an excuse!
1763 2018-12-25 04:11:20 I work in the nitty gritty of the financials markets and study market structure every day. It is always hilarious to me when we get a huge rally or sell off how all of these random people become experts.... ohhh my 401k. Chill out Jesus Christ. #StockMarket #stocks #markets
1764 2018-12-25 04:10:58 Hey Grant what gold stocks do you recommend?
1765 2018-12-25 04:10:37 Hello po, yes po but limited stocks nlng po.
1766 2018-12-25 04:10:06 The economy doing so good and rising interest rates is what's causing the drop in the market. People are selling their more volatile stocks for bonds. You can thank whoever you want for the growth, whether Obama or Trump or both, or neither, but this is normal in a good econ.

1769 2018-12-25 04:07:29 On November 7th when I read that Republicans won all 3 branches I immediatly went into Recession mode. Pay down debts and stay out of new. Preditor crap everywhere now, stocks crashing, and now massive investigations of trump and GOP is nothing new to me.
1770 2018-12-25 04:07:05 Stocks go up, stocks go down. You can make money either way, figure it out and stop crying
1771 2018-12-25 04:05:04 Great and since you only spent 6% of your current border budget and stocks are crashing you don't need any more money for a wall.#TrumpResign
1772 2018-12-25 04:04:58 I had said this earlier today. This feels like the 87 crash over 1-2 months.   The moves in high quality stocks is wild.$SPY $DJI
1773 2018-12-25 04:04:41 Yeah, my 401k is crushed and I’m pretty sure layoffs are coming due to plunging company stocks. Bad tweet.
1774 2018-12-25 04:04:10 Not to worry Doug Stocks are in the process of getting destroyed. The markets will decline until the fed says uncle and does a Radical 180. they will cut super fast, and resume QE to infinity. Better own #Bitcoin cause baby its gonna pump.
1775 2018-12-25 04:03:50 Puta lesson learned from last year's Christmas, wag agad iwaldas in the remaining days of December! Sa January na iwaldas para matino stocks sa mga stores para may sense yung mabibili ahahaha
1776 2018-12-25 04:03:34 Good thing for you that you're not allowed to buy any stocks eh pardna?
1777 2018-12-25 04:02:12 I'm not. Just being honest. Not convinced that Gold is going much higher "yet" per the article I shared. Looks to me like we're going to get a small bounce in stocks soon, then a positively divergent lower low, then a rip your face off rally. Higher yields too. Higher DXY? Gold?
1778 2018-12-25 04:02:05 Stocks were up because the rich we're so loaded with cash from his tax reform they bought all the stocks up so it inflated the mkt now it will come back to were it needs to be , let's not even talk about the recycling business where China was our number one buyer!
1779 2018-12-25 04:01:44 As a side note, I personally employ negative quality/momentum screens as well as looking at multiple value metrics and technicals (I.e. I like to see value stocks close to 52w lows). It helps, but I still end up owning "traps" every year. Just part of the game...
1780 2018-12-25 04:01:27 When people figure out that the entire economy of the last 10 years has a total foundation of quantitative easing, artificially low interest rates, and the asset bubbles in stocks & real estate, gold will soar and dollar will fall. I have said before, buy and hold gold and silver
1781 2018-12-25 04:00:09 Ouch I hope you all already sold your stocks and wait for good bounce. I already sold all my stocks and wait
1782 2018-12-25 04:00:05 Sell-signal detected for 55 stocks: $ZTS $MSI $FISV $CTXS $PGR $AXP $MCO $FMC $NVDA $DAL $VNO $NFLX $KSU $TRIP $BSX $FLIR $WMT $ROP ...
1783 2018-12-25 04:00:05 Buy-signal detected for 6 stocks: $CRM $CLX $FE $YUM $INTC $BAX
1784 2018-12-25 03:59:33 I don't have stocks bc lol I can't afford that but some people headed for retirement do. If it just affected rich people it'd be dope.
1785 2018-12-25 03:59:06 The moment the common man firmly *believes* the price of stocks he holds will *never* fall it is time to start taking money off the table. 

This is better than any technical or fundamental indicator.
1786 2018-12-25 03:56:56 Get rid of Donald or we will not have a country left. Stocks will be used as toilet paper.
1787 2018-12-25 03:56:34 Posting smug shit like “it’s not a downturn, it’s stocks on sale” as my nephews rapidly unfollow me
1788 2018-12-25 03:56:22 Bonds..stocks...whichever. Still villains.
1789 2018-12-25 03:56:20 Of course 

Hopefully the LINE store stocks them...
1790 2018-12-25 03:56:12 A reaction to Dems taking the house. Everyone is taking money out of stocks to protect their cash.
1791 2018-12-25 03:55:28 Cash is King right Now! In Crypto and Stocks.....merry Xmas
1792 2018-12-25 03:54:34 Donald Trump only thinks those 6 & under believe in Santa. Christmas for trump has been everyday since he was born. He belongs in WWE, not the Oval Office. #trump #Christmas #norad #Dow #Stocks #PoorTrump
1793 2018-12-25 03:54:30 If we are facing an 80% decline in the market I would put every dollar I make for the next few years back into stocks. 

Talk about buying low!!


1794 2018-12-25 03:52:37 Why am I so inconsistent with Ultimate jeez. Sometimes I can win with 3 stocks intact, but other times I just lose 10 times in a row lol
1795 2018-12-25 03:51:53 What does it mean when GDP increases but stocks drop. Also, are companies part of GDP? A company is itself a product produced by VCs, investors, etc.
1796 2018-12-25 03:51:30 Can you make life easy for me (and profitable my investors) and just go ahead and send me a list of those stocks?
1797 2018-12-25 03:51:11 Morgan Stanley etc have been recommending Asian, Indian stocks last month or so, not sure on what basis, Asian gov/corp debt levels super high. #India investors looking at oil price miss the coming export collapse,liquidity erosion, higher credit costs and startup funding melt.
1798 2018-12-25 03:50:29 2)Trading crypto’s is different that stocks, you can trade in 1 week what would take you years in stocks. It’s a golden goose and it’s not just going to disappear after having it’s greatest year, cake for any good trader.
1799 2018-12-25 03:49:02 And don’t forget that, even before the recent market dip, overall, stocks did better under Obama.
1800 2018-12-25 03:48:21 Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market.

The S&P 500, also near a bear market, is down 19.8% 
#TrumpsDecliningEconomy #TrumpShutDown
1801 2018-12-25 03:47:14 I own no stocks.
1802 2018-12-25 03:47:09 is that the BOJ selling stocks?
1803 2018-12-25 03:46:33 Stocks on sale.   Dividend yields increasing.
1804 2018-12-25 03:46:26 It is already chaos. Just like the stocks. Worst in 87 yrs here at Christmas. People lost so  much money it’s not even funny.
1805 2018-12-25 03:46:01 Hey O’Leary. I bought small cap stocks on your recommendation 1 year ago. How am I doing?
1806 2018-12-25 03:45:11 Stocks are experiencing their worst decline since the financial crisis a decade ago -- and #RealDumblDonald is blaming the guy he appointed to the Fed. 

Won't #RealDumblDonald  ever take responsibility?
1807 2018-12-25 03:43:53 I actually moved from cash to stocks in my retirement account on Friday :)
1808 2018-12-25 03:43:46 Except that the wealthy don’t need the money and it’s largely on paper. 

And the wealthy aren’t the only ones in stocks. Where do you think all those middle class teachers, government workers pension funds and 401Ks are kept?

1810 2018-12-25 03:43:20 Tip: if your family mentions Trump positively say “I’m not the one whose stocks have fallen” and enjoy the bit of silence
1811 2018-12-25 03:43:00 Stocks are correcting due to factors other than 45. Read an economics book and educate yourself.  Merry Christmas btw.
1812 2018-12-25 03:42:40 Can someone play devils advocate? E.g stocks needed to come down to rise again.
1813 2018-12-25 03:42:38 He's probably at the white house cause all his rich friends at Mara Lago are pissed their stocks are tanking.
1814 2018-12-25 03:42:32 If they can make the illegal case that bump stocks = machine guns, then it is easy to make all semiautomatic rifles machine guns, as it does not require a "device" to bump a semiautomatic rifle. Slipperiest slope of all!
1815 2018-12-25 03:42:30 TWN Stocks: Grand Pacific Petrochem (1312 國喬) is far superior than Taiwan Styrene Momomer (1310 台苯).   ALWAYS better.   So there's no way that its stock price is $3 lower.  So if you're in Taiwan Styrene Monomer (1310 台苯), it's time.   It's time to get the fuck outta there.

#TrumpsDecliningEconomy #TrumpShutDown
1817 2018-12-25 03:41:23 It has a lot more to do with the GOP tax cuts which are characteristically regressive. They were essentially a windfall for the rich who sold overpriced stocks back to the companies until prices sank which reduced the value of the average workers 401k stocks.
1818 2018-12-25 03:41:14 Stocks are experiencing their worst decline since the financial crisis a decade ago amid worries about, among other things, a slowing of corporate profits and the impact of a trade war on global growth.

Tired of winning?
1819 2018-12-25 03:40:34 Take it from a retired guy, stocks are volatile but in the long run have paid off the best. Do some reading. Life's lessons are generally not intuitive.
1820 2018-12-25 03:40:03 Trump needs someone to publicly blame for the stock market. He prob  forced Mnuchin to call the banks and ask about liquidity which was an idiot, naive move that caused stocks to drop even further. Buffoon.
1821 2018-12-25 03:40:03 In other words stocks is on sale! If you don’t own apple now is a perfect time to buy up cheap shares on sales
1822 2018-12-25 03:39:43 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1823 2018-12-25 03:39:03 I just got some stocks that’s were like $.60, $.90, $2 so on and so forth
1824 2018-12-25 03:39:03 Stocks, 401(k)s, IRAs aren’t only for the very rich. Regular working people have these investments, too. Even those on the left.
1825 2018-12-25 03:38:13 Looking back, the tax bill did help the stock market for a time. Also helped that we had a "business-friendly" president. It's worth remembering, though, that most Americans /do not hold stocks/ and that most did not see their wages increase significantly, which is what matters.
1826 2018-12-25 03:37:52 Try penny stocks. They can score but just gotta research

Try Think link
1827 2018-12-25 03:37:38 “The correlation between stocks and bond yields has been positive for the better part of the past 20 years,” Bloomberg  equity strategists Martin  wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Each flip to a negative correlation (2006-07, 2013-14) preceded a significant equity-market correction.”
1828 2018-12-25 03:37:25 Stand your ground Mr Trump. The decline in the stock market is a bear trap. The market might decline into the 19000 area and is a great time to load up on stocks. What you are doing for America sets a stage for the DJI to rise to 41000 area over the next few years.
1829 2018-12-25 03:36:32 I can make way more money trading stock options than crypto though haha. So....I'd take stocks right now.
1830 2018-12-25 03:35:06 Stocks plunge following U.S Tresuary Secy's call to bankers!tyhttps://youtu.be/5UVEQ2Uq20c
1831 2018-12-25 03:33:43 It’s Black Friday for stocks
1832 2018-12-25 03:33:06 @realDonaldTrump 

THEY WILL CRASH THE DOLLAR.

THE CHART IS PROGRAMMED to collapse like all the stocks were b4 it
1833 2018-12-25 03:32:58 It's amazing that just knowing the Democrats won the house the stock market comes crashing down. @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer #STOCKS #markets
1834 2018-12-25 03:31:06 Well, VIX is at 36 now...if we get a climax whoosh down it might happen this week.  Dow 20,000 and SPX 2,200 possible, but I'm not betting on it.  If it happens it won't happen with me holding puts, but rather ready to short VIX  and buy stocks on a move into the 40-50 range.
1835 2018-12-25 03:29:01 guess which cousin asked his trump voting relatives how their stocks were doing today?
1836 2018-12-25 03:28:59 Not true.  Billions and Billions of dollars lost in pension monies and stocks due to stock market crash You created by shutting down government over a temper tantrum.  Not to mention almost a million government employees are out of work.  Not making jobs, your taking jobs away...
1837 2018-12-25 03:28:57 Sad day for stocks.
1838 2018-12-25 03:28:37 Yeah I don’t know much. I joined that robinhood app and just did some little research and did some penny/cheap stocks to start off. Plus they gave me a Snapchat stock so that was cool.
1839 2018-12-25 03:28:25 Investors pulled money out of stocks to buy presents. Big deal.
1840 2018-12-25 03:27:36 #RT @shaunking: RT @StevenTDennis: The last time stocks had a worse year than this one was 2008. 

2008 was not a good year.
1841 2018-12-25 03:27:19 @realDonaldTrump yes you should fire Jerome Powell, this has been the worst years in history for the stocks to@fall and we aren’t even@in a war per se
1842 2018-12-25 03:27:02 should i make a own twitter for shoppy updates and stocks ? #fortnite
1843 2018-12-25 03:27:00 Next year, I wanna see Queen J personally and wanna have all her published books which is, I think, almost impossible bcs I'm lacking of money, time, and stocks hahahahah k
1844 2018-12-25 03:26:00 4/ be but I base my long-term optimism for stocks both on the history of the market but also the history of business, as owning shares is simply owning part of a business. I think the odds favor me doing well over the long-term, and thus advice investors to *not* try things like
1845 2018-12-25 03:25:45 via Mott: teacher's pet, ain't one yet, better forget it, check your stocks and shares.
1846 2018-12-25 03:25:23 Whoever laid tht abomination in the stocks gents wants namin, shamin, n shootin
1847 2018-12-25 03:25:02 It'll be time to buy stocks, won't it?
1848 2018-12-25 03:23:57 stock market is entirely fabricated worth and reactionary stocks are worth as much as people make them so if everyone just stays chill so does it why can't we all just be chill all the time and never have to worry about some ridiculous concept thats already screwed us over before
1849 2018-12-25 03:23:02 Hi,
The participant wise OI report on NSE gives OI data of FIIs for index/stocks long call/ put, index short Call/ put and index/ stocks future Long / short.  I have been seeing this data for a month. .....................when FIIs net sell future or index their OI should reduce
1850 2018-12-25 03:22:32 @trickmitch1 Thanks for the great morning of trading Pat. My trading has really come together as of late. It goes to show with hard work, the right mentor, and learning to trade the right stocks, I can do this. Merry Christmas to you and the family. " IS IT Wednesday YET".......
1851 2018-12-25 03:22:31 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
1852 2018-12-25 03:22:22 As well as the in the bottom 20 stocks djt companies own 10 of them.
1853 2018-12-25 03:22:08 Everyone owns stocks. It's a major correction. Also, the fed had zero interest rates for years.
They had to change. The best time is now since the economy is 
Very strong.
1854 2018-12-25 03:21:14 Maybe they own stocks. We know they don’t care about the country, but they might care about their pocketbooks.
1855 2018-12-25 03:20:53 2/ stocks was a crazy idea. All of these are predicated on the belief that you can successfully time the stock market, and most of them are usually very wrong. But I've also always said that if you have a short horizon or low tolerance for drawdowns, then the stock market isn't
1856 2018-12-25 03:20:35 Looks like bears celebrated Christmas last night. DOW down 700 points. Gap down opening very likely. Have to factor in potential short-covering, long unwinding or rollovers with technicals for the next 2 days. good stocks picking crucial. anyways tomorrow shd b an interesting day
1857 2018-12-25 03:19:59 Just moved from 60/40 to 80/20 stocks bonds.
1858 2018-12-25 03:19:48 I have a 15% stop/loss rule off of peak after original buy. Sold most of my stocks, most at gain but off peak, some at small loss. 45% cash, 35% high quality munis now.
1859 2018-12-25 03:19:33 @NewYorkStockEx   The past 2 weeks is the perfect reason to restore the uptic rule for shorting stocks !  The computer algorithms did in 2 weeks what took 1 year to build! @realDonaldTrump
1860 2018-12-25 03:19:11 1/Perhaps your risk tolerance isn't right for owning any stocks Robert. 

I have long said that attempts to time the market are destined to fail. People *also* said as early as 2011 that the stock market was going to decline by 50% or more. People also said in 2009 that buying
1861 2018-12-25 03:18:57 Also if companies buy there stocks back.(which they are). They destroy them .. Market might seem like its losing cash but the stocks are getting stronger and companies more powerful to pay employee wages. This is natural. Just my opinion of how i see the markets.
1862 2018-12-25 03:18:53 Think after Xmas sale on Stocks :-)
1863 2018-12-25 03:18:42 Time to buy stocks and make a bundle. Things are looking up!
1864 2018-12-25 03:18:37 It is simplistic thinking or plain and simple asinine thinking to cheer things like this. I know a lot of people who don’t own stocks who lost everything in 2008.
1865 2018-12-25 03:17:45 Is there any chance that Uday, Qusay and Dot are shorting stocks, because Daddy has an app that can tank the market?
1866 2018-12-25 03:17:45 Insanity....
Japan 10yr @ 0.05%. 
The way markets makers blackmailing central banks by hammering stocks it's seems like "SIZEABLE" bailout coming. An as always market makers will win. #bulls #Bears #faang
1867 2018-12-25 03:17:01 Of course it's speculation but does make sense for $BTC, $GOLD, and $SLV to take charge soon to save investments.

Still in early stages for the stocks where it may go or how long it may last. But definitely people like us will watch it to protect ourselves.
1868 2018-12-25 03:15:00 Exactly. He’s too cool, calm, and collected. He must work in stocks and acquisitions.
1869 2018-12-25 03:14:38 Stocks are currently on sale for those with the means to profit by this manufactured non-crisis.
1870 2018-12-25 03:14:19 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1871 2018-12-25 03:13:38 apple stocks rise by 10%.
1872 2018-12-25 03:13:15 16 times Obama said no boots on the ground, now dems upset they’re coming home. 
Even @CBP agents want the wall. I’ve been to the border. A wall is needed.
Fed is to blame for stocks falling. Raised rates once in 8 years during last admin. Have raised them 4 times in last 2 years
1873 2018-12-25 03:13:14 Stocks are on sale!
1874 2018-12-25 03:11:49 Only 10 out of stocks?

Truly a miracle
1875 2018-12-25 03:11:46 So, the day starts w/ Trump sending stocks into even worse downward spiral, and ends w/ Trump questioning existence of Santa. Worst president - worst human being - ever - in history.
1876 2018-12-25 03:10:09 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1877 2018-12-25 03:09:40 Too trusting. The end result is sabotage is sabotage. The use of a US gov plane for personal use (again) is a tell that they wanted to be found out. They are "Shorting" stocks. These are literal villains and this is a literal heist.
1878 2018-12-25 03:08:50 Stocks plummeting means one thing, perfect time to buy
1879 2018-12-25 03:08:40 Haha, I don't even own any stocks. Take THAT, you dumb fucking richies!
1880 2018-12-25 03:08:09 He's ruined my stocks. 3/4 of my money is gone. I'll never see it and my dreams of retirement travel is also gone. #FuckTrump
1881 2018-12-25 03:07:24 Here’s how:
“If you’re a net buyer of stocks, as most investors are, you WANT prices to be low.  Who goes into a store hoping prices have gone up?”
“If you’re a net seller at this stage, sell more slowly, if you can.  My condolences.”
1882 2018-12-25 03:06:09 This is true, and you can selectively draw from retirement 401ks so that you can draw from bond investments in the low times and draw from stocks later on. Gotta be smart with your withdrawal schedule
1883 2018-12-25 03:05:28 Discount stocks for my kids’ 529s, just under the wire for tax time — but man, that 401k balance stings more than a little.
1884 2018-12-25 03:05:25 I see a good conclusion to effects of stock market drop.....people sell there stocks it goes down trump fixes market, we invest when it sells. Then hold on to them for years. But sell half when it rises. Market will balance.
1885 2018-12-25 03:03:25 If you got cash on the sidelines in my opinion now is the time to BUY just not social media stocks.
1886 2018-12-25 03:03:09 In the category of things I did not expect to see, "haha bonds not stocks scrub" coming from SOCIALISTS was pretty damn high.
1887 2018-12-25 03:02:55 How can you say they are growth stocks ? They are already operating at 95% capacity. Future expansion is difficult due to environmental concerns.
1888 2018-12-25 03:02:24 “because at seven it’s marginal, right?”

< stocks fall another 7000 points />
1889 2018-12-25 03:01:34 Some interesting moves on the 2021 LEAPS... interesting opportunities opening up in certain stocks.. the premium to pay to play is skewed..
1890 2018-12-25 03:01:34 @realDonaldTrump You better have a good reason long term for banning bump stocks....
1891 2018-12-25 03:01:01 As a former stock broker this is the best time to buy some stocks. Like Home Depot.
1892 2018-12-25 03:00:06 BOXING DAY SALE! 
(26th December)

20-50% off selected accessories

While stocks last!
1893 2018-12-25 02:59:30 Why do they want to unload stocks, because they know a lot of people who over leveraged themselves in the market are going to start selling in mass.  If you want to look at bad companies check their balance sheets from 2010 to 2018. If their debt to something ratio is bad then 
1894 2018-12-25 02:59:23 Well stock investors sell and go into gold or some other metal. They fear buying at high price and now have to sell at a low price. Compunded is the debt margin, that is they bought stocks at just 10% of it's price. Now that full price debt is due. They don't have the money.
1895 2018-12-25 02:59:16 Stocks in the news: Infosys, Tata Sponge, Petronet LNG, Jet Airways and RIL
1896 2018-12-25 02:58:41 Dump stocks — buy Bitcoin
1897 2018-12-25 02:57:08 i think we'll see some signs of relief late this month/ early next month... but by May... seriously sluggish bear... including tech stocks like apple even... im guessing 7 year bear?
1898 2018-12-25 02:56:57 This is such an Ike Turner moment.This guy takes your tax dollars to build a useless wall, he tanks your stocks, literally robbing you of your hard earned money and you still call him a ‘real man’.  Obviously you’ve never looked in the mirror and seen what a ‘real man’ looks like
1899 2018-12-25 02:56:51 Donald tweets out soon asking people to stop selling stocks
1900 2018-12-25 02:56:31 @Steven1_994 HI I was wondering if you could dm me a good broker and software for trading stocks.
1901 2018-12-25 02:54:49 Let us not forget that this may well be another money grubbing tactic for his wealthy donors. He runs his mouth, causes a #TrumpShutdown, Stock Market tanks, we loose our 401(k)s and the rich swoop in & buy stocks at super low prices. None of them can be trusted. #RichGetRicher
1902 2018-12-25 02:54:46 The biggest problem for big Corps and banks is how they can unload their stocks without triggering the market and also pay back the money they borrowed at low interest rates while remaining solvent or liquid enough to continue business operations. Oh yeah add the QT on top.
1903 2018-12-25 02:54:12 You do realize the economic downfall happened in 2008 under Bush? He also tripled the stock value, cut the unemployment in half, and saved the economy from a 2nd Great Recession. Trump’s trade policies have caused the stocks to free fall
1904 2018-12-25 02:53:34 “Stocks went too high, you are ruining lives!”

“Stocks are reacting to the Fed increasing rates, you are to blame for the decrease!!”
1905 2018-12-25 02:52:52 Today, stocks had the worst decline since the 2008 financial crisis, Merry Christmas Eve...
1906 2018-12-25 02:52:36 Stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression.  MAGA!!!!
1907 2018-12-25 02:51:43 Maybe if the dems would work with him instead of doing everything in their power to defeat him. Everything he has done has been done for the good of  Americans. Stocks go up and they go down
1908 2018-12-25 02:51:36 2 STOCKS ALLY
1909 2018-12-25 02:51:12 Stocks initially fell following a statement on Sunday from Treasury Secretary #StevenMnuchin that he had checked on the health of the country's largest banks
1910 2018-12-25 02:50:52 Ok quick questions if the fed int. rates are so low who benefits?  Better yet if I told you you could borrow money(billions)  at 0-1% how much would you borrow?  Oh yea and stocks are rising to new highs every year.
1911 2018-12-25 02:50:01 "Stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression."  Winning!!!!
1912 2018-12-25 02:49:50 Bro that’s free stocks for you I just side B and pray
1913 2018-12-25 02:49:50 Less then 13% of Americans have pensions. 
And people rely on diversification into bonds that smooths out swings, especially close to retirement when they should be much less exposed to stocks.
Also underlines the importance of NOT privatizing Social Security, a @GOP dream.
1914 2018-12-25 02:49:49 Stocks with their worst December since The Great Depression.   Is a #TrumpDepression looming?  Time for @realDonaldTrump to stop making things worse!
1915 2018-12-25 02:49:43 And as the stock market keeps dropping, they keep losing.  They could pull out now, then after everything crashes again, they can buy stocks on the cheap, and get more shares.
1916 2018-12-25 02:48:12 Less then 13% of Americans have pensions.
And all people rely on diversification that smooths out swings like this, especially close to retirement when then should be much less exposed to stocks.
Also underlines the importance of NOT privatizing Social Security, a @GOP dream.
1917 2018-12-25 02:48:09 Dow just tanked more than 400 points as stocks are having the worst December since the Great Depression.
1918 2018-12-25 02:48:06 Stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression. WINNING!!!
1919 2018-12-25 02:47:54 Both of the McGauleyMotorsports Racecars 11k and 25 will be at Bubba Raceway Park January 5th for the 50 lap $2000 to win Street Stocks race! We will be doing autographs to whoever would like them at both of our trailers.
1920 2018-12-25 02:47:29 @AP @foxandfriends @DailyCaller @WayneDupreeShow @KevinJacksonTBS @rushlimbaugh @BillOReilly When Market crashes Some Smart PPL w/extra Money ( no borrowing) Buy Stocks at LOW PRICES, then Sell When Markets go back up!  Step Dad got Rich that way!
1921 2018-12-25 02:47:14 TRUMP: Are you still a believer in Santa?

1923 2018-12-25 02:46:34 "Stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression."  MAGA!!!
1924 2018-12-25 02:46:30 All stocks are going down the drain in the Trumpian era. Not exactly news.
1925 2018-12-25 02:46:10 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica
1926 2018-12-25 02:45:42 My understanding is that when the markets do what they are doing the rich still get richer. As stocks tank rich people snatch them up. Repubs want to RE-DO the housing bubble scam again because the rich got rich and then snatched up real estate when it popped.
1927 2018-12-25 02:45:36 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @FLOTUS Oil prices down to 1.80 cent gallon and holidays on the usa something aint correct the stockmarket should be going up not down..the elite rich selling off stocks to cause this, only happen few times with obama but not like this..
1928 2018-12-25 02:44:55 Im actually happy about this stocks have been too rich the last few years and im in my prime years for saving for retirement finally can build up portfolio while stocks are cheap.
1929 2018-12-25 02:44:43 Any stocks or mutuals you checking out? I'm depress tho...
1930 2018-12-25 02:43:39 apple stocks rise by 35%.
1931 2018-12-25 02:42:09 Some of the wealthiest, most corrupt oligarch friends of Agent Orange bought “puts” on major stocks and indices, and will profit from this latest TrumpFuckery. 

SEC closed down (shutdown), but follow the money.  @WSJbusiness @AliVelshi
1932 2018-12-25 02:41:45 Merry Christmas tweeps!! So the stocks have plunged to the same as December 1931 (great depression). Gotta love all this WINNING. Try to have a fantastic day!
1933 2018-12-25 02:41:27 Sorry, but you are coming at me unfairly. You clearly said that only rich people bought stocks in 2008. That is false. I pointed that out, and also said facts about how 401ks work.
1934 2018-12-25 02:41:00 Nobody is abandoning allies, fuck foreign enemies, stocks go up and down. Play the long game on trade and trump is right on this, we still want the wall, planned parenthood are still murderers! Petty Tweets, couldnt agree more.
1935 2018-12-25 02:40:58 @realDonaldTrump The major stock indexes fell more than 2 percent Monday, nudging the market closer to its worst year since 2008. Stocks are also on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression. Great job!
1936 2018-12-25 02:40:35 Good times for aviation and aerospace stocks coming
1937 2018-12-25 02:40:30 Presidents don’t have near as much control over the economy as we, or they, think. And the FED had nothing to do with the Market tanking. My money man has been telling me for months stocks were way overvalued.
1938 2018-12-25 02:40:04 So u may be right about *most people* not actually *owning* stocks, irrespective of 401ks or funds managed by others. But your statement of Trump supporters not *understanding* the stock market is arrogant. We are not all ignorant rednecks.
1939 2018-12-25 02:39:51 $100 is a lot wherever you are, but not a lot of money in stocks. The fees would add up quickly.
1940 2018-12-25 02:39:20 UFC 232 is like watching the recent development in the cannabis stocks. A god damn disaster. #zyne #UFC232
1941 2018-12-25 02:39:10 Maybe you should have thought about that before you did a trillion dollar tax cut that did NOTHING. Stocks are crashing. Thanks for NOTHING. Grinch
1942 2018-12-25 02:38:53 2009 is the last time most stocks were on a as me! Buy, buy, buy!

1945 2018-12-25 02:38:02 We are now in a bear market for stocks…!!! How’s your 401K’s now, all you smarty pants hybrid trickle down theorists. Windfall corporate tax cut giveaway really helped, didn’t it? Yeah, right.…it put the top on the stock market. 

STUPID ASSHOLES!!!
1946 2018-12-25 02:37:12 I am not a fawn of either. The legends do things without video cameras racing to sell their slogan. Was he wearing his IOF uniform? Carrying his AR-15 with bump stocks?
1947 2018-12-25 02:36:12 Trump taking credit for the markets' rise gave away his lack of understanding about what he was dealing with waaaayyy long ago. Best dump your stocks now before we drop 30% from here over the next year.
1948 2018-12-25 02:35:45 Congulations Donny on achieving, “Wordt Day Of Christmas Eve ever for US Stocks”. Now, you own that in US History, along with disgraceful GOP politicians who are there to serve themselves & not American public”. You w*tches!!
1949 2018-12-25 02:35:08 The problem is that he and his team have got the I know it all attitude, whereas the opposite is true these they cannot organise a piss up in a fully stocked up bar, actually what will end up happening is that all the beer stocks will disappear after they steal it all
1950 2018-12-25 02:35:00 Great to see prices on all stocks dramatically slashed for the holiday season!!

1951 2018-12-25 02:34:45 The pathetic part was when she told her dad she only turned to Bill out of anger and because a part of her shut down and she never though she would love again, so she was gonna be in a loveless marriage for stocks. Pathetic of Bill to be that thirsty and obsessed
1952 2018-12-25 02:34:21 It may have looked different but everyone was given a Christmas  gift today with the #StockMarket have a down day again. Stocks were cheaper and there were great bargains. #finance #stocks

1955 2018-12-25 02:32:47 Find Value and Buy, It's a Christmas sale on stocks.
1956 2018-12-25 02:32:45 Do not sell now if you don’t need money now.  Within a year to 18 months things will be back up. Hold on to your stocks and buy more on the low if you can.
1957 2018-12-25 02:32:20 Don't count on it. Remember, Trump's base doesn't own a lot of stocks.
1958 2018-12-25 02:32:05 @realDonaldTrump boasted about rising stock values. Of course, any educated person over the age of 12 knows that if you reduce taxes for the wealthy, they will use it for stocks buy-back. That’ll raise their value, not based on performance. But in time it’ll fall back down.
1959 2018-12-25 02:30:35 The stocks are down since Dems control house ...Demorats will hurt their own to make Trump look bad ..We know better Chuck and we all got your number ;)
1960 2018-12-25 02:30:24 If you ever feel bad about your playing ability in Smash Ultimate, just know that I just took all three of someone's stocks on Quickplay by charging Lucas’s up smash at the ledge.

I have video evidence.
1961 2018-12-25 02:30:23 Christmas Eve cookies around the tree has turned into my dad discussing bonds and stocks how is your evening going
1962 2018-12-25 02:29:14 I think they should see if anyone in the administration,congressman,senators,and their immediate family has any stocks in and suppliers or construction companies should be made to sell the shares.even though we aren’t paying for the FUCKING wall!!!
1963 2018-12-25 02:29:08 Selling stocks does little for the economy because businesses are stuck paying the investors profits for owning stocks.
1964 2018-12-25 02:28:10 Well then my friend, I have much respect for you.... big time...... I'm a hodler in crypto & investor in traditional stocks...

But not a trader, that side scares me lol  ......so mucho respecto
1965 2018-12-25 02:27:37 Oh he is losing money indeed , and I am sure from his  stocks as well . BUT it's the dems fault .
1966 2018-12-25 02:27:12 The bottom for stocks is when they trade at 10x PE
1967 2018-12-25 02:26:53 Let me see. Did you congratulate him when the stocks went up due to his tax breaks? Nope. But you seem to blame him now for the correction. So how incredibly hypocritical are you now. I bet your texting from your luxurious Vinyard. Did you pass out crumbs?
1968 2018-12-25 02:26:41 Lol rich people profit no what happens in predatory capitalism. Most likely they are shorting stocks
1969 2018-12-25 02:26:38 @VinceMcMahon the company lost 30 billion in shares cause of stocks falling,,drew mcintire is correct he is saving wwe he need be given a universal title shot with @BrockLesnar vs @DMcIntyreWWE no dq 2 fals out of 3 wins title ppv royal rumble @TripleH @shanemcmahon

1980 2018-12-25 02:23:19 When 4 out of 6 stocks gets gimped.
1981 2018-12-25 02:22:54 You forgot:
7. Bump stocks

Also I feel this list should be set to the tune of 12 days of Christmas.
1982 2018-12-25 02:22:52 He and his cronies are probably buying stocks now.
1983 2018-12-25 02:22:44 lmao the stocks, fuck them

oh dang never mind
1984 2018-12-25 02:22:38 Seeing Levi roots in stocks is one of the stranger moments of my year

1990 2018-12-25 02:20:43 I was just thinking 5 minutes ago about how much I wanted some stocks pound cake and then MY MOM PULLED SOME OUT AND GAVE ME THE BIGGEST PIECE this is the best ever
1991 2018-12-25 02:17:42 kinda ruined by him playing with 99 stocks imo
1992 2018-12-25 02:17:37 I read your tweet. I felt the need to say something because it’s not smart for people to worry when a month like this happens in stocks when you aren’t near retirement age, because selling high is a bad idea.
1993 2018-12-25 02:17:31 Out of food stocks.
1994 2018-12-25 02:17:02 Need to check Mnuchin’s recent stock transactions.  The way these crooks roll it’s highly possible he shorter stocks before he made his call.
1995 2018-12-25 02:16:45 Did anything really awful happen with EA in recent months? Their stocks went from $150 a pop to $75 a pop in a 3 month period (September to now). Weird.
1996 2018-12-25 02:16:27 Santa was nowhere to be seen on Wall Street as stocks suffered their worst Christmas Eve drop ever.
1997 2018-12-25 02:16:27 Stocks plummet! Thank you very much you despicable democrats! Because of your shenanigans, just like near the end of both Bush administrations you’re trying to put the economy in the tank ON PURPOSE! Despicable!#DemonRatParty
1998 2018-12-25 02:16:22 I agree about parents being retirement age, just pointing out some of the false things you said, with all due respect. If you had a job in 2008 and it had a 401k and you weren’t rich, you bought stocks in 2008 when they were much cheaper, so not only rich people bought them in 08
1999 2018-12-25 02:14:26 Bring your stocks to Mr Trump & he'll pay you 50 cents on the dollar

2007 2018-12-25 02:08:10 Merry Christmas to you two! Why is the stock market any measure of economic well-being? MOSTLY rich folks can afford stocks and shares. It affects less the majority of working people and working poor. The major concern about this shutdown is really about unpaid salaried workers.
2008 2018-12-25 02:07:48 Lol, good thing I dont own any stocks.
2009 2018-12-25 02:07:16 Dems are back in power and Stocks have tanked. Wake me up when Dems start paying for their crimes and corruption... until then. Meh. It's all pretty boring.
2010 2018-12-25 02:06:17 This Input buffer is slowly ruining ultimate for me :(. I keep playing trying to get used to it and I lose so many stocks from it.
2011 2018-12-25 02:05:51 trump is being awfully quiet about the stocks
2012 2018-12-25 02:05:20 @AgTechKY where are your stocks listed ??
2013 2018-12-25 02:05:17 Santa was nowhere to be seen on Wall Street as stocks suffered their worst Christmas Eve drop ever.
2014 2018-12-25 02:05:03 Santa was nowhere to be seen on Wall Street as stocks suffered their worst Christmas Eve drop ever.
2015 2018-12-25 02:04:57 And make a shitload of money from having lackeys short stocks when they were at highs (right before he launched his one-man war on the markets) and then buying at low prices right before he quits.
2016 2018-12-25 02:04:57 No more jewelry, Maybe some stocks instead 
2017 2018-12-25 02:04:47 Santa was nowhere to be seen on Wall Street as stocks suffered their worst Christmas Eve drop ever.
2018 2018-12-25 02:04:39 Thanks ! Unfortunately Jupiter in Sag isn't really a big mover for BTC, but Jupiter in Capricorn DEC 2019 is what we are waiting for for the real action. Have you gotten the 2019 report yet ? 
Jupiter is Sag can really exaggerate the markets up or down, look stocks right now....
2019 2018-12-25 02:04:19 Santa was nowhere to be seen on Wall Street as stocks suffered their worst Christmas Eve drop ever.
2020 2018-12-25 02:04:17 Stock market collapses have implications for the wider economy even if it's unfair, and most people aren't gambling in stocks.
2021 2018-12-25 02:03:19 Honestly, that’s the truth. I hate to be that guy, but sparking fear about the recently downturn in stocks is actually *bad*, because they normally go back up a few years later. And you can’t withdraw you’re 401k until in your 60s, so it’s actually OK unless you’re about 2 retire
2022 2018-12-25 02:02:48 Him and Trump's inner circle are shorting stocks...
2023 2018-12-25 02:02:42 "worst Christmas Eve for stocks in history"

2025 2018-12-25 02:00:12 Very stable. So many people are saying what a stable genius we have as president! That’s why stocks are down. The market is bored with all his stable genius financial management...
2026 2018-12-25 02:00:03 If we use the trump method we would order stocks then not pay for them.
2027 2018-12-25 01:59:57 Santa really delivered this year. We got cheap bitcoin and cheap stocks! #justwhatiwanted #MerryChrismas
2028 2018-12-25 01:59:04 we basically are haveing the 1987 crash again...this time it is etfs/algos making the moves worse..works on upside as well...20 percent with econ and companies seeing slowdown but not recession...stocks are getting very attractive but cant buy until jan 1
2029 2018-12-25 01:58:59 The fed raising interest rates plays a huge roll in this latest market correction. We were so effed up by QE 3&4 and the rates being all the way at 0, that any raising of interest rates will have a neg impact on the stocks market. Not the economy as a whole. There’s a difference
2030 2018-12-25 01:58:49 I followed him for a while because I thought he was a good data guy but he is a caricature of the worst of the far left.  Imagine thinking only very rich people have stocks.
2031 2018-12-25 01:58:46 One has to wonder if someone was shorting stocks on insider knowledge. Just sayin'.
2032 2018-12-25 01:58:25 Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is affordable housing and 40% off stocks. #MerryChristmas
2033 2018-12-25 01:58:11 What have you done? You dont do anything for these parents or the survivors. We have a president that is actually backing up what he said he would do and your trying to critique

Who put a permanent ban on Bump stocks.. ?  Not Nancy Pelosi or the Dems!
2034 2018-12-25 01:56:56 Should i sell My VT, VB, and HD stocks? They've plummeted  also what are great blue chip high dividend giving stocks? #finance #homeworkslave
2035 2018-12-25 01:56:42 The more you keep talking about the fed the lower the stocks will drop! You are spooking the investors and there running for the door! The fed is independent of the gov and must show that they don’t bend to what you say!!!
2036 2018-12-25 01:55:34 Got to love a "progressive"in an IOF uniform carrying an ASR-15 with 5 bump stocks.
2037 2018-12-25 01:53:33 How many rich liberals are dumping stocks? Heard Soros has been. What about others? If hundreds of millions in stock are being dumped in concert with Fed raising rates it'll accelerate crash. These assholes will swoop in when it all hits bottom & get even richer on the rebound.
2038 2018-12-25 01:53:06 .@Vinny_Banks I've just hit that sweet spot of drinking where I could go empty our alcohol stocks over an hour or two while playing video games while my Mum and Missus are asleep.

I've also slated myself to cook breakfast and dinner for Christmas Day. 

That's fucked that then!
2039 2018-12-25 01:52:51 I was 30 yr military and a DoD civilian...furloughed several times. Always got the pay retroactively. Hang in there.  And yes, stocks are on sale, so hang in there too and buy if you can.  Merry Christmas.
2040 2018-12-25 01:52:09 Thank you. I appreciate it.  My Dad thought I was lying about the 125 billion. It was just so bizarre. He also thinks that our economy is booming and jobs are at an all time high b/c of Obama but stocks are down b/c of trump. He’s a CNN watcher. There was no stopping him.
2041 2018-12-25 01:51:02 Did Trump’s family & friends short the stocks & make a fortune?
2042 2018-12-25 01:48:14 I bet his friends are all shorting stocks.

2045 2018-12-25 01:45:00 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to assuage investors’ rising anxiety with a hastily called meeting of top financial regulators Monday as U.S. stocks plummeted to a 20-month low - Bloomberg
2046 2018-12-25 01:44:54 It was probably done purposely to buy back short fall stocks at lower prices.  Totally scam?

2049 2018-12-25 01:42:38 I look at the 1y chart of so many stocks/ETFs I would like to own and they look like screaming buys. Then I look at the 5y chart.... still elevated.

Merck:  PDUFA on December 28.
Ford:  December Sales Conference Call on January 3.

2055 2018-12-25 01:39:20 Aussie population IMO  will be consisting of only two classes by 2019 end : 1 ) Gold and Silver stocks investors invested fully now  2) Rest of the population
Lets see how this one works out 
2056 2018-12-25 01:39:00 When hedge funds and liberal investors start dumping and shorting stocks, investors should get out of the way until they are nearly finished. Based on the trajectory and the goal they are trying to achieve, better be a patient buyer than get burned.

2059 2018-12-25 01:37:44 If your portfolio STILL has some suspect stocks, sell tomorrow itself. 

Move to stocks which can survive a big plunge! 

Note - i cleaned up my portfolio in 2011. I still do experiment with a few low quality stocks but % in portfolio would be just 5-6%.

2060 2018-12-25 01:37:12 Collapsing? LOL Trump is an idiot. He's gone in 2 years. The Tsar will leave the way Stalin left. Stocks? LOL 10 years of a Bull Market and you panic after 3 months of a Bear Market. Debt? Raise taxes.
2061 2018-12-25 01:37:03 Only because their stocks are getting hit, and they know he's toast!

2064 2018-12-25 01:35:23 Here is what’s happening with the stock market. In early 2018, people put a lot of money in stocks which will explain why it started growing during Trump. Then, people started pulling out money at the end of the year to get their profit. And that’s how stock market went down now
2065 2018-12-25 01:35:13 No, the only problem with the economy is the up and down cycles that occur naturally.  Stocks have been overvalued for a while so it was just a matter of time.  What is  exacerbating the correction is the uncertainty caused by your poor administration of the executive office.
2066 2018-12-25 01:35:11 I had a co-worker in 2001, in his mid 50s... I was impressed that he had somewhere around a quarter million in stocks... I hadn't talked w/ him for years, but, spoke to him not too long after 2008... he'd lost his house and almost everything... in his 60s by then...
2067 2018-12-25 01:34:40 Here is what’s happening with the stock market. In early 2018, people put a lot of money in stocks which will explain why it started growing during Trump. Then, people started pulling out money at the end of the year to get their profit. And that’s how stock market went down now
2068 2018-12-25 01:34:17 LW: Since August, the stock market has been continually falling, with tech stocks taking by far the biggest hit. In fact, the Nasdaqwhich is
2069 2018-12-25 01:33:44 Stocks close for worst Christmas Eve in history as Trump (and Mnuchin) fuel Christmas Eve drop.
White House chaos, government shutdown, incompetence, rambling tweets and falling confidence. #MAGA
2070 2018-12-25 01:33:24 Stocks fall 631 points today, lowest spot this year, worst December since 1931.
2071 2018-12-25 01:32:59 Yet most of Trump's base don't own stocks or mutual funds. Ultimately, the market tanking won't change their cult-like following of him.
2072 2018-12-25 01:32:38 The same way Gold is up when stocks are down.  Uncorrelated asset class.  Either way, I expect us to go sideways for 12 months then up up up Jan 2020 as the Halving starts getting priced in. The legacy finance market won’t affect that imo.
2073 2018-12-25 01:31:43 Trading stocks is like playing poker.
2074 2018-12-25 01:31:38 Your country now is collapsing trump,debt,stocks hehe
2075 2018-12-25 01:31:05 This law, if described correctly, doesn’t ban bump stocks because the gun discharges with a pull of the trigger each time not a dingle pull. Idiots don’t understand enough to write a law.
2076 2018-12-25 01:30:41 I just played a game of teams online and daisy sd'd and lost 2 stocks for it???

2079 2018-12-25 01:29:42 okay comrades, before we keep celebrating the #ChristmasDip, i have more news.
i remebered my econ course and the relationship between stocks and commodities, and after a search, i just found out that economists are expecting prices for gas and energy to rise.
expect inflation
2080 2018-12-25 01:29:40 @realDonaldTrump claims, when stocks go up, it's proof of #Trump's genius, but when they go down, it's someone else's fault. Probably a conspiracy by the #DeepDtate's allies, the deep private sector. #TrumpChristmasShutdown
2081 2018-12-25 01:28:11 If my dream is right about the trade war tension between America and China, it's another of those dream, that the reason there was a sell-off because the China's investors are the culprit of the sell-off. Any American stocks they own has to be liquidated for fear of tariff taxes
2082 2018-12-25 01:27:04 Trump stocks are proving to be as much of a failure as Trump steaks
2083 2018-12-25 01:26:35 Keep an eye put for sales on your favorite stocks! #BlackFridayButForWallStreet
2084 2018-12-25 01:26:28 If crypto is now correlated with stocks we're done. Because while the stock market was rising crypto was collapsing. If we now go down with the market we'll be seeing bitcoin $400
2085 2018-12-25 01:26:20 Se faire 3 stocks en 42 secondes c'est chaud quand même
2086 2018-12-25 01:26:15 We need the uptick rule reinstated. I like shorting stocks but without buyers stepping up and little liquidity the market needs this implemented
2087 2018-12-25 01:26:02 Someone is having a tantrum over a wall he wants to build...

As I'm a Canadian, I can't judge US politic, but my stocks are getting destroyed in the process. Sad!
2088 2018-12-25 01:25:52 Shorting stocks??
2089 2018-12-25 01:25:43 Might not feel obvious right now, but a friendly reminder, if you pick up stocks 50% down from their ATH’s and they get back to them glorious prices you have a 100% gain on your books.
2090 2018-12-25 01:25:26 I’ve been buying $URPTF mostly because if Uranium goes from $28 to $35 and the Uranium mining stocks don’t move... it will help me avoid frustration. This is knowing oneself and anticipating emotional hurdles that could cause issues.
2091 2018-12-25 01:25:18 Hypothesis: the #TaxScam sucked up a lot of resources used to buy up stocks, essentially overheating some economic signals and giving a lot of people false confidence

The market now appears to be seeingTrump's incompetence at the same time the overheating cools
2092 2018-12-25 01:24:57 hive knights in suits, making calls, watching stocks, Marketing,
2093 2018-12-25 01:24:27 All stocks.
2094 2018-12-25 01:23:02 Following the latest US stock slump, Japanese stocks have returned this Christmas morning from a 3-day weekend with a 4% slump for the Nikkei. It's in what would be near-market territory if it closes here. Taiwan's Taiex is off 1.5%. China opens in under 10 minutes.
2095 2018-12-25 01:22:37 The economy is going down, stocks are down down..worse President ever.
2096 2018-12-25 01:21:14 Didn’t folks complain when market was up as wages down?  Now wages going up and stocks are down
2097 2018-12-25 01:20:56 Bear market for US stocks. Meanwhile, the 2s/10s yield curve slope expands to nearly 18 bips. Was under 10 a couple of weeks ago. #markets
2098 2018-12-25 01:20:54 I thought #AncientAliens banned bump stocks!
2099 2018-12-25 01:20:15 Still better then lots of other stocks.
2100 2018-12-25 01:20:03 The stock price is a prediction of future dividends

If you invest only in stocks that have an existing history of paying dividends you reduce a certain amount of risk, but at the cost of a certain amount of potential growth
2101 2018-12-25 01:19:53 The wealthy are jumping for joy at the market correction. Unfortunately the middle class will sell their under valued stocks to the wealthy now. Panicking that the market is losing them money. Of course then jump back in when it starts to go up again.
2102 2018-12-25 01:19:21 Agreed. People are looking to buy "cheap" stuff. Not scared yet. Though I do believe there is a big difference between the NFLX, NVDA, AMZNs of the world and stocks like AAPL.
2103 2018-12-25 01:19:10 Bet his stocks took a hit as well. Why do I not feel bad? 
2104 2018-12-25 01:19:09 Markets controlled by Globalist elites. FED is a minimal effect. Joe Blow selling stocks doesn’t mean shit. Billionaires selling stocks doesn’t mean shit. We know who is behind this. Same families that control the world banking systems.
2105 2018-12-25 01:18:16 Don't play the penny stocks.
2106 2018-12-25 01:17:43 The richest 10% of America owns 84% of stocks and mutual funds.
2107 2018-12-25 01:17:18 So now Cryptos are going to follow stocks down? Maybe gold and silver will shine again after all.
2108 2018-12-25 01:17:00 The admin has been short selling stocks all week.
2109 2018-12-25 01:16:44    

gold down is 4% not much different from stocks. Also gold is not going 8x. Stop watching the infomercials.
2110 2018-12-25 01:16:04 It's disingenuous and elitist to say only old rich white men are affected by the stock market downturn. Many mutual funds hold stocks for pensions for teachers fire and police men and other middle class workers. The rich have already manipulated the markets & pulled their money
2111 2018-12-25 01:15:20 Good point, not sure about the "stocks" but the importance is that all of this be brought out into the open.
2112 2018-12-25 01:15:08 What's up is his up is his highness has stocks plummeting due to the chaos and govt shutdown.
2113 2018-12-25 01:15:04 Which Trump is shorting stocks?
2114 2018-12-25 01:14:42 You don't know what youre talking abt. PPl put money investments that are accessible to them & for most  that include stocks.  To call talking abt the 401k tone deaf just says you'll say anything to dismiss the topic.
2115 2018-12-25 01:14:34 Nice try, but you did say Mexico would pay for the wall. Mantle it like you said. And btw, why do you take all the credit when stocks rise, but place blame when they take a dive? #resign
2116 2018-12-25 01:14:23 We’ll have investing in US stocks in January so it’s not applicable for this December.
2117 2018-12-25 01:14:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2118 2018-12-25 01:13:53 45 thinks his work is top notch
He’s posing in the mirror with his hand on his crotch
But stocks are at an all time low
and Federal workers were dealt a blow
If this is what it means to be respected
Someone else should have been elected

2120 2018-12-25 01:13:04 Stocks at their lowest point in history for Dec 24. Wow. YOU. ARE. A. FAILURE.
2121 2018-12-25 01:12:57 You know what else makes this a dumb chart and a dumb point?

Yes of course most of the wealth within the stock market is held by the wealthiest, just like everything else. That's just not relevant. How much of middle class wealth is in stocks is a different question.
2122 2018-12-25 01:12:13 Day 704: Stocks tank and trading closes on Christmas Eve in one of the worst states in "the worst Christmas Eve trading day ever". Trump, of course, is quick to blame everyone but himself, but oddly enough stocks started tumbling the day he named himself "Tariff Man". #resist
2123 2018-12-25 01:11:56 @jimcramer 

Finally time to perhaps start buying or nibbling on those stocks you have recommended all year CRM, maybe BP, CVS, but cautious
2124 2018-12-25 01:11:53 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica
2125 2018-12-25 01:10:43 Stocks, through and through. Easier to understand and monitor, plus the risk of a surprising plummet is lower
2126 2018-12-25 01:10:27 Now I understand your position in the matter, being an investment teacher. I've dabbled in stocks but I'm by no means an expert. I certainly wouldn't suggested it for poor folks as a whole, but an individual with good guidance has a shot.
By the way thank you for your service

2130 2018-12-25 01:09:21 Most *people* don’t own stocks. And he appeals to the poorer, marginalized demographics among us. The flyover states who have been hurting and losing jobs. This isn’t arrogance it’s basic observation and census data 
2131 2018-12-25 01:09:18 So Trump got no credit for stock market rise but blamed for the bear market. Stocks were all time high in October then midterms. How stupid are you haters? How’s your 401k?
2132 2018-12-25 01:08:43 Trump allies and the wealthy are dumping the stocks so they can buy it back with the gains from Trumps tax cuts.
2133 2018-12-25 01:08:24 stocks = down
bourgeoisie = Owned
2134 2018-12-25 01:08:09 Stocks went up ,unemployment is down ,tax brackets lowered and the reason the stocks are going down is because of the feds raising interest rates ,yes he deserved some credit for the rise but the banks are the reason for the fall
2135 2018-12-25 01:08:08 I just sold all my stocks. I’ll get the funds Wednesday and sock it away somewhere safer for a while.
2136 2018-12-25 01:08:03 Ok, in case none of you knows this, I will be the one to tell you.
BUMP STOCKS:
-You can make a superior bumpstock to those they are now banning, using a denim coat w/pockets, and a leather belt with a simple belt loop & buckle.

So yeah, ban bump stocks.
Idiots.
2137 2018-12-25 01:07:54 How's the market doing
2138 2018-12-25 01:07:37 I often listen to Marketplace on NPR and what they like to say is that the economy is not the stock market. Unfortunately, unlike previous downturns, this is hitting EVERYTHING, bonds, stocks, everything. The tax cut bump is crashing back down and the tariffs are now kicking in.
2139 2018-12-25 01:07:05 Stocks down big, cryptos down big... Merry Christmas ya fuckin degens. #Crypto #Stocks
2140 2018-12-25 01:07:02 Santa is only buying from local stores this year. Totally tanked US stocks!
2141 2018-12-25 01:07:00 Alarmed traders are dumping stocks, sending the S&P 500 to 2008 Bush lows — while Cuck's odd attempt to soothe markets backfired
2142 2018-12-25 01:06:23 Well, I guess if it keeps on we can all buy thousands of stocks for a nickel, making us very rich in the long run?
2143 2018-12-25 01:05:10 YOU are trying to create a permanent sense of panic, while making it worse. Stocks need correction, the Fed's a private bank that rips us all off, and Mattis served longer than Obama's last 3 SecDefs. Oh, he fired Mattis, too, you hypocrite tool.
2144 2018-12-25 01:05:04 What...didn’t you just convince them to buy US stocks about 3 weeks ago?   I think they might be out of money by now.
2145 2018-12-25 01:04:32 Perhaps that’s why Benjamin Graham said that in the short run stocks are a voting machine, but in the long run a weighing machine.
2146 2018-12-25 01:04:19 Hey orange fat man @realDonaldTrump you wouldn't be deliberately shooting your mouth off about the @federalreserve so your brood could take advantage of the market volatility & take short positions on certain stocks would they? If so, the SEC and the @IRStaxpros may want a word
2147 2018-12-25 01:03:50 @realDonaldTrump Stocks Worst EVER since 2008! Merry Christmas!
2148 2018-12-25 01:02:54 Comprehensive ones don’t. Specifically:

- prevent individuals with a history of violent social media threats and/or domestic violence history from owning firearms

- ban the future sale and current non-sporting use of fully automatic rifles and bump stocks

2150 2018-12-25 01:02:24 Better return in 2019: Your "stocks" or My POWER NINE

(Grammar added for effect)
2151 2018-12-25 01:02:22 Wonder how many of Trump's cronies made money shorting stocks today?  Seems fishy.  Just an observation.  A bunch of grifters in office.
2152 2018-12-25 01:02:20 Blame Fed for the tanking stock market@nypost: No point. Most stocks have been covertly overvalued for a few years, such fall (or call it correction) is expected. Somehow a drop of ~5000 points, ~22%, within weeks can be nasty. No more Merry Xmas, ho, ho. 2019 could be worse.
2153 2018-12-25 01:01:47 It's very strange as churches are so rich including Vatican but Christmas makes US stocks Dollar to drop? is that a different God in the US and not Christian? Then is Christianity against United States ? If its sibling rivalry I ditch those so called Christian siblings for sure
2154 2018-12-25 01:01:46 Oh no! Stocks are down! They'll never go back up! Rich people are losing money! Oh no!

As if anyone is actually losing money. The market is responding to Fed chair Powell from last Wednesday, nobody is losing money; they're going to make more money in the medium/long run.
2155 2018-12-25 01:01:27 He didn't take the highroad he just banned bump stocks and probably all semiauto firearm weaponry due to anti-gun people in charge of writing these bills with extra clauses and definitions.
2156 2018-12-25 01:00:24 They buy the entire market of stocks and sell but have algorithms doing this favouring this or that stock. Reprogram the algorithm and you can crash the mkt. ECONOMICALLY NO REASON FOR CRASH!!!

2158 2018-12-25 00:59:50 As Wall Street cries in their tears, you know they have enough money to all get together and give old goofy Trump his Wall Money, but heck did they even give that one single thought..nope..and so all their stocks crashed today, kind of well deserved..
2159 2018-12-25 00:59:40 Stocks TANKED today.  Where's Trump taking the blame for this?
2160 2018-12-25 00:59:28 Sucks if ya own stocks.
2161 2018-12-25 00:59:18 Alarmed traders are dumping stocks, sending the S&P 500 to 2008 lows — while Mnuchin's odd attempt to soothe markets backfired
2162 2018-12-25 00:58:37 Stocks are down? Cool. Wonderful. Perfect.

You got a $50 gift card from grandma? Cool. Buy some stocks. They'll be worth more in January.

Thanks, @realDonaldTrump. He's #MakingChristmasGreatAgain.
2163 2018-12-25 00:58:37 And all of those in the stock market—business owners, CEOs—feel a little poorer going into the new year.  So less inclined to hire, expand. Or to give big raises and bonuses. So yeah, if you don’t own stocks you’re still getting fucked by Trump driving the market into a ditch
2164 2018-12-25 00:58:13 Right, the rich are shorting stocks and then buying them at fire sale prices. If you can stand to lose tens of millions you stand to make hundreds of millions. 

I've lost a boatload of value in my retirement.
2165 2018-12-25 00:57:52 Man, trump is even ruining my stocks. What a shit christmas present.
2166 2018-12-25 00:57:33 The stock market is falling.  Part of it is companies have stopped doing stock buy backs.  Part of it is nervousness about whether we are heading into a recession.  Individual people who have their retirement in stocks are pulling out.
2167 2018-12-25 00:57:21 So what you are saying is that you have no option on which funds you can put your money in? Sound like a lousy deal.  If it's an age base "model" then the younger you are the more you would likely be invested in stocks. The older you are the more you are invested in bonds.
2168 2018-12-25 00:57:00 Well I guess you can laugh all you want.  Time will tell huh?  Someone in the Oval Office wouldn’t listen when he should have in Feb.  you think the Tariffs didn’t play a part?  But you know.  Check out who will be buying back stocks at cheap cost.  One of trumps tactic
2169 2018-12-25 00:56:45 As it is the stocks are less than 10 percent above Jan 20 2017. Obama:  he started at 7550.29 and left office with 19,827.25. Obama 150% gain trump 10% and falling. @realDonaldTrump says a president should be judged by the markets. So let him be judged.
2170 2018-12-25 00:56:12 Who gives a fuck? Most people are heavily invested in stocks in their 401ks for growth in their 30s, 40s and early 50s.

We may not own as many as the rich, but not having the capital to  diversify & play games like shorting, we get hit *worse* than they do when the market tanks.
2171 2018-12-25 00:55:32 I feel like this time of year it’s Black Friday sales for stocks
2172 2018-12-25 00:54:57 Merry Christmas Bill.  Well, are you buying while everyone else is panic selling? Seems like a good time to buy stocks cheap.
2173 2018-12-25 00:54:44 @AAII_Invest_Ed  watching this? What are we doing to educate PEOPLE to own STOCKS?
2174 2018-12-25 00:54:07 Some guy doesn’t like the way I’m bullish when stocks are going up and flip to bearish when they’re going down. isn’t that the point?
2175 2018-12-25 00:53:00 The best thing about a drop in the DOW and S&P 500 is the fluff is being removed and stocks are getting back to normal valuations.
2176 2018-12-25 00:52:45 It does impact rich people who have a lot of their money in stocks
2177 2018-12-25 00:52:06 Toni, are you an expert on how drugs enter the country?  Also, stocks were up until the Fed and Democrats got involved
2178 2018-12-25 00:51:38 The rich love this.  They probably sold high then can buy stocks back after collapse
2179 2018-12-25 00:51:35 That's because Brian, it's hurting them where it hurts the most.. in their stock portfolios, they don't care about the shutdown and the many people who are affected by it, just don't mess with THEIR money or stocks
2180 2018-12-25 00:50:54 “US stocks plunge as Donald Trump likens Federal Reserve to bad golfer” He is by far the worst President USA had the misfortune of producing! Get rid of the joker,you will be better off! 
2181 2018-12-25 00:49:44 As far as I can tell the AUS market has bottomed but of course it'll just keep working its way lower if the DOW keeps having 600 point falls.

But there's just no selling left in smaller stocks , only panic dumping into very low liquidity
2182 2018-12-25 00:49:36 Well that tweet went down well huh?  A ‘tremendous’ plunge in US stocks.
2183 2018-12-25 00:48:22 Another idiot who doesn’t understand economics 

FYI, lots of rich people short sell stocks and make a ton of money when markets crash. 

The people who suffer are those laid off by businesses when they suddenly become cash poor. 

Learn what ur talking about, or shut your mouth.
2184 2018-12-25 00:47:45 Here is how I feel after I buy stocks lately.
2185 2018-12-25 00:47:33 If you had any sense you would be buying boatloads of Blue Chip stocks right now. The market is driven by emotions right now and not by fundamentals.
2186 2018-12-25 00:47:09 My dear husband is in his mid seventies,& medically disabled, I’m in my mid sixties&medically disabled. Our ONLY income in his SS, my SSDI,&our SMALL 401k savings in stocks.We expected stock st drop, we didn’t expect them to be decimated. Food,fuel,utilities & every NECESSITY UP
2187 2018-12-25 00:46:40 I'm patiently waiting for pod stocks settled, expecting $CGC 20US$, $ACB between US$2.5-4 then make a kill. Wish all Merrier Xmas!
2188 2018-12-25 00:45:52 Do you people understand the DOW is an index of only 30 stocks. Have you ever heard of the S&P 500, SPX, /ES. You like to dumb down your audience.  You perpetuate a number that has much less meaning than it used to. Make a change.
2189 2018-12-25 00:45:09 On his Last stock 75% up and us chads are 2 stocks up
2190 2018-12-25 00:45:08 Never mentioned anything about building the economy. Just saying creating jobs makes people happy, feel good about themself. And maybe I don't have a clue how economics work, but looking at rhe stocks, neither does your president
2191 2018-12-25 00:45:05 I have to say this the worst Christmas I have so far. I can not sleep every night. I paid all of my money in US stocks. Look, Santa told me, this year, my gift is” take a beating”! !
2192 2018-12-25 00:44:50 happy holidays!!!! spread the good vibes! all your favorite stocks are on sale :) @Jfilche
2193 2018-12-25 00:44:06 Could help some of my stocks! In usd terms.
2194 2018-12-25 00:43:49 @realDonaldTrump You are not alone Sir, We the Citizens of USA are with you in Spirit, so lift up your eyes and pray to the Lord The Almighty.  He is right beside you and will guide you.  The Fed Reserve is causing the Stocks to take a dive & of their fear of the Dems in Congress
2195 2018-12-25 00:43:44 No it isnt. It was your tax scam. The corporations are done buying back billions of their stocks. You 'great economy' was a house of cards ready to crash after the the stock buy back finished. Then Mr Stable Genius launches a trade war. It's YOUR economy shit for brains.
2196 2018-12-25 00:43:23 Stocks started to drop as soon as Dems won the house
2197 2018-12-25 00:43:03 Banned bump stocks and in talks about nationwide background checks.
2198 2018-12-25 00:42:34 WHEN will #TRUMP BE OUT OF OFFICE? (Democrats control the House on Jan 3, #Mueller investigations may be nearing completion, GOP are distancing selves from him.) #WhiteHouse #Shutdown #ShutdownStories #TrumpCrash #TrumpResign #stocks #cdnpoli #Mexico #Germany #RussiaGate #
2199 2018-12-25 00:42:11 @realDonaldTrump owns this: "The Dow fell 2.91% and the S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Xmas Eve declines in history.  Stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession, and the last time the market fell so far in Dec. was in 1931, during the Great Depression.
2200 2018-12-25 00:41:51 Disagree at least initially

I want a couple months of this, then let the 9 stocks fall where they may
2201 2018-12-25 00:41:23 “But Mr. Mnuchin’s public efforts to soothe investors [by calling bank CEOs] may have had the opposite effect, analysts said, with bank stocks falling along with most other assets Monday.” WSJ Dec 24, 2018. Next time, I wouldn’t take the call, if I were bank CEO. Bad for business
2202 2018-12-25 00:41:06 Note to everyone with a 401(k)

You need to call your administrator and have them move all of your funds into a 'principal protection' account. This is basically cash, but it can't lose value. Your stocks on the other hand, can go to zero.
2203 2018-12-25 00:40:45 If you had listened to the news, you'd have known which stocks would take a hit.
2204 2018-12-25 00:40:34 What are the odds that Mnuchin sent warning to all his Wall Street and corporate cronies who are short selling stocks, making millions, screwing over American workers (again), and having a holiday toast?!   #Swamp
2205 2018-12-25 00:40:00 So let me get this straight...

Stocks were up under @BarackObama but it was despite his work to crash the market. 

Stocks were up year 1 under @realDonaldTrump he gets all the credit

Market has the worst month in 70+ years under @GOP but it's still #Democrats fault?
2206 2018-12-25 00:39:59 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2207 2018-12-25 00:39:57 Investors move out to the bond market, he added more to the deficit, wrecked a few retirement accounts, on stocks that are over priced...smooth move exlax.
2208 2018-12-25 00:37:44 Depends on your situation, I personally  would use like 10k-20k to pay off certain things and completely reduce my payments like car, and update my pc for music production so I can without hiccups make my music. Rest of the 80k would be invested in stocks and other businesses.
2209 2018-12-25 00:37:17 Merry Christmas to everyone If you have stocks or mutual funds, my present to you is simple advice: do *NOT* look at your portfolio now. Just know they are in a wasteland, but will likely bounce back over time once our current timeline is adjusted favorably
2210 2018-12-25 00:36:07 Damn I hope not.  Between stocks and now crypto!!!  Merry Christmas??  Can I get a happy new year?
2211 2018-12-25 00:35:28 Put them in The Stocks and throw hyper-inflated tomatoes at them?

2214 2018-12-25 00:35:06 Dumping stocks here is probably a bit too late.. but u never know
2215 2018-12-25 00:33:33 I mean yes it is cycles. But I can agree that Trump just makes it more severe. He pushed the market even further with his tax cuts (that corporations use to buy back stocks). Pushing it further so they can sell things off.

2220 2018-12-25 00:31:31 That’s cuz stocks aren’t your assets
2221 2018-12-25 00:31:21 what stocks? and how much of it
2222 2018-12-25 00:30:55 wanna invest in a bunch of stocks
2223 2018-12-25 00:29:58 ETF's are the problem. Three biggest control 50 perc of stocks. There s no logical economic argument for 30 perc drop since oct for 1/4% rate hike. It s political. It's a coup via finance.
2224 2018-12-25 00:29:44 "despite the fact that almost half of all households owned stock shares either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, trusts, or various pension accounts, the richest 10 percent of households controlled 84 percent of the total value of these stocks in 2016."
2225 2018-12-25 00:29:08 Ya might want to look at the 2k election stocks before making assumptions.
2226 2018-12-25 00:29:00 I'd focus on shorting individual stocks.... despite the market meltdown,  there's always individual stocks that are gapping up into resistance and reverse lower!!

Like that $NKE trade setup shared last week for example !
2227 2018-12-25 00:28:58 I took the stocks out of mine in time. Making a little is better than losing a lot.
2228 2018-12-25 00:28:15 Mnuchin says definitely nothing to worry about, no reason to sell more stocks, and absolutely zero chance there will be a run on the banks but even if there is the banks can absorb it so everybody just go home and enjoy the last Christmas we’ll ever have.
2229 2018-12-25 00:28:09 It won’t be long before our stocks & 401k’s are going to be trading on the OTC market, then the day traders and market makers might let us come up for air, yes I am livid with the market crooks
2230 2018-12-25 00:26:45 You’re the idiot. Most middle class and below people have only 401ks that they can’t touch for long time, along with some other long term investments. It’s the rich people that trade stocks more frequently.
2231 2018-12-25 00:26:19 Also companies with diving stocks tend to take it out on the lower end of their workers. But they took that job so corporate stooge, or something
2232 2018-12-25 00:26:04 “Some stocks”
2233 2018-12-25 00:25:58 My advice to all liberals is sell all your  stocks now if you have them which I doubt, but the secret is buy high and sell low.
2234 2018-12-25 00:24:49 Buying the bank stocks in 09
2235 2018-12-25 00:24:42 Just gave basic stock advice. I know this account is about local real estate, but stocks and real estate have A LOT in common.

Much is in the research. The rest is up to market cycles. Then mesh the two for practical, lower risk, higher reward decisions. Yep. - Kevin #fxbg
2236 2018-12-25 00:24:39 If you knew anything about stocks, this is the time to buy! You sell stocks when the market is high and you buy them when the market is low! Lesson 1. 
2237 2018-12-25 00:24:00 #Stocks have the best chance of achieving high returns over long periods. A healthy dose will help ensure that your savings grows faster than inflation, increasing the purchasing power of your #nestegg.

Not that hard, being 81 he should be in bonds not stocks
2241 2018-12-25 00:23:26 None of us heard of bump stocks until one incident and they want to keep us from having them.  Total bs.
2242 2018-12-25 00:21:50 She’s already deified. Liberals are throwing their organs at her. I’m buying popcorn stocks.

2244 2018-12-25 00:21:17 @DRUDGE_REPORT
Stocks close for worst Christmas Eve in history as Trump and Mnuchin fuel Christmas Eve drop.

White House chaos, government shutdown, incompetence, rambling tweets and falling confidence. 

More Americans are now asking when will this all end?

2246 2018-12-25 00:21:08 My stocks are in Trump’s swamp!
2247 2018-12-25 00:20:15 If you have a long time horizon the riskiest things you can invest in that "feel" safe are bonds, cash, gold, and defensive stocks. 

10 years down the road these assets will likely have hindered your returns greatly, even if stocks fall further.

2249 2018-12-25 00:18:59 Hey jackass being a macro economist is different from being a trader, especially since trading financial instruments or picking stocks is a short term market specific thing (AKA micro economics). Way to try and pretend you’re smarter than you actually are.
2250 2018-12-25 00:18:50 The stocks are down for two reasons: 1 normal correction 2 Dems won the House (economists hate number 2)
2251 2018-12-25 00:18:29 Initially, JWA is used for stocks to (badly) patch some issues. While they exist, they are very minor, and the difference between SM5 JWA/Stock JWA is waaaay smaller than SM5 noJWA/Stock JWA.
So even if it's not the intended meaning, for fairness it's better to have it everywhere

Nothing in your tweet makes any real logical sense at all...lol
2260 2018-12-25 00:16:05 Maybe Trump is conspiring with traders who are shorting stocks before he tweets...

U.S. stocks plunged 653 points today in their worst Christmas Eve trading ever. So much winning.
2262 2018-12-25 00:14:58 This is just a hunch. But perhaps we should be watching Trump et al to see if they're buying stocks right now.
2263 2018-12-25 00:14:41 Hi. I trade stocks. It’s literally the worst christmas eve performance in history. This is fact, not bias reporting. In fact, as of this moment, it’s the worst December performance in history. We may see recovery post-holiday, or not— but try not to confuse “bad news” and “lie.”
2264 2018-12-25 00:14:17 Hey big guy, more 1sts for you! The Dow fell 2.91%, S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in biggest Christmas Eve decline in the 2 indices' history & after stocks last week had worst week for a decade. Still winning!

2267 2018-12-25 00:12:48 Or, Joe Sixpack becomes intelligent and realizes you buy stocks when their value goes down and sells them when their value rises
2268 2018-12-25 00:12:41 You don’t want any stocks in a bear market
2269 2018-12-25 00:12:19 BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity and JP Morgan own 80% of the stocks in the S&P 500.  They all have the same algorithms which causes stocks to go up and down at the same time
2270 2018-12-25 00:11:35 Did he short sell any stocks before the market tanked again today? Did his friends? Did trump or any of his friends?
2271 2018-12-25 00:11:31 Clover you need reasons. Your clover stocks are down just as much on average from what I can tell. Without reasons, you gain zero cred calling for lower prices in a bear market affecting 90% of bios
2272 2018-12-25 00:10:51 I think UVXY is a fund not a stock, correct? Funds (a collection of stocks) are less risky and on average do escape getting crashed.

2278 2018-12-25 00:08:43 They’re probably shorting stocks right now.
2279 2018-12-25 00:08:24 Is Deutsche Bank state owned? Idk. But if it is, you could be correct. I think it could be the bank this oligarch has buying all his stocks in the aluminum company he owns. Just a hunch. VTB I think its called.
2280 2018-12-25 00:08:11 Stocks tanked faster than in the Great Depression, today, because of YOU.
2281 2018-12-25 00:05:28 Stocks started to plummet when DNC was voted to control the house and their is t anything on his desk for him to sign so must be a Democratic shutdown as well. Millions voted for Trump and the wall so build it

2287 2018-12-25 00:04:21 The msm and the NYtribes are destroying the market to hurt trump and the American people.taxes and Regs
are lower, they are making more money,unemployment is at decades low numbers profits are higher. No need for stocks to be lower
2288 2018-12-25 00:03:38 Once they stop raising rates it should level off. Then the stocks that are bargains and solid will be scooped up. There is very few things to invest in. So my guess is it will be crypto for risk and bonds for conservative. When fears are calmed (7 or 8 months) it will be back.
2289 2018-12-25 00:03:34 He was right about stocks 
2290 2018-12-25 00:03:05 Interesting. I think it's more like they have increased interest rates so that people will have more of an incentive to save money in bonds amd banks rather than invest (at risk) in stocks. It's a sound strategy. Their timing sucks, but that doesn't make it wrong.
2291 2018-12-25 00:02:22 Market gani hiyo uncle???? Stocks nn??
2292 2018-12-25 00:02:12 Not at all..only if they sell at below what they bought them for hey..most just hang onto stocks until they rise again of course..and many just rely on the divvy dough anyway..so the price doesn't worry them either way..

2294 2018-12-25 00:01:39 Don’t put it past him to make hurting upper middle class in blue states that save their retirement in stocks: just like the tax bill that limited state and local deductions. And don’t fall for the Trump is too dumb to do evil BS either. Narcissists love the dumb act.

But yeah sometimes I'll play someone hella good and they'll beat my ass n theyre rules are set to 2 stocks, confuses the shit out of me
2300 2018-12-25 00:00:09 The tax cuts had nothing to do with stocks. The market is down partially bc of uncertainty of the tarrifs though. I'm not saying the tariffs are wrong, just stating fact. The bigger reason is the fed raising interest rates with talks of more on the horizon.
