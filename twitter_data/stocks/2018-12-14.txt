1 2018-12-16 23:59:03 Lal well it’s risky though. A lot of the stocks dropped a bunch lately. At first they were through the roof but now not so much. And a lot of people will probably grow their own
2 2018-12-16 23:57:21 welp did my first smash online tourney just now, went 0-2 0-2, first match wasnt the greatest but 2nd match i SD'd when i was up 2-1 in stocks and then he carried the momentum all the way through the next game *shrugs* oh well was really fun and i learned a lot
3 2018-12-16 23:56:54 Some folks lack of understanding of how stocks work truly still amazes me. If you have a 401k then I suggest you go look at it and check how it’s been doin since 2013. And if you’re able to, dump more into it right now and come back and thank me mid 2019.
4 2018-12-16 23:56:22 Bring back the stocks for bullshit like this. Shame on a grown woman who chooses to stay ignorant and hateful. Especially nowadays.

10 2018-12-16 23:48:02 That could happen with stocks that haven’t positives EPS , but for me stocks that are growing EPS +20% every year and with guidance for same growth over the next 2-3 years I can’t just understand the drops like $FNKO. $AMRN $BZUN I also can’t understand this punishment .

50 2018-12-16 23:37:31 Are they leaving #tech stocks as well? Despite the drop in price $BTC has still out performed #Apple since the beginning of the year.
51 2018-12-16 23:34:07 Economy is in ‘good’ condition? My 401 stocks shown zero/minimal growth this year, higher interest rates and (still) higher gas prices. Nice for people to ‘think’-how about we stick to facts.
52 2018-12-16 23:34:03 I thought you drink coffee , didn’t know you can eat coffee . Jim it’s ok the pot stocks your recommend make me high once in a while . I hope he gets better! Give him my love 
53 2018-12-16 23:32:55 As the stocks start tumbling, our respect around the world is nonexistent, as our president faces multiple criminal charges, farmers plant with no clear path to selling their crops, as children cry in tents for their parents, as Russia and China hack our democracy......
54 2018-12-16 23:29:12 So I should stump my shortenings sell off my cash cracks and shore up my new quark stocks. Thanks for the tip buddy.
55 2018-12-16 23:27:43 No one smart wants to buy into stocks wheh they are going down like this = The Market will have a lack of buyers
56 2018-12-16 23:26:49 Please add the environmental argument to the fish stocks.
They are depleted, shifting geographically increasingly polluted, and under real and imminent threat of total collapse. It's happened before in other places.
Fighting for sovereignty on dying seas is short sighted.
57 2018-12-16 23:25:46 I have come to the conclusion that the society thinks that making Gays and Transgenders as laughing stocks already counts as acceptance and when they actually demand for their rights, they're suddenly asking for "too much".
58 2018-12-16 23:24:37 Two more FED tricks: (1) Never saw the low print (tonight), must have blinked (2) Spread trading the ES, NQ. YM to control the all stocks markets simultaneously w/o spending $....been going on for about a year.
59 2018-12-16 23:23:19 Ellen, do you do any individual investing or does someone do that for you? Our site @Stocksinc Dr_Stocks trys to help those who are in need of help who may be in college. Education and learning are key  to investing. You are in a great position to help others. The poor in need
60 2018-12-16 23:22:02 Technological development is taking place at a very rapid pace. Smart investors buy before we arrive at that place. Valuation 1X gold would be $380K, US stocks 0.18 BPS. IT IS beyond Stupid cheap.
61 2018-12-16 23:21:00 You either wait for the VIX to get cheap, or wait for Stocks to get cheap... If they both are not at a price you like, hold your cash

VIX action is showing Stocks are going... DOWN!
62 2018-12-16 23:20:37 Who are you having trouble closing out stocks with?
63 2018-12-16 23:20:25 And another thing..why should we let the EU tell Britain what to do...they rape our fishing stocks and tell us what hours we can work!..fuck them I’ll work whatever hours I want!
64 2018-12-16 23:20:09 I mean, the only way to learn a fighting game is to get destroyed repeatedly. I expect nothing but 3 stocks against my Incineroar.
65 2018-12-16 23:19:58 Or the interesting variant we just saw with Big D vs Kvothe at DPOTG:

Players strike to FD, Big D almost 3-stocks Kvothe
Big D wins game 2 on Kvothe's CP, Smashville
Kvothe takes game 3 on Smashville
Big D, knowing that he wins on FD, picks FD again & 2-stocks Kvothe again

68 2018-12-16 23:17:48 My friend who asked me why he shouldn’t buy bitcoin at 15k asked me this weekend why he should buy stocks if they’re just going to keep going lower. Anecdotal? Yes. But just saying. Caught my ear when he said that.
69 2018-12-16 23:17:12 Exactly. I like copper, silver, $spx, $eem, $eww and energy stocks.

74 2018-12-16 23:14:03 Stocks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me! Oh and Pacific who?
75 2018-12-16 23:11:28 Brawl was 3 stocks, did that a lot during the tail end of that games lifespan too. Melee is 4 stocks, on average takes about the same amount of time and does the same thing, its just what they’re doing now at events where they only host 4-5 games at the most. Usually 2-3
76 2018-12-16 23:10:15 Il ne reste plus d'autres options, IGA maxi et superC , les 3 géants , les autres ont fermés, on peut laisser leurs stocks sur les tablettes certes, ça va se ramasser dans les banques alimentaires de toute façons, mais n'empêche que ça répond pas a des besoins dans la région
77 2018-12-16 23:09:57 taking time between stocks to take a breath and ask myself what just happened usually helps keep my head on the game. you should focus when nothing is happening because starting to focus during the high intensity stuff is very difficult
78 2018-12-16 23:09:04 This will be a telling week for #WallSt .  After looking at the charts, I think we will be lower to flat by weeks end.  The market is slightly over sold...but it could go lower!!! Be carefully there!!!#stocks #StockMarket #weekahead
79 2018-12-16 23:08:44 If it was 2 stocks for this game id understand. Or if only top 8. But thats a lot of matches. Im sure they understand more than me though.
80 2018-12-16 23:00:32 This was the year where bitcoin died. I literally never trade cryptocurrencies because of shit like bitcoin. Never sustainable trades. Stick to stocks/forex/commodities. Bitcoin has no directional bias whatsoever
81 2018-12-16 22:59:59 Oui. “La Nocence, instrument du Grand Remplacement”. Le bras armé de la conquête, c’est la délinquance, la nocence perpétuelle, des pieds sur la banquette du RER au terrorisme. Et les banlieues sont pleines de stocks d’armes.
82 2018-12-16 22:59:48 Spot on @fmcbill. The good news is that gravity applies to all stocks eventually even ones with a unicorn riding CEO. 2018 $TSLA feels a lot like 2017 $BLA and 2016 $QIN. Have a good Xmas
83 2018-12-16 22:59:47 LRT i would buy haltmann stocks,, that seems like a good investment

86 2018-12-16 22:55:57 I remember every time my dad would catch me on my phone he’d ask if I was checking my stocks.... I wish he was still here so I could tell his ass.... yeah, I actually am.
87 2018-12-16 22:53:33 Bring it on. Nice to buy stocks on sale!
88 2018-12-16 22:53:15 Study Christian history. Promoting santa would have been punished. Christmas was a sacred day, no parties, certainly no trees and lights as those are pagan symbols. Colonials were put in the stocks for ignoring these rules
89 2018-12-16 22:51:23 What’s your view? And how it all affects Cannabis stocks?
90 2018-12-16 22:51:12 Have you checked the chart of single stocks? I have the feeling that the index has been weak for Aapl + Financials. Stocks like fb, msft, amzn, goog, adbe (despite the big drop friday), pep, csco, pg, ko, are not bad technically, and have weight.
91 2018-12-16 22:50:00 gee, i wonder if many cabinet members have 'stocks/shares' in kimberly-clark? it's good to diverse investments in various 'companies/manufacturers'-fencing, 'medical & security services' & 'washing $'. oh my, how i can go on. do enjoy your sunday afternoon/evening, dear sir

93 2018-12-16 22:49:31 Bad juju to short stocks days before Christmas.
94 2018-12-16 22:49:20 One under-appreciated and rarely talked about aspect of forex trading is how uncorrelated it is with equity markets.

While everyone is busy predicting the next bear market in stocks, us forex traders are really not affected by any of this.
95 2018-12-16 22:47:35 TWN Stocks: Under the most optimistic estimations, Tatung's (2371大同) real estate holdings are worth $100B NT. This year alone, I'll estimate its losses to be $7B NT - that's like 7% of the value of its real estate holdings.  2019 looks to be even worse.    RUN!
96 2018-12-16 22:47:06 Ofcourse she is, her husband has invested heavily in stocks etc that benefit heavily from Brexit.

98 2018-12-16 22:46:01 I’d say the border wall and lower drug prices are the best part.  I don’t own any stocks but I’m so glad all the people who do made a killing this year.  Oh wait....
99 2018-12-16 22:45:59 Well I do agree.  There is a big difference between how stocks are behaving and what's going on with individuals.  For instance I bought my first shares in early 2009 and was ecstatic about buying bank of America for single digits and ford for 2 while everyone was freaking out.
100 2018-12-16 22:45:39 With our moronic government, I wouldn't be surprised. And then our fish stocks would be ruined in a couple of years and the entire industry would collapse.

GAME!
105 2018-12-16 22:41:05 It is very expensive to bring a drug to market.  So many fail. Is the government go to reimburse the failed meds?  No so a lot of the cost is for research and litigation.  Most biotechs don’t even make any money for years if the product gets approved.  I follow the stocks.
106 2018-12-16 22:39:18 Right it’s definitely a long game. I have done a little trading but even on a trade I didn’t buy anything that I wouldn’t be ok with holding for the next 10-15 years. I’m pretty much done with trading though because I have looked at where certain stocks are now vs the trade.
107 2018-12-16 22:39:09 I'm assuming you own tons of stocks. If this is so you would know  that a President really has little to do with the markets. What he says or does can fluctuate it. But market forces are not tied to an administration.
108 2018-12-16 22:38:44 $MLHC This stock at a low price now and having a lot of diversity along with an aggressive attitude to get it done is well worth the risk for a spiraling upwards reward .......The wild west of penny stocks.....don't you just love it......
109 2018-12-16 22:37:33 My thought on stocks and the economy? The drop isn’t telling us as much about the economy as we think (but that’s probably also true about the prior years run up)

111 2018-12-16 22:36:46 I literally just did an online doubles match where my team had 2 stocks and the other team had 3. Wtf??
112 2018-12-16 22:36:43 Smart signal to notice when bear markets are over, stocks jump on bad news.
113 2018-12-16 22:35:48 TWN Stocks:  Tatung's (2371 大同) dramatic decline in sales looks to be terminal.  Methinks its 2018 4Q loss will be staggering - easily -$1.30.    Meaning that after it announces its 4Q earnings, its book value goes below $10, and Tatung's stock transactions goes COD (全額交割)!
114 2018-12-16 22:35:41 Stocks with RS Line @ NH increasing for the fourth week in a row now. Those are 6, 19, 39, and 48 this week

118 2018-12-16 22:32:34 I started moving into cash on November 9, 2016. By the beginning of 2018 I was mostly in cash. Some bargain hunting in dividend stocks this year. No plans to get back in.
119 2018-12-16 22:31:10 or it could be a move out of stocks and into yield inst after 10 years of zero rates.  re-balance - we'll see in a few months.

131 2018-12-16 22:20:54 Look at the effect that the CAP and CFP, still the largest items in the EU Budget, have had in both misallocating resources and undermining primary producers outside the EU. The CFP has also had the curious effect of running down fish stocks so much EU is now dependent on imports
132 2018-12-16 22:18:55 Ive played smash once but I think playing a 4 player stocks match w 10 stocks on the boxing ring stage was one of the most painful things I’ve experienced
133 2018-12-16 22:18:42 To be fair.. it's probably because neither you or the peeps you're betting can afford to pony up a million bucks prior to either the stocks or crypto rising. But I will bet $100 that crypto will be the better investment.. any takers
134 2018-12-16 22:18:03 The issue is they’re both trying to break into markets that are already heavily saturated. Camila’s nut milk is not unique, every single supermarket stocks Alpro products etc and Sian’s swimwear is not unique enough to be that overpriced...  #TheApprentice

138 2018-12-16 22:12:03 Of course. I just think you should be aware of the idiosyncratic risks of investing in RE.

And the chances of going wrong w/ RE is definitely higher than bonds and slightly lower than stocks. (This one isn’t my opinion)

143 2018-12-16 22:01:50 $CAT seems like a very weird choice unless we finally have Infrastructure Week. I'm always scared of going into cyclical stocks late in the business cycle. Good way to get burned if you are even slightly wrong in your timing.
144 2018-12-16 22:01:01  you are wildly successful in business, you have an amazing personal life, your presence on social media is undeniable. Keep selling that. Glenn investor  Yeah OK.  Dalio, Buffet and Tudor Jones are fascinated by “pot” stocks and trolling Trump appointees on the web.
145 2018-12-16 21:55:36 From a results standpoint and in terms of dollars, who has benefitted most from the last 20 years of the wars on terror? At this point, I think America could use some freedom from public debt, but I see arms manufacturers stocks rise and rise. And are we more free?

153 2018-12-16 21:50:32 1/ I'd stay away from individual stocks until you can afford to lose. Before your dream car make sure you are contributing to a Roth IRA and have a no load mutual fund, Even if you could own 1 share for $360, it going up would be pretty meaningless profit (& don't forget tax)

171 2018-12-16 21:36:57 Blockchain bill. Blockchain tech powered by tokenized "access" is a different business model that could be more secure and cheaper for services. The US dollar won't go anywhere and digital currencies will be like the stock market of today. Your average Joe doesn't buy stocks.
172 2018-12-16 21:36:25 I agree. It took 17 years for tech stocks to recover after the dot com bubble. I don’t think crypto has hit this level of boom and bust for the next cycle to be that far away. 2-5 years away though is possible.
173 2018-12-16 21:33:33 Good point. Only free men should bear arms. Certainly not slaves. Only free white men who know how to use bump stocks.

205 2018-12-16 20:59:18 I fear that stocks of the ebola vaccine are running low, and that new production won't keep up with demand.  I have not been able to find much about this angle.  Have you Mark?
206 2018-12-16 20:58:40 Yes and an argument can be made that lower rate expectations can be good for stocks too... market will make that call.
207 2018-12-16 20:56:32 Y vos, de que los créditos se pagan con el FLUJO de ingresos, no vendiendo stocks (activos). Argumento más absurdo, no creo que haya... aunque @lucasllach siempre se supera, a la hora de hacer el ridículo.
208 2018-12-16 20:56:08 That’s a null point, I’m subscribed to Ronnie for crypto purposes only - so it’s 5% of my crypto investment.

214 2018-12-16 20:47:58 I'm unsure on a proper View on US health care stocks. 
Obviously a sector with forever demand in an aging population. 

My concern is a government crackdown on health care expenses to control the deficit. Does anyone see this risk as consensus or priced in?
215 2018-12-16 20:45:54 First I’m ctfu at the comments below but anyway. Girl, open an investment portfolio and invest into cannabis stocks it’s a billion dollar industry.... then u get more money to buy & smoke weed and the capital will keep rolling in 4 u. Win win.

230 2018-12-16 20:33:04 Idk. 

Monthly dividend stocks 
Education (no schools)
Franchise 
Duplexes/triplexes/residential homes
Air bnb 

That's prob the order right would go too since I'm starting with lower capital and they are all lower risk in each tier. I'll test it out and come back in 5yrs to this

236 2018-12-16 20:27:40 My understanding is that in anticipation of yield curve inversion, investors are pulling money from bank stocks as it will make offering long terms loans money-losing, so banks will stop making the loans, then business, buyers can’t get loans and economic activity slows. True?

252 2018-12-16 20:11:35 #trade Trade Detente-Fueled Rally Fades Amid Weak China Data: EM Review

(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market stocks and currencies slid as disappointing economic data from China reinforced concerns about the outlook for global growth, outweighing positive trade developments.
253 2018-12-16 20:11:32 Yes, many opportunities/reasons for stocks to rally... and they have not.  

Concerning.

255 2018-12-16 20:05:37 Are we sure that it’s not the other way around? 

Can indexing be “right” or “wrong?” It just “is” (exposure to stocks at any price) and now free. 

But free can be expensive.

259 2018-12-16 20:02:57 My opinion about OTC stocks is alot of them go through a cycle or may have a shelf-life so to speak, i've seen many that looked like piles when no one wanted them end up running multi-thousands of percent, Im a trader so I personally trade ticker symbols and ignore all the noise.
260 2018-12-16 20:02:07 Perhaps the Trump effect with all its money laundering has come to light bringing stocks to where they are now.
261 2018-12-16 20:01:47 Trump's corruption and incompetence are sending stocks, bonds and commodity prices tumbling:

- Investors flee US stocks.

- Wall Street has worst December start since 1980.

- Recession fears are mounting

271 2018-12-16 19:55:44 2019 is when America will feel the true weight of Trump’s incompetence, as his tariffs cause prices to rise and layoffs to increase, his failed trade policies cause stocks to fall, and healthcare is taken away from millions and becomes unaffordable to millions more.
272 2018-12-16 19:54:02 Korean Stocks: And Samsung Biologics (207940.KS) is #7 on the KOSPI index?   A crooked son implies a crooked family (Samsung itself).   You know what?   I'd avoid the KOSPI altogether 'cause all Korean companies are alike.   RUN!

275 2018-12-16 19:49:52 Korean Stocks:  Samsung Biologics (207940.KS) is ...valuation.   A POS with $410M (2017) in sales, money losing core bidness, is given a valuation of 56x sales, or $22.9B market cap.    Really?    It's like printing money.   Of course I'm gonna fruad you all the way.

I don’t think it’s likely, but that would (once again) prove it’s really hard to predict the markets

310 2018-12-16 19:22:59 Sir John Templeton used to put limit buy orders on stocks he loved way below the prevailing prices. When asked why he said that if they ever actually got that low his emotions would prevent him from putting the order in for the stock.

320 2018-12-16 19:12:57 Yes, as I pointed out in several posts last wk, the intraday moves are much bigger these days and are ideal for day trading.  I am merely pointing out that the volatility makes option prices elevated (more expensive), and stocks obv don’t have this issue.

My reasons for buying stocks are not because stocks have always continued to rise (they haven't).

382 2018-12-16 18:17:53 Why do you assume that it is stocks when one is talking about a financial crash?

I am long US stocks because relative basis US is in a much better shape than the rest of the world. And just like in 1997, crisis elsewhere (which is what I expect) will push money to US

390 2018-12-16 18:06:43 #stocks Massive liquidation is coming. This may come in the guise of deflationary depression OR hyperinflation.  The current and rising mountain of debt cannot be serviced.  FED is in a cul de sac, partly of its own making.
391 2018-12-16 18:05:25 If the stocks had risen there'd be no need for us to point out why the sector has such good long term prospects
392 2018-12-16 18:03:49 United now need a major overhaul. If not, we will continue being the laughing stocks.

395 2018-12-16 18:01:35 this has been a club run on business not on football.. the owners just looking at the business side and as long as the stocks are up and the money is coming in.. everything is fine for Ed and the owners smh

401 2018-12-16 17:59:29 Marijuana stocks = dogs. Already so much Canadian over production product is being dumped. So much competition, there will much more losers than winners & margins will be slim.  Prices for product will drop like stones because no more black market. No single Amazon will arise.
402 2018-12-16 17:58:28 It’s going to be a good tussle tomorrow between the bulls and the bears. I would be inclined towards saying bulls have the upper hand if not for the volatility being so low in such a downtrending market. Time will tell #stockstowatch #Stocks #money #WallStreet
403 2018-12-16 17:54:42 I was looking at the veteran car buying service and it's a great service but it's really a shame that big companies like @Honda , @VolvoCarUSA, @BMWUSA aren't doing more here. Maybe this could help move some of those plug-in stocks that are piling. Even resales are dreadful
404 2018-12-16 17:50:37 Which investment is feasible? Finding the best profit making stocks among thousands of listed plc, which stand for roughly 4% of winners and 96% losers. Or cash flow generating rental property? I think I will prefer one with higher probability anytime.

409 2018-12-16 17:47:17 Well, if your buying stocks you better be thinking of the future and the potential for best case and worst case.  If not, we should be playing gold all day, doing water color paintings of fruit bowls, or watch reruns of syncronized swimming endlessly.  We dont daydream here.
410 2018-12-16 17:46:29 To each their own. I don't think I could hold through the stock markets next a 50pc drawdown with a 100pc allocation to stocks. Can't imagine trying to survive the next bear market on margin or with borrowed money.
411 2018-12-16 17:45:16 You can’t say “investing is risky” is you have a 401k lol. You literally are investing into stocks & bonds with a company match.

414 2018-12-16 17:41:29 Also, indexes tend to be less volatile that individual stocks.
415 2018-12-16 17:40:38 I personally don't invest in alcohol and cigarette stocks. But, am ok with investing in pharma. Some people argue with me that due to commissions to doctors, even pharma sector is unethical. So, ethics is subjective. We can invest in companies in which we are comfortable with.
416 2018-12-16 17:40:28 Do you know when the president will sign the farm Bill? Also when it is signed do you think it will make much difference to any pot stocks ?
417 2018-12-16 17:40:01 However, noticed that a lot of these stocks tend to go into consolidation at such levels and hence the MA catches up. Instead of straight up shorting them, found it better to short OTM options or put in ratio trades, they seem to better serve the purpose.

421 2018-12-16 17:34:52 Article reflects the current mood, and thus is highly supportive of the opposite view since at bottoms, this is NOT what you see.  It's been clear to me since Feb 2nd that we are in a bear market. Just taking a while for US buyers to recognize QT is highly negative for stocks
422 2018-12-16 17:34:44 The world has changed since the 50s. Information flows much faster, companies are made and broken in hours instead of weeks, and the volatility of even the larger stocks (See Boeing, Tesla, etc) show that focusing on trends from the last 60 years will leave you broke.

426 2018-12-16 17:31:17 Two stocks not to buy.  These are glorified gypsy cab companies with terrible relations with their driver work force.

428 2018-12-16 17:29:40 And VA Linux Systems extended an invitation to me to participate in their IPO (read: buy the stock). I don't think I directly contributed to anything that they open sourced.

In both cases there sure was robust interest in buying those new stocks at the IPO price, wasn't there?

439 2018-12-16 17:22:04 It is interesting Pete that you note pt 12.  The real interesting thing for someone that lived 2007 and played the stocks at the time and are seeing the 2019+ set up is this one will NOT be short lived.  '07 was a spike up and then essentially the same down.  However, Mike is
440 2018-12-16 17:22:02 This dude sounds like someone who “stocks shelves” for a living. Sad.
441 2018-12-16 17:21:40 What harm has @POTUS caused? All I see is GDP 4%, lowest unemployment for women, African Americans, Hispanics, Caucasian’s, gas prices dropping, more jobs available than people on unemployment,lowest people on food stamps, stocks all time highs! Yea, you are NOT A TRUE PATRIOT!
442 2018-12-16 17:21:28 If it hasn't been tried yet, I'd like to try it out and see what happens. It's not impossible to play around, and other games have meter and comeback mechanics. More stocks means more opportunities to not instantly lose, and they're hype moments. If meter warps meta then dont use

454 2018-12-16 17:13:23 Shocked that nobody took you up on some ill-defined decade long bet...."stocks" vs.  "crypto"...what does that even mean?  What's the objective measurement?  Dumb bet.
455 2018-12-16 17:13:19 Other than that, my placement is the worst I've ever had at a local, lmao. Guess my day 2 Marth and day 1 Ike didn't quite cut it :P
But it can only get better from here. In a crew battle I felt more confident and took 7 stocks, which made me the MVP :P
456 2018-12-16 17:12:41 #Stocks typically rise in December, but this month has proved to be an anomaly. All three major U.S. stock indexes are down 5.5% or more, their worst starts to December since 1980, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

461 2018-12-16 17:10:17 Forcing entries, not cutting losses fast, not taking profits is why only 1 in 10 traders succeeds. Crypto is not magical. It is traded by same creatures as stocks and OTCs - human beings. Penny stocks have gone up over 2,000% in a day or 10,000% in a year, too.

467 2018-12-16 17:05:31 Looked back at this period re the yield curve. The curve inverted in early 2006 n stayed that way into 2007 then came out mid-yr. During this period I noticed that preferred stocks n funds w good dividends rallied until the financial system cracked n we got the everything crash.

475 2018-12-16 16:56:35 WOW!!! When you’re behind of the Info and you’re catching up! Mind blowing!! Boom! I remember when I worked at a large company “Marriott” and in late 2008 an Executive dumped his stocks and I thought that was odd. Then 2009 happened and the rest is history 
476 2018-12-16 16:55:52 Have lost more than 20lacs in stocks but getting motivated to do better from tomorrow.. will follow the right strategy as envisioned! Wait, watch trend and grab!
477 2018-12-16 16:55:21 Have been trading stocks for years now so I do know it can turn. It’s just my sentiment at the moment to not care about the tech. Not selling XRP, just don’t care except to see the losses regained.

497 2018-12-16 16:36:47 We have been advocating the return of the stocks for many years now, there is a law on the statue books from 1406 whereby any town will be downgraded to a village if it does not have a set of public stocks. The increase in sales will aid the stock market. #Manicfesto
498 2018-12-16 16:36:38 I assume your S&P prediction factors in a Fed hike this week? What if they don't hike? Do you think we'd see stocks knee jerk higher and than make new lows?
499 2018-12-16 16:35:52 Yep. Ask Rep. Chris Collins who has been indicted for insider trading. I think all federal elected positions should be required to put any stocks, bonds, etc. in a blind trust. Period.

Very interesting fact: all oil stocks (xom, BP..) were plummeting where as RIL was pretty stable. Retail is a looser like no other, Jio is sucking up money. Still ambu thrives.

625 2018-12-16 14:48:59 The fact that stocks fluctuate in value makes them both “risky” and “safe” at the same time. 

They are risky in the fact that if your holding period is not sufficient to weather a storm you may be forced to sell at a loss...

636 2018-12-16 14:39:07 Not sure who owns it. Depends if owning a company means you need to shut it down because you want to move abroad. Considering he gets most of his wealth from property I suspect he does very little with the other companies other than just owning stocks.
637 2018-12-16 14:38:19 Why don’t you reveal your AUDITED performance and AUM? Seems like you are always long only stocks that are up.

643 2018-12-16 14:34:01 The biggest risk to wealth creation is the current trend nationalism and merkantilism economically

WW1 wasn’t that bad for stocks, at least not in the US. Germany was a different matter
644 2018-12-16 14:33:46 Won't they think finally: Maybe easing has actually caused ever bigger stocks boom / bust cycles? Accept they are part of the problem? Better to hold rates at 2%, do nothing.
645 2018-12-16 14:32:20 Seems like there are better opportunities in the market than shorting it. Would make sense if you think yields on treasuries or Corp bonds will raise enough to cause a serious (therefore worthwhile) decline in stocks. Not sure what your thesis is given persisting low inflation
646 2018-12-16 14:31:45 Assuming of course we can get them through customs quick enough and they meet our quality standards. Not sure our car manufacturers will be that happy about having to wait for JIT stocks. They will move to the EU if it becomes too hard.
647 2018-12-16 14:31:38 No, creo que muchos de los problemas que nos trajeron hasta acá están en camino de resolverse: rumbo a equilibrio fiscal, cero financiamiento monetario al Tesoro, se dio vuelta el "comerse stocks" de infraestructura, ganado, reservas, tipo de cambio competitivo...
648 2018-12-16 14:31:17 Wala pa stocks ko huhu
649 2018-12-16 14:30:07 In stock markets, prices are always close to uniform. But that isn't because stocks are the same everywhere, it's because technology has made markets efficient. They weren't that way when American brokers got their London prices by boat.
650 2018-12-16 14:30:03 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
651 2018-12-16 14:29:44 I seriously don't know how the j&j still selling their baby powder when their investors hands are dipped in innocent blood. Even mozes would have been sick to his stomach if he knew.

654 2018-12-16 14:28:22 Ugh. Gold is a stock vs flow phenom.  Ugh, now we are talking about population growth in Sri Lanka and Egypt (Chindia?) and that buying of gold vs local FX is driving force behind 2K Au? JFC... gold fund managers suffering same disease as CEOs. Pick stocks / run mines. STFU
655 2018-12-16 14:28:19 Also the Clinton Cartel owns stocks in media companies
656 2018-12-16 14:27:09 @realDonaldTrump MAGA. What a joke!  Not only are stocks in the garbage, oil is scraping the bottom of the barrel, foreign relations are in the toilet, and suicide is at an all time high, but you remain the boorish, racist, mysogynist bigot that you’ve always been. Please quit.
657 2018-12-16 14:27:07 Brokers can’t recommend clients buy an ETF unless it’s on “approved list”. Some major firms won’t even allow clients to buy unsolicited. Why? Brokers can recommend a single stock which is much riskier than a basket of stocks. It’s so the firms can push their products. #paytoplay
658 2018-12-16 14:26:29 Just curious, when is Doug kass accountable for what he says or writes?he has said to short the S&P essentially every weeks since late 2009 til he covered near the top a few months ago where he got super long bank stocks and bought all the way down. he talks smack about others?
659 2018-12-16 14:26:19 The mothman is a foreteller of dooms and misfortune. He is also very rich, a beneficiary of a dozen offshore accounts, for the disasters are not just for flesh and stone, but of decimals and stocks, and he has shorted every crash since '32.

663 2018-12-16 14:23:23 Also must mention a #FF for @HCPG. A must follow even if like me you don't trade stocks. All around a huge positive addition to your TWTR stream.
664 2018-12-16 14:22:06 I look forward to reading your article. I loathed Hitchens in the end. If he'd had an ounce of integrity he would have praised the Vatican rather than condemned it for meeting with Tariq Aziz who was trying to convince the world Iraq had destroyed its banned WMD stocks.
665 2018-12-16 14:20:30 Jameela is a kitsune who trades stocks as a hobby.
666 2018-12-16 14:19:57 Long rates have very little impact on stocks when rates are below 6-7%
667 2018-12-16 14:19:18 Ideally get it up to 5 stocks for some diversification of risk. These should cover various sectors ie industrails (maybe BVT, MND, BTI), financials (banks pay good divs), large cap resources (BHP, AGL, GLN), property (also good div maybe GRT), large cap retailers (WHL, SHP, SPP).
668 2018-12-16 14:16:53 That it's written when stocks are basically unchanged on the year speaks to a certain measure of entitlement.

675 2018-12-16 14:12:32 Yep I agree there is a risk they know something we don’t but it seems worth taking to me. Short interest in all the US gaming stocks also increased substantially over last couple of months. I’m wondering whether it is because of the Fornite ‘phenomenon’...

705 2018-12-16 13:41:51 Just to add to this, even if btc is the only currency and money left, people will still speculate on its price.

728 2018-12-16 13:19:58 Descent thread. I have been a trader for 8 years or so (Forex, Stocks, Metals, Indices, a bit of Crypto), trading is tough, didn't really break even until the 4th year, and two more years after that of ups and down before I could steady the ship and correctly position risk
729 2018-12-16 13:19:22 Times like these we need to bring back the stocks to the public square, and clap such low lifes in them for all the world to see. Time to return to public shaming. Unbelievable that any decent person could write such filth to ANY other human being ever
730 2018-12-16 13:19:09 I agree that long term trend is a better bet. Only HOW long is still a question. 

I personally, prefer a weekly TF for trading & the trend of quarterly results for investing. 

Stocks are TOTAL slaves of results in a longer time frame. I'm bearish after Q2 as results are bad.
731 2018-12-16 13:15:35 Most stocks are already down 20-30% let’s just say $SPX drops another 10% that would mean most stock would have sold off 40-60% .... this is the bottom or this is the half way mark

737 2018-12-16 13:01:40 I asked the “when” question because it is their taking out and putting back in large amoubts of money in certain stocks that CAUSES the stocks to move up and down. Not the other way around.

764 2018-12-16 12:21:30 Obamacare was the biggest insurance scam in history. It was designed to destroy business and middle class America.
As insurance analysts, and actuaries we shook our heads in disbelief, ACA passed? We ran out and bought insurance company stocks, which went from 30 to 300%.

789 2018-12-16 12:02:13 Exactly! That is why said true blood. There is not point in entering once it is a part of Twitter investors portfolio. In fact in many stocks that social media investors capture, big boys are not even there. A stock will remain a multibagger when big boys want it to be that way.
790 2018-12-16 12:02:04 Hahaha! I always go to malls sa opening where stocks are maayos and sina ate sales are smiling pa lol

793 2018-12-16 11:58:28 @Abhishekkar_ great learning content on your channel. A quick question: why do you trade in futures over stocks? Any particular reason?
794 2018-12-16 11:58:01 being at 150%+ vs snake is fucking scary but i somehow managed to come back from being 2 stocks down. mostly by being really fucking careful and taking advantage of this guy just spamming grenades.
795 2018-12-16 11:56:46 You expect stocks like $amzn $fb to rally into next week ? I don’t know if mainstream media is right sometimes when it comes to stocks in comparison to crypto
796 2018-12-16 11:55:04 Sir, the explanation:
major factors that affect demand for stocks are economic data, interest rate and corporate results.
While demand for a stock can gyrate based on market dynamics, economic conditions, changes to central bank policy and better than expected corporate results
797 2018-12-16 11:54:49 I think the newsagent on the Royal Mile opp St Giles stocks international newspapers the day after publication. Worth giving them a call

806 2018-12-16 11:39:27 "As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens a diversified portfolio of equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates." @InvestecClick

810 2018-12-16 11:34:16 Some #API stocks are so thinly traded and just 50-60 Cr market cap that I can’t name them (don’t want people to jump in willy-nilly). This theme would definitely play out over the next few years but trust me this is not like a perma bull #diageo #dabur or #HUL type!!
811 2018-12-16 11:27:03 That sounds like a great idea. Thanks, will try that out as well.
812 2018-12-16 11:27:02 That is not easy to say. If market goes full risk off it likely won't matter what commodities do, at least at first. If markets don't crash and commodities rally then in theory stocks with exposure to those commodities should benefit.

817 2018-12-16 11:23:04 Consider looking at stocks, bonds, gold, and cryptocurrencies.
818 2018-12-16 11:19:54 Not everyone got into crypto being a trader. I never bought stocks before getting into crypto. I have learned a lot this year...but I was buying the dip all year when I should have been selling on the rally early in the year...of course now I have a much better understanding
819 2018-12-16 11:19:03 Why would even a mid-size RIA pay more than about 35bp to own stocks I can easily buy directly? The niche issuer's challenge is finding something that enough RIAs want to buy but have difficulty accessing. I'd argue far more of these assets are unlisted (including fixed income).
820 2018-12-16 11:17:26 So the mining explorer stocks will follow the commodities?
821 2018-12-16 11:17:21 People can believe what they want, and that's fine.  But this guy stocks his pubs with the most appalling propaganda leaflets. The lies are aimed at those he assumes are too stupid to research further - the same people whose money he takes. No respect there.

Focus on your gr8 trades, study & build on them.
Too much can go wrong on bad trades to actually identify 1 cause to improve these trades. (It was bad, probably in numerous ways)
If you've had no good trades...study stocks that have recently moved & build from there.

862 2018-12-16 10:18:29 Enjoyed the podcast, as always. However, think you are a little too focused on resource stocks taking much of brunt of a bear market. Truth is any growth stocks will get hit hard if they do not deliver & esp if the begging bowl comes out. Main msg is correct though -patience!

864 2018-12-16 10:15:04 Aren’t you ignoring Oke’s point here? Resource stocks have been suffering for a long while now. Yes, people have played SOME juniors well, but the amount spent in exploration/acquisition has been dropping since 2011.
865 2018-12-16 10:14:31 I just played a shitty FFA online and the game took two stocks from one death. What the fuck.
866 2018-12-16 10:13:52 Comes back to having a stop loss in mind before even buying the investment. By not having one you are left with the dilemma of ‘if I sell now after a big fall then markets will recover and I’ll miss out’. But prices can keep getting lower and cheaper - even for quality stocks.
867 2018-12-16 10:12:53 Haha I had a discussion with one of them, he said the only things with value are stocks, fiat and gold.

891 2018-12-16 09:14:40 Obvious reversal pattern, double bottom on the 1hr time frame taking out the previous LH. great entry point for a bid up although there was divergence in the us stocks which suggest this reversal may be short lived.

China population=1.4 billion. You are basing population size to macroeconomic decisions? Wrong!

Norway has oil, invests in its energy, tourism, fishery & sells + uses the revenues to invest in productive stocks like Apple, global funds & other Nations.

Nigeria=JJC
897 2018-12-16 09:05:36 Thank you. I was looking for generic formula or indicator rather than stock specific in the case such an event occurs for other stocks.
898 2018-12-16 09:03:04 The UK will have to renegotiate its quota of total allowable catches for stocks that are shared with the EU and neighbouring countries. The majority of fish caught by UK fleets are exported, mostly to EU member states.

910 2018-12-16 08:48:19 A persons psychology can be easily defeated in a time line of 10-15 yrs of no performance. People question in between whether they are in the right profession (stocks or gold or real estate) So just beware of 100 and 200 yrs of data. It can easily be an illusion.

912 2018-12-16 08:44:50 Is there any way to do leveraged plays on any of the hemp related stocks? Warrants I guess if they have them? I haven't seen any options available for any from the ones I've looked at 
913 2018-12-16 08:44:24 What if you were born in 1900 and you invested in stocks from 1920. Would you have the patience to withstand for 30 yrs? These hypothetical data is good for marketing equities but not necessarily right. Investing life span is 30 yrs, no use quoting 200 yrs data.
914 2018-12-16 08:44:00 Risky time for UK stocks.. I took my losses ten days ago and hold 80% cash... not going in again until Corbyn  shows his hand... biggest risk is a general election in my view and it is a significant threat in this chaos ... just saying
915 2018-12-16 08:41:53 Got it. How do u find out the tradable stocks? By gainers/loser? Catalyst?

919 2018-12-16 08:37:51 I don‘t like seeing people lose money, and I don’t like seeing stocks print lower lows. But this is the reality. If you still don‘t have a plan and are just ostriching (burying your head in the sand and hoping for the best) then you might as well bend over and pick up the soap.
920 2018-12-16 08:37:44 Synchronized buying and selling between various accounts, coordinated attacks on stocks and coordinated selling in case off good news to keep SP from rising? Not talking about private investors but the large HFs. Authorities are too incompetent to reveal it...
921 2018-12-16 08:36:55 You only project negativity this is from my personal experience with you when stocks go in negative you tweet when they are in positive despite of me reminding you you run away with your tail between your legs
922 2018-12-16 08:36:54 That already happens, we cannot improve our welfare standards above those of EU farmers who are a major voting block. Think Danish bacon. The cod stocks plummeted because we cannot protect U.K. stocks.
923 2018-12-16 08:36:29 We see the same thing in mining exploration stocks all the time. When it turns out the grade means the cost of extraction exceeds the potential revenue, the project collapses. Best of intentions, high hopes, yada yada. Doesn't work. Move on.

“Something Is Wrong Here”: U.S. Stocks Plunge Again And Are Having Their Worst Quarter In 7 Years
By: PatriotRising
And no one seems to understand why?  Well, that's the way it goes in gambling casinos.
927 2018-12-16 08:26:14 You do understand the bear market doesn't end until people stop thinking that. In 2009 in stocks NOBODY wanted to buy. NOBODY thought it was great value. People were ecstatic not to be involved.
928 2018-12-16 08:19:40 my take: Fed raises rates, stocks sell off, and major indices negative for 2018.. unless this trade war gets some more miracle articles from the WSJ
929 2018-12-16 08:16:28 I'm keeping ie holding most of my stocks because I know there is no real true recession on the horizon. No real true recession exists in 2019. #artificialintelligence #horizons #really #stocks #holding
930 2018-12-16 08:13:31 y’en a ils sont stocks comme the rock et ils sont même pas capable de protéger leur petite sœur
931 2018-12-16 08:11:05 I have so many stocks at my fridge
932 2018-12-16 08:08:08 for quitters?  Compulsory classes on international finance and economics.  If you fail the final exam.  You're put in stocks in Westminster Square for a peod of time, not exceeding 8 hours.  Yep, it's got legs, I'll mention it to Rayner.
933 2018-12-16 08:07:39 Isn't it the same case in all financial markets? Let's say, intrinsic value of a stock is 100$. That doesn't mean it is gonna trade at 100$ naturally if there isn't anyone to buy at that price. When in bullrun, most stocks are overvalued. How does that happen?
934 2018-12-16 08:06:11 RT DiMartinoBooth: RT gubbmintcheese: DiMartinoBooth Doctored stats in China and Saudi buying of stocks to boost the market. It's all optics management.. and it ends poorly.
935 2018-12-16 08:02:19 What are these rulesets LOL just ran into a DK with 2 stocks 3 mins and then a Dark Samus with 3 stocks 4 mins afterwards

937 2018-12-16 07:57:09 Tons of paid groups out there for everything- penny stocks, weed stocks, commodities, sports betting, etc. to single out crypto paid groups in narrow in sight. Most suck, some will be good - as in everything else
938 2018-12-16 07:56:47 Dm me if you wanna make serious money, not this bullshit scam shit. I trade forex and stocks for a living. Don’t tag me in this survey shit.
939 2018-12-16 07:56:35 I love 3 stocks in Ultimate
940 2018-12-16 07:54:49 I just invested $5 towards cannabis stocks
941 2018-12-16 07:54:25 Instead, we should buy more of his stocks.
942 2018-12-16 07:50:58 While O was in office, the Fed pumped BILLIONS PER MONTH into the money supply -- that's why the market rallied while the real economy was still stagnant (Primary Dealers used that liquidity to buy stocks).  Fed is now DRAINING billions per month.  It's 180 degrees reversed.
943 2018-12-16 07:50:33 Supermarkets stopped holding "back-up stocks" years ago. They've gone the "just in time" route.
944 2018-12-16 07:48:49 Avec mon Samus jte prend 1v1 2 stocks df sans objets easy passe ton CA... oh wait

947 2018-12-16 07:42:59 Ok let me clear this up for y'all because I wasn't trying to get a rise out of anyone:
1. I'm not a melee fanboy. I actually prefer watching Sm4sh's tourneys for the better variety of viable characters.
2. I meant fast stocks not fast games. Sm4sh only uses 2 stocks for a reason.
948 2018-12-16 07:41:27 I almost JV 5’d a dude while visiting a buddy in Colorado. He only hit me on the last stock sadly. Never have I seen a man turn from Alpha Chad to sad in 4 stocks flat
949 2018-12-16 07:35:11 In commodities, there are cases where prices rise suddenly as has been seen in some in India over the last few yrs. Argument for these stocks is that govt. had anti dumping duties on them and they will be protected. (1/n)
950 2018-12-16 07:34:35 The price / book of #em is 1/2 ?
Where is this data from of its correct. Which stocks or index ?

953 2018-12-16 07:30:26 Yeah you cute but what do you want to invest in? Are you interested in stocks? What financial milestones are you interested in for this upcoming year?
954 2018-12-16 07:28:55 thanks! Year of Ox ie 2021 is often bull market for Hong Kong stocks. So thats consistent with the past. Maybe early@2021 is good entry point
955 2018-12-16 07:21:12 I'll post some of the more creative setups later but fair up b is true and pretty amazing if you have a lead/are on even stocks. Nair > fair > up b is a thing too but it's a little more difficult to get.
956 2018-12-16 07:20:29 I’m going to fight you, @Joecrafts123.

Smash Bros. Ultimate. Any omega stage. Three stocks.
957 2018-12-16 07:18:56 There are many journals one can publish with which do not extort universities but academics don’t take such outside options because it is self defeating: their market value depends on this very bad equilibrium. It’s like holding stocks in a stock market you are unhappy with.
958 2018-12-16 07:18:21 The difference between Australia and the US is our "laughing stock" memes revolve around stock cubes and the American ones revolve around stocks you shove into a gun. I wonder why that is 
959 2018-12-16 07:14:29 I saw this play out the same way with so many stocks the past 2 months

962 2018-12-16 07:05:05 If they’re going to sell shares because they are bored or unexcited they’ll be 100x more likely to get bored with bonds. However if they are so inclined, bond ETFs would work fine. I’d give them the choice of three consumer stocks. Ask them to pick one and hold it in your name.
963 2018-12-16 07:03:30 Sing to yourself, laugh, whistle or hum a tune -- that raises endorphin & dopamine levels the same as a short jog would do. Second, as I said ... start REAL small & accomplish something (tape $5 to your mirror-think how to make it $10 - stocks RARELY double in value).

968 2018-12-16 06:53:25 ACA dramatically slowed the rate of increase of healthcare costs.

Don't want to believe me? Believe my stock portfolio. Nearly 40% of my holdings are in healthcare stocks. I fully expect record returns on Monday. Why? Profits will soar if this ruling stands (which it won't).
969 2018-12-16 06:53:01 Indeed, some of our property stocks could come under pressure on the back of this, looks like the edcon days are coming to an end
970 2018-12-16 06:50:34 Careful. That might be a buff to the guy in the lead overall. Suddenly the dude who's at 200% with 3 stocks to your 1 can do all his low percent damage strings before dying since you don't go as far anymore.

Maybe not dying at 60% to rage when behind ever feels better to you tho
971 2018-12-16 06:49:16 "dans les limites des stocks disponibles" tout s'est épuisé très rapidement du coup oui ^^ je l'ai moi-même récupéré dans l'heure de sa mise à disposition gratuite, premiers arrivés premiers servis

977 2018-12-16 06:36:23 So Damon Green quickly found a new gig after getting the arse from Zach! Ollie's stocks for 2019, after a mediocre 2nd half of 2018, are surely on the rise.
978 2018-12-16 06:34:46 Both are important... Riding the trend in good fundamental stocks is key to create wealth. See the lomg teem monthly chart of titan, hdfc bank and Bajaj finance you will understand.

988 2018-12-16 06:20:47 2019 is the year I really start investing in stocks

998 2018-12-16 06:02:49 @RBX_Coeptus Please, just please add investing as a job, it would be realistic and it would require actual company stocks (i.e. Pizza planet, Gaz blox) and you can sell when the stocks are high etc it would be a nice source of income without being afk
999 2018-12-16 06:00:56 $HAIN WTH happened here?! This was one of my fave stocks post Great Recession. Thinking of buying at the open for a technical bounce to 20.
1000 2018-12-16 06:00:14 They are lining their pockets somehow??  Make more people sick,  pharmaceuticals stocks go up.?  I'm guessing here.

A bit like the detention centres owners. Trump detains. Owner's make money. 

Plus he hates Obamacare title.  Wants Trumpcare which is ironic bcoz he doesn't care.
1001 2018-12-16 05:59:59 You seem very smart. What other stocks you don't like?
1002 2018-12-16 05:59:24 Get the fuck out of stocks. For the love of god. You have about a three month warning before things really fall.  Want to invest in stocks? Invest in inverses or water.

1010 2018-12-16 05:51:39 For me 16th to 23rd december is very volatile and negatively biased. Too many events. Best to stay away for a while or sell some highly overbought stocks positionally..
1011 2018-12-16 05:50:50 401k for more than a decade and hold stocks outside of that. I own real estate as well. And I’m still a pup. This little crypto bear market...meh...I’m in no hurry...

1016 2018-12-16 05:43:48 The owner has so much money he doesn't care, the workers are paying the price. The left seem to be prepared to destroy businesses and jobs just to virtue signal. They only care about themselves. I wonder how many stocks have been cashed out leaving investors to wear the liability
1017 2018-12-16 05:43:35 apple stocks rise by 10%.
1018 2018-12-16 05:42:06 I’m lowkey excited to get back into trading stocks
1019 2018-12-16 05:39:45 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1020 2018-12-16 05:39:19 STOCKS TO WATCH:

1. San Holdings (Jpn)
2. Service Corp International (US)
3. Fu Shou Yuan Int. Group (HK)

Bereavement stocks with good fundamentals. According to Benjamin Franklin, 'In life, only death & taxes are certain'. Plus, strong barriers to entry.
1021 2018-12-16 05:37:34 Yeah, then it becomes more like a shooter game in how it's scored, it depends on how many kills people get. It generally isn't the preferred way people play (stocks are the norm which work like lives), but time matches are great for casual players because no one has to sit out
1022 2018-12-16 05:34:05 2 stocks was fine for Wii U only because they changed how damage works for one on ones now. Matches are going quicker because damage builds faster. 2 stocks = 2 second match.
1023 2018-12-16 05:33:38 But the weekly time frame shows reversal in certain stocks contrary to monthly. And that makes me indecisive 
1024 2018-12-16 05:32:58 Just 6 tech stocks – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google – are responsible for ⅔rds of global stock market returns so far this year.

What? 
1025 2018-12-16 05:31:11 who makes the most money when stocks fall? who bets against the stock market?one man is notorious for it
1026 2018-12-16 05:30:37 An angle I would have loved to see is valuation of stocks. ie what are valuations looking like ? Are most stocks trading below their ‘fair value’? That to me will suggest a good entry time...
1027 2018-12-16 05:25:33 I'll make sure the stocks are up tomorrow for the Christmas Cast!
1028 2018-12-16 05:24:42 I think the parry meta will revolve more about taking stocks. Smash 4 got progressively campier as the game progressed so it is hard to say that it won't be the same.
1029 2018-12-16 05:24:24 Didn't the Obama DOJ say that bump stocks were a nothing burger?  This "ban" talk is just an appeasement.
1030 2018-12-16 05:23:34 No problem! Gotta keep those stocks up~

1039 2018-12-16 05:14:04 Bump stocks/magazine size?  Your ignorance of guns is showing. 1 shooting involved a bump stock, very few used high capacity magazines. So  anything about guns you know nothing about and scares you needs banned? Understanding what you talk about keeps u from looking stupid

1044 2018-12-16 05:08:31 Stockroom was above the store. Stocks were lowered theough a mini elevator. For bisdaks, Mightykod!
1045 2018-12-16 05:04:37 except they get advance notice of everything in committees etc and are allowed to trade and or dump stocks based on that... so its insulation from a plunge ... fuckers
1046 2018-12-16 05:03:30 The Wife and I drive one last spring. We did the math, bought at Audi Q5, and put the rest on CBD stocks. Winning.
1047 2018-12-16 05:03:15 If you check out his site, he's basically asking for donations so he can "buy coal stocks" to encourage more coal burning. This guy is literally crazy and/or a scammer pocketing the money.

I vote we gather funds to launch him to Venus to see how harmful CO2 really is.
1048 2018-12-16 05:02:54 Only 5% make big money in stock markets. Retail is not there in that 5%. 

For retail 12-15% is best & via SIPs in ETFs. 

Individual stocks going through a bear phase are NOT for retail. Not now not when index crashes 20-25%.
1049 2018-12-16 05:02:18 I don’t know if it works better. The network is more secure if the price is higher (more hashpower in PoW, larger cost to attack in PoS). If the network would ever be used on a large scale it could lead to users having ‘consumption stocks’ of ETH.
1050 2018-12-16 05:00:22 I like the idea of options but I need to FOCUS on stocks right now. The book One Thing reminds me to stay focused! I'm over PDT! :D

1052 2018-12-16 04:55:00 Insider trading is a free speech issue. A 1st Amendment issue. 

And we passed laws against it.

Why can’t you tell me what your company is doing so I can make money on stocks from it. It defies Libertarianism to it’s core.
1053 2018-12-16 04:53:05 Do you think that banks, stocks, airlines are free market?

Hell your manicurist is regulated. 

Do you think insider trading laws have always existed. They haven’t. Those had to be written, fought for, and passed.
1054 2018-12-16 04:52:58 Retiring means close 401k or get out of stocks?

1059 2018-12-16 04:50:27 STOCKS TO WATCH:

1. PRESBHD
2. MYEG
3. SCICOM

They were negatively affected after the government decided to scrap many IT projects. But some brokers think the selldown was overdone & could be entry for long term investors.

1067 2018-12-16 04:41:48 $AMD is a solid mover for sure. Nice spot there. If you're working with sub- PDT size account and you haven't already, then I would consider taking a look at trading options. It allows you trade as much as you like and doesn't require a large account value to profit on big stocks

1071 2018-12-16 04:33:23 I'm opening up a Smash arena for Smash Ultimate (Battlefield or Final Destination format, 3 stocks, 7 minutes) open for anyone that's on my friend list (no code needed).
1072 2018-12-16 04:33:01 I’ve been trading $ANF $AMD a lot! And whatever else is in play for the day, then I stick with that one for the entire day. Something seems to be finally working for me! I stick with one & it’s easier to follow that “story.” Jumping stocks is like flipping channels during a show.
1073 2018-12-16 04:32:24 @KenCarman listening to your weekly show has me paying more attention to @Browns   They remind me of @SacramentoKings & how both teams have been laughing stocks for years & now both are on the same track
1074 2018-12-16 04:31:44 At least the put bids in the market when it’s going down. They also provide liquidity. They keep stocks from being too overpriced
1075 2018-12-16 04:30:36 Japanese and EM stocks are safety trades? I don't think so. Investor sentiment is lowest in 5 years. We've had two 10% corrections in 12 months and P/Es have dropped. Credit is still readily available and 10yr bond dropped 35bps. This is not 2008!
1076 2018-12-16 04:27:12 Yep. I gave a list of some great looking stocks. Will always be some winners. Headed to bed. Next two days on a “writing trip” put dedicated time into my book.
1077 2018-12-16 04:25:30 The soundtrack of Die Hard is basically Ode to Joy, so anyone who argues that it isn’t a Christmas movie deserves to be put in the stocks.
1078 2018-12-16 04:24:52 It's obv scam p&d. Billion dollar companies dont rm into bloated unreporting pink sheet stocks with debt. It would be cheaper and easier to direct list to Nasdaq
1079 2018-12-16 04:23:59 Inhofe pushed for and knew what was in the 2018 bloated obscene DoD budget. So purchasing Raytheon after the news only means his trader was lined up to grab these stocks.

They refused.

1084 2018-12-16 04:21:08 Uranium stocks have become a geopolitical play to some extent, the Chinese would probably buy from the Ruski, Soviets, Uzbek and Kazakhstan before us producers just spreading my uranium source
1085 2018-12-16 04:21:03 I am with you on indexes, but not on certain stocks. Look at $TTD, its prices is higher, despite SPY's being lower. , that is relative to each move lower on indexes, it keeps having a higher price. Same on some health care stocks I am involved with.
1086 2018-12-16 04:20:26 Stocks teams don't do that in big games

1089 2018-12-16 04:19:33 The fire under this presidential pot is already hot enough, does CNN need to continuously add more woods ? Our stocks market is on a free fall, everyone has something to loose. All these attacks and counterattacks only makes it worst.
1090 2018-12-16 04:17:14 Morning scoop: .75 to 1.20 is the best profit margin excluding brokerage @ stocks ranging 400< .
1091 2018-12-16 04:14:47 yes. I think 3 stocks, 6(?) minutes, 1v1s

I didn't get a single 1v1 through over a half an hour of playing online and I just had to give up
1092 2018-12-16 04:14:45 Two key examples - 2008, when a number of real estate firms that had borrowed in FX became penny stocks and the equity market itself declined by nearly 50%, neither of which created particularly bad macro outcomes. And 1996 when in the face of rising inflation Rangarajan hiked...
1093 2018-12-16 04:14:11 Yeah :( but im doing GA just because i need to clear my stocks or bcs I have extra money from group order so 
1094 2018-12-16 04:13:39 So sorry for your tremendous loss of a selfless little soul. May the insanity of the NRA’s  resistance against reasonable gun gun control come to an end.  We need to abolish private ownership of all automatic and semi-automatic weapons including bump-stocks which remain legal.

1103 2018-12-16 04:02:58 I found a seller here in my country. They said the lightsticks are in stocks but I'm still doubting if it's true because someone told me it's out of stocks
1104 2018-12-16 04:02:55 Hasn't done it.  Bump stocks are gimmicky junk but should not be banned.  Not going to happen.  Besides, Spec Ops people ID'd the Vegas shooter's weapon as a M249 SAW.  Slower than a bump stock, regular full auto cadence, not the faster and irregular rate of a bump stock.
1105 2018-12-16 04:01:52 That’s what Japan has been doing for awhile now, right?  Their CB is one of the largest shareholder of public stocks.
1106 2018-12-16 04:01:27 He tried with his tax breaks. The bought back stocks and reduced employees and closed businesses. Some help.

Hypothetical (con't): One last thing, Congratulations to $AMD for joining:'NASDAQ-100 Index.' 

Based on Friday's market action, the market seems to favor 'certain' stocks. Everyone might want to review 12/14/2018

Leadership might change in 2019...Permanently.
1127 2018-12-16 03:35:53 The problem is that all the savings that they make is invested very badly in shoddy real estate , land ,FD , loaned to close relatives for business etc etc & it then vanishes....So they are back to square 1...Money earned but not retained...stocks are like gambling to them..
1128 2018-12-16 03:35:48 I am not tied to projects. But can give you few examples.

Google/Facebook were launched after the .com bubble was burst. Many of the .com era stocks like #yahoo #aol never recovered !
1129 2018-12-16 03:35:35 Other beliefs include Khums, the investment of 20% of income in $TSLA or SpaceX stocks/bonds, Tawalla - the expression of love toward Tesla board members, and Jihad against emergency vehicles.
1130 2018-12-16 03:35:03 How is that calculated? I.e I bought btc at 17,000 and it's worth 3,000 roughly, does that mean less tax due to loss or is there a certain market value that determines how much you pay on a fluctuating market. I'm new to stocks as well so I'm uncertain.
1131 2018-12-16 03:33:12 do you ever think about how every barnes and noble stocks multiple copies of mein kampf, in hardcover and paperback

1133 2018-12-16 03:31:03 How are your stocks doing, they’re tanking. Liking tRump is like liking the devil, no amount of money would be worth wanting that psychopath for president.  Hope he gets locked up soon, before he completely destroys USA.
1134 2018-12-16 03:30:52 Can't believe Kevin Lee lost to Al man. All he had to do was grapple, he was by far the better grappler. He got out struck and kept tryna fight stand up with a guy who had his number. Broke mentally and his stocks dropped. Needs to change something mentally to become champ ffs 
1135 2018-12-16 03:30:25 I personally wouldn’t want him but his stocks would still be high
1136 2018-12-16 03:29:40 It’s counter intuitive. Just as early 2009 was the worst of times, Oct 2018 was the best of times with the employment you speak of. A technical double top from early Feb. Stocks will go up again, but maybe not until a lot more pain. But, I hope you’re right.

1148 2018-12-16 03:10:02 3 days is not enough. Get a monthly sub and give it AT LEAST 1 month. 

If you haven't traded 'real' stocks before, it can be a shock to your system. It was for me and many others. One day or week is not nearly fair to you or AJ.

Good luck and reach out to AJ when needed!
1149 2018-12-16 03:09:41 @StocksGFX I think stocks should be the recruit
1150 2018-12-16 03:07:06 What? The UK needs to take back full control of its waters. We must ban Dutch stun trawlers that simply kill everything beneath the boat. We can then manage fish stocks properly &, like Norway, only allow others to fish under licence when there are surplus stocks.

1157 2018-12-16 02:56:53 I was into stocks long before crypto
1158 2018-12-16 02:56:19 While keeping in mind that indices/stocks are in a downtrend, they don’t go straight down or up all the time. This may be an opportunity for long play for a very short period before next leg down if any.
1159 2018-12-16 02:55:09 Yes, I see Double Top on stocks holding Nifty.
1160 2018-12-16 02:54:56 Add the mishap of going into diverse area's that weren't served by the business model of power, and the slop job of monkeying with stocks (Warren Buffet) which wasn't their forte' and they lost their arse. They lost their focus all along.

1166 2018-12-16 02:50:38 Why can’t they just invest in stocks or some shit
1167 2018-12-16 02:50:34 I wonder how many people bought .com stocks during the boom, sold during the bust, said never again and then their super funds automatically bought Cisco/amazon/Apple/MS etc years later once they had regained far higher than their price during the boom and didn’t even know?
1168 2018-12-16 02:50:34 More seriously, stocks and 401ks don’t have guaranteed returns backed by the government - doesn’t mean they’re bad though. The existing banks are so shitty we should welcome anyone trying to do things differently as long as it’s not an outright scam
1169 2018-12-16 02:43:11 Especially since more people don't own stocks than those who do.

1184 2018-12-16 02:28:53 Nothing wrong with this graph. But i feel in such projections whether in crypto market or stocks, we should project percentage growth between two adj maximas vs between adj min and max. That would be a much fair story to tell.

1186 2018-12-16 02:25:36 absolutely.. I think there is a huge risk for a spike here with china talks still in motion. Whenever that bounce happens, its just another chance to buy discount PUTS on overpriced stocks.
1187 2018-12-16 02:23:41 Yeah . Too much like hard work unfortunately.  But agree any govt worth its salt should. Downturn coming.. public housing stocks in major capitals abysmal.
1188 2018-12-16 02:23:00 I like it. I’m coming to the conclusion that this may be how to get an edge after months of trading a lot of different stocks but a couple of the same ones.

1191 2018-12-16 02:16:09 Not only nifty, all the nifty stocks and other fno stocks are nt showing weakness in any time frame. Also, interesting thing is most of the stocks have high rate of delivery & volumes are at life time peak. I read as accumulation by biggies. I may be completely wrong.
1192 2018-12-16 02:15:32 I’m lazy. Only stocks I own are AMZN, GOOG and BRK. Most of my stock holdings are index ETFs.
1193 2018-12-16 02:08:33 It's probably because any smart investor knows there's a credit bubble around the corner along with stocks losing value. History always repeats itself so they'd also know Crypto can moon anytime now

1206 2018-12-16 01:55:43 Got in with some meaningful cash by around 17.5K, got splashed with ice at 12.5K; and decided to learn to TA trade. Got comfortable at 8.8K levels, and then realised it is much easier to trading skillsets in stocks & commodities due to lesser volatility.

1211 2018-12-16 01:52:45 I think that’s still the point, this is a short term correction based on what, China trade concerns? Oh wait, we’re going into recession next year with record low unemployment. Big name stocks down 20-30% with little to no change to earnings. I’ll buy more 
1212 2018-12-16 01:51:10 Since Congress stripped the protections against that and more out of the bill Yeah guess they were looking out for the big money makers. shoulda invested in insurance co stocks to get your money back ;) Trickledown theory is really Evaporate up .
1213 2018-12-16 01:50:39 This is exactly whats haunting me , WHY we haven't seen panic yet despite all the gloom and doom. In conclusion I'm of the opinion that this dip is being bought and stocks will rise into 2019 on a strong econony.

1264 2018-12-16 00:54:35 The time to buy emerging-market assets amd stocks would be when the Fed starts to cut rates, and that could be 18 months away.
1265 2018-12-16 00:53:50 Youre exactly right tho. So dont mind them.
The stock market is only for wealthy people.
The few working people who have stocks, are the ones who get hurt the most if it fails because they dont have a lot of stock or power stocks.
1266 2018-12-16 00:52:11 We can only hope! I have a lot of oil stocks in my long term investments. Those stocks are going to make me a ton more money!

1268 2018-12-16 00:47:44 Of course you can. Where's this coming from? 
It would be better if people with stocks cared about working and poor.
1269 2018-12-16 00:46:36 yeah, worse frame too, he is like 4 months younger than frosh Lonzo, he has similar metrics, 9.9% usage only, 12BPM lol, 5.3 stocks per 100 as a thin Guard
1270 2018-12-16 00:46:22 So @liltsun isn't allowed to pick smash modes anymore

99 stock sudden death is funny for the first twenty stocks but oof
1271 2018-12-16 00:46:05 Can someone finally do an ICO for a platform about basic financial intelligence, economics, crypto markets, stocks, trading, investing, entrepreneurship, market cycles, mining etc. @APompliano @CryptoShillNye @iamjosephyoung @tradingroomapp @PeterMcCormack @PhilakoneCrypto
1272 2018-12-16 00:46:01 ...or stocks could fall 10% or they could rise 20% or they could fall 20%.  Nobody knows.  Given how 2018 is ending I wouldn't be surprised to see multiple 10-15% moves in both directions.
1273 2018-12-16 00:45:21 Twitter is a wonderful resource to learn. It won’t teach you what to do. It’s the best teacher of what NOT to do. Wait till Monday, the barrage of self promotion on beaten down stocks ready to further cliff dive. They’ll use any news any biased information to get stocks moving 
1274 2018-12-16 00:45:13 Many great stocks with single digit PE ratios. Not bad risk reward buying unless earnings take a greater than 50% hit. That  would be extreme IMO. $kors $fdx $et
1275 2018-12-16 00:44:23 Wala namang sinabi sa CA decision na dealer of stocks ang Rappler
1276 2018-12-16 00:43:55 Is investors getting there stocks up saying soon we’ll be the cleanest group.
1277 2018-12-16 00:43:34 If You Want To Invest In Stocks & You’re Unsure In What You Want To Invest Look Up Comapnies That Produce The Products You Use Daily
1278 2018-12-16 00:42:49 The Emergency Banking Act was successful! Stocks are up by 15 percent! This is the first step of ‘Relief,Recovery,and Reform!’
1279 2018-12-16 00:42:16 Now, if you tell me you have $100k or even $50k and you are gonna take it to $1M then that’s really achievable because you have the capital to invest in all sorts of stocks and price ranges.
1280 2018-12-16 00:40:39 And you're using US MAGAt slogans. How's that working out for them? A president who cheated and lied his way into the position still cheating and lying with not a clue how to run a country. Ask the soy bean farmers, the GM workers, and anyone who owns or trade stocks-Fail!
1281 2018-12-16 00:39:44 how many ppl you know still got mad gainz from stocks looking to throw stacks at crypto rn?

everyone that did that last yr during bull run are now brokeAF™ looking for jobs, and dont want to touch the shit.
1282 2018-12-16 00:39:26 Bump stocks allow you the ability to essentially turn your semi auto into full auto. Now I know your NRA nut jobs out there will say I’m wrong but The simple fact is you can get off I helluva lot more rounds use in one then without. And even Trump Couldn’t justify their existence
1283 2018-12-16 00:38:46 @Kohls how are you gonna sell XL sweaters that are literally the size of a medium sweater? This is outrageous you need better stocks in your stores
1284 2018-12-16 00:37:16 Why wouldn’t it make sense? He had an entire parking lot filled with targets, and equipped with his bump stocks he was able to mow down hundreds within 10 minutes. And that is where this country is going my friend
1285 2018-12-16 00:36:12 Unlike a federal judge to scream for attention like this. Unfathomable that a non-partial judge would make such a drastic ruling - Plus the timing. Screams dirty distraction. Trump / NRA / Russia ties?  Def more going on here -  Kickbacks? Stocks? Pay for play... #FollowTheMoney
1286 2018-12-16 00:36:03 S&P 500 FUTURES HAS CORRELATION RATIO ABOVE 0.3 WITH  MOST WORLD STOCKS, WHICH WILL FALL DOWN NEXT MONDAY.

1288 2018-12-16 00:34:45 Well here’s the problem with your theory,  Trump was in office not Obama when this happened and believe it or not Trump made the move to ban bump stocks which should also never be on the market
1289 2018-12-16 00:34:34 3 Stocks seems incorrect imo.  All my matches go to time at 7 minutes online lol.
1290 2018-12-16 00:33:12 Bear markets in stocks and real estate will substantially reduce the grand canyon like wealth inequality that is slowly destroying the west.

1292 2018-12-16 00:31:03 Trump was live on television owning the Shutdown days ago. Chuck and Nancy walked mere steps to the press to reiterate #TrumpShutdown


The only people more stupid than Trump is his supporters - like yourself.

1294 2018-12-16 00:27:30 Oh and I don't even play a character who's good at killing on that stage in PM. This is just when I take stocks with squirtle, a character who frankly sucks at killing.

Don't make this mistake twice.
1295 2018-12-16 00:25:59 Welp. I'm moving my stocks.

Easy!!

Thanks Pacific Life!

1297 2018-12-16 00:22:00 I learned how to invest in stocks, my Roth IRA, trading options and crypto all by myself. That would have been difficult then. Now we have so many apps for saving like Stash, Acorns, even for crypto like @crumbsappio.

1299 2018-12-16 00:19:36 That surplus was the product of a bubble in tech stocks, the dollar and real estate, a product of deregulation. A budget surplus isn't a good thing, it always precipitates a recession for obvious reasons.

1302 2018-12-16 00:14:48 Stocks, Options
1303 2018-12-16 00:13:51 The stock market is actually extremely fair compared to most other ways to invest. Regular people can buy exactly same stocks as anyone else, but they don't have access to private equity, all kinds of bonds, VC, hedge funds,etc. (probably better for them, but that's still unfair)
1304 2018-12-16 00:13:16 Do you know a good etf (besides IGV) that has the enterprise software stocks like $OKTA, $SPLK, $TWLO, $TTD, $NOW, $WDAY, $TEAM, $ZS
1305 2018-12-16 00:13:08 haha sige, di ko kase dala binder ko kaya nawala sa isip ko kung may stocks pa ba ko o wala na  eh dumaan kami kagabi ni pril dun sa court side kaya ayun napabili kami  baka paabot ko nalang kay pril if ever hehe

1308 2018-12-16 00:10:15 Totally agreed. it'll take time for stocks to build bases so we can get long swings opportunities with good RRR, and  I'm not in a hurry to pick a bottom.
1309 2018-12-16 00:09:56 NYT had a front-page story this morning about how the prices of both stocks and bonds are down for the year. Little surprise: it had to happen at some point because capital couldn’t stay this cheap forever. One other thing that should be likely to happen… (1/2)

1313 2018-12-16 00:07:16 @WeissRatings why is it that your website does not mention any cryptocurrencies and yet you never tweet about the insurance companies, banks, stocks, etc. that are on your website? I’m expecting a reply rather than a block if you are who you say you are. #xrpcommmunity #XRP

1358 2018-12-15 23:26:20 The key is to not panic sell... Oh and to use index funds. Investing in multiple stocks reduces risk in much the same way as investing over multiple years reduces risk.

1362 2018-12-15 23:25:01 Yeah, it does look different - and again, that indicates how important it is to understand what's inside the box. Dividend-paying stocks currently have high valuations, so the shareholder yield funds that the ETF holds look at buybacks and debt paydown as well.
1363 2018-12-15 23:23:47 Very unusual for Bonds, Stocks, and hedgefunds to be down all at the same time. Also the only market which is up this year is Brazil, but when you factor in that the Brazilian Real has fallen 16% this year, it’s not really a place where you would have wanted to put your money.
1364 2018-12-15 23:23:00 Buy AMD stocks

1366 2018-12-15 23:16:40 Yes. Then we'll short Christmas decoration stocks . People are going nuts for them at the moment but really feel like the market could take a dive in a few weeks. Can't people no-one else sees it!
1367 2018-12-15 23:14:54 Stocks weren't exactly popular for a few years after the GFC. Thinking otherwise seems like revisionism to me.
1368 2018-12-15 23:14:50 Great advices. If i could go back in time, i wouldnt have bought a house in my 20s.  Would have been much better off today. Bc all the money that went into down payment, taxes, hoa dues, note.... could have went straight into buying stocks during financial crash & rental props.
1369 2018-12-15 23:13:44 Do you know for something so ancient stocks are remarkably modern?!
1370 2018-12-15 23:13:32 What other stocks are you buying Giovanni?
1371 2018-12-15 23:13:07 Yeah, I'm sure Ackman wishes he never bothered shorting stocks.
1372 2018-12-15 23:11:15 I have no problem with shorting stocks. That being said, I've never known anyone who is able to make a steady living selling stocks short. The service fees, vig, commission, bid/ask, and upward drift of the stock market cause great headwinds and make it tough to work.
1373 2018-12-15 23:09:57 Doctored stats in China and Saudi buying of stocks to boost the market. It's all optics management.. and it ends poorly.
1374 2018-12-15 23:09:15 Stocks to keep watch:

$NDRA $STAF $EYES $RKDA $HSGX $NVLN $AMD $NVDA $ALQA $NBEV $GLBS $DRYS $ABIL $AXSM
1375 2018-12-15 23:09:03 I liked the idea of holding gold as an investment and bought some but sold it as it doesn’t give a return. Stocks go up/down in cycles and will buy more if they crash. Crypto moves so fast and the gains are so high I’m staying invested even until zero as it’s worth the risk.....
1376 2018-12-15 23:07:53 Can't you see it, the Republican's are willfully trying to destroy America! Just like they inflate stocks before bailing! Just like they syphon off as much money as they can stealing retirement accounts from their workers pension plans so stocks plummet before mergers, get it
1377 2018-12-15 23:07:40 So happy na may mga stocks na 
1378 2018-12-15 23:07:35 Bit of a delicacy.

1388 2018-12-15 22:56:11 Gold has traded in a small range for years since the top in 11/12. Making zero gains for people holding and waiting for the price to rise. Stocks have paid dividends and btc has gone from a couple of $ to thousands. Gold is too slow and with small upside compared to other assets.
1389 2018-12-15 22:55:18 Trying to push myself to invest in stocks but dont know where to start
1390 2018-12-15 22:54:49 #WR: How 2019 will start in Wall Street? Part 1. Today @Barronsonline wrote about the stocks movement in last few days: “like an old car, stocks shuddered shook, settled down - and stalled.” Before was the China trade war. Now, the excuse is the fall of oil prices... #WallStreet
1391 2018-12-15 22:54:00 I never, ever, ever, realized that stocks trade on higher time frames the same way they do on 1 min charts. Why haven't I been watching for safe entries on higher time frames? No gurus are teaching correctly. #dumpyourguru
1392 2018-12-15 22:53:56 Hey guys, does anybody here invest in marijuana stocks? I plan to give them a try, wondering which ones are best...
1393 2018-12-15 22:53:54 TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR is down 7% YTD.  Last week the sector was slightly lower.  I avoid theses stocks because of the very competitive nature of the sector.
1394 2018-12-15 22:53:48 That's mostly just a few janky characters/moves. There's a reason Smash 4 games only use two stocks.
1395 2018-12-15 22:51:51 Tip - Day trading stocks is probably the most well known day trading market, it is also the most capital-intensive. In USA you must have at least $25,000 in your day trading account, otherwise you can’t trade.
1396 2018-12-15 22:51:32 My thought is we haven’t had a “Stocks are dead” since the 1970s. Are we due? I don’t know. But the idea that you can invest in anything, buy any dip and you will always do well is a concerning narrative. 

This has been true my entire life.
1397 2018-12-15 22:50:55 Ten years from now maybe stocks *are* crypto.
1398 2018-12-15 22:50:27 Sure. Agreed. We don’t know the future. 

Reading an article from Grants in 99. He points out that 25 year cycles are common. In the 50s belief was stocks are worthless. In 99 that it was impossible to lose. 

We are more of a 99 than 50s..
1399 2018-12-15 22:47:49 **on first date**

Me: So you trade stocks that's so cool so do I!

Bagholder chick: Yeah I just bought a bunch of $MDXG in my 401k!

Me: Check please!
1400 2018-12-15 22:47:39 Darn. Martha Stewart who made 42K dumping stocks based on a tip had to serve 5 months in prison followed by house arrest and probation. Who knew could’ve lied that she was caught off guard.

Michael Flynn conspired with Russians against America and will walk free.
1401 2018-12-15 22:47:01 Juve was no where 1 billion worth club.
Ronaldo joined, stocks started to reach sky, Juve became billion worth club and their revenue is still going. They're currently top 30 brand in football but according to some Juve fans, Ronaldo FC is annoying
1402 2018-12-15 22:44:11 Watching it all unfold with @Battlefield V's terrible direction and implementation of atrocious ideas makes me glad I didn't buy into the hype. Even the stocks dipping more and more, just like it's player base.
1403 2018-12-15 22:44:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo

1406 2018-12-15 22:43:25 Stocks are up
1407 2018-12-15 22:43:19 Liz Ann already gave her forecast. We are having a recession. Go to cash. Don’t buy stocks. Not really helpful to your company’s business but thanks for honesty & pessimism.
1408 2018-12-15 22:42:53 He's not buying stocks either,,, so I get what that means?
1409 2018-12-15 22:41:43 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
1410 2018-12-15 22:39:58 How to make money in stocks is my favorite.
1411 2018-12-15 22:39:56 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1412 2018-12-15 22:38:34 CHOCOLATE DREAM CAKE for ! 

available today  pm me for orders .. limited stocks only
1413 2018-12-15 22:37:31 If you’re buying solid companies with good financials not really. That’s a way to buy great stocks at a discount, ask buffet who made a fortune in the 2008 crisis when solid company stocks were mad cheap. That’s exploiting market psychology at its best.
1414 2018-12-15 22:36:49 Greg, your January spreads are bullish for those stocks right? If we’re reaching max. saturation, aren’t you concerned with them being exercised?
1415 2018-12-15 22:36:24 Bump stocks = pant belt loop lol
1416 2018-12-15 22:35:31 US stocks today after the decision losing. Is that what you want? For America. You do not serve America with such deeds.
1417 2018-12-15 22:34:14 Stocks shouldn’t exist in the first place
1418 2018-12-15 22:30:10 PLEASE be aware that @Activision is KILLING @Blizzard_Ent games. @BlizzHeroes have been cancelled just to make MORE MONEY. They don't care about the community. BOYCOTT ALL @ATVI_AB  GAMES. Without us they die too. STOCKS market 80$ to only 47% today.. continue like this guys!
1419 2018-12-15 22:28:44 2018 YIR:A Gamers Perspective! More than a few companies this year held a competition to see who could perform the best sinking of a franchise(s), while setting fire to stocks and causing customers to flee in a rage/panic! Enjoy your fruits @EA @bethesda @Activision
1420 2018-12-15 22:27:53 That’s an insane amount of risk to try to do that when you can do the same play with 99% of stocks without fighting awful fundamentals
1421 2018-12-15 22:26:38 I hate how people online use fast characters/characters with low endlag (sonic, greninja) and teabag when they take stocks because they’re hard to punish while it’s laggy

But that’s just a reason to keep practicing & learning
1422 2018-12-15 22:23:15 The lessons cover stocks, bonds, buying a house, fire and life insurance, taxes, and borrowing money, checks and drafts. Plus some basic equations.
1423 2018-12-15 22:22:11 Good bitcoin and stocks?!
1424 2018-12-15 22:21:11 The value went up in the stocks
1425 2018-12-15 22:19:57 Well even gundlach said he was not bullish on stocks or bonds. Why buy it ?
1426 2018-12-15 22:19:17 People on Quickplay are wildin. 2 stocks? 4 minutes? They have to be on drugs.
1427 2018-12-15 22:17:15 You should talk about “failed” with your track record!!! TWO stocks that fell off the board; FOUR bouts of bankruptcy; THIRTEEN companies that collapsed Like Trump University ( cost ya 25 large), Trump Airline, Trump Steaks!!!
1428 2018-12-15 22:16:02 It should never be up to hope if you’re in a trade, I don’t understand why that’s the only reason someone could be long stocks right now.
1429 2018-12-15 22:15:53 When the stock market dumps some more it could be interesting to look at some buying opportunities in regards to other future trends than crypto - mainly I watch for ETFs in the robotics/AI/autonomation area!
There is no way around industrie 4.0

1430 2018-12-15 22:15:53 T’a peut etre manger tout leur stocks 
1431 2018-12-15 22:15:12 If religions had publicly traded stocks, I’d buy them during financial crises.
1432 2018-12-15 22:14:35 GOP own huge percentage of healthcare REIT's, Insurance stocks. Simple.
1433 2018-12-15 22:13:40 @Tip Stocks in jail? Your Brilliant! 
#ASAP
1434 2018-12-15 22:13:23 Yeah massively mate, 7 figures and his stocks rose massively. Could set up a big domestic fight with DeGale after. Don’t think he could turn that fight off he could turn that fight down, big bollocks
1435 2018-12-15 22:12:41 I assume they would have continued to make them after the War if needed to. But I imagine there could well have  been adequate stocks left over after the War.
1436 2018-12-15 22:12:29 How is it NOT insider trading Nance? when you short specific stocks in 07 before the meltdown????
1437 2018-12-15 22:11:12 Buy some stocks in weed and get rich
1438 2018-12-15 22:10:56 working on my laptop in a British pub
guy sitting at my table: what you typing away on your laptop
me: just working
guy: I thought you're doing stocks and shares
me: no I'm not Brad Pitt in the big short
1439 2018-12-15 22:10:44 3 out of my 4 games today were 3 stocks so that was cool
1440 2018-12-15 22:08:08 Most Lithium stocks all now at key July 2017 support Zones before all the hype. My Xmas money may start flowing back in here, My picks $AGY $AJM $BGS ( $AVZ as a possible darkie with a Chinese Takeover 2019). Market needs to settle also
1441 2018-12-15 22:07:53 So this sounds like they are saying open water farms are bad for wild salmon stocks. Good figure.
1442 2018-12-15 22:06:40 Culprit artificial interest rates,money creation,laundering,inside trading stocks,bonds,all mrkts.,extreme economics,fluctuations,bubbles,stocks,commodity, real estate.
Nothing works as past proven,disciplined metrics,no good paying jobs.
where would kids turn,of course parents?
1443 2018-12-15 22:06:04 This is really a misleading article. Most retirees have most of their savings in stocks or stock equivalents. If divided-paying stocks are mostly owned, an acceptable monthly cash flow does not require withdrawal of 4% of savings. Much less, if any, need be withdrawn.
1444 2018-12-15 22:05:36 Energy Stocks continue to get hammered this week as Oil and Natural Gas prices dropped.   The talk  is world economies are slowing reducing demand for oil.  And USA is drilling record amounts of oil & gas.  OPEC /Russia plans to cut production didn't do much to help prices
1445 2018-12-15 22:05:22 I think more like a short seller than focusing on the S&P 500. My targets are stocks that go down 75-100%... and there are plenty, far more than in 2006-07. Suffice it to say, this bear mkt will be ugly, and cut deeper than 2008-09.
1446 2018-12-15 22:05:00 Yes it's the weekend of 22nd & 23rd Dec. Free Books for children while stocks last. I am hoping a few more publishers and authors will help out by donating a few books. 
Thank you for sponsoring two books for #GiveAChildABook
1447 2018-12-15 22:04:26 We issued a $1 million challenge to any professional money manager who thought stocks would outperform crypto over the next decade.

Don’t listen to the naysayers. They don’t even believe what they say.

Always follow the money 
1448 2018-12-15 22:03:40 KOP Gotta Be The Worst Mall In America Now.. Damn, Stocks Fell Drastically
1449 2018-12-15 22:03:24 Stocks tanking should be the least of it. They should be prosecuted.
1450 2018-12-15 22:02:47 Fisicamente não aconteceu nada, mas vimos que ele tem que ser o jogador que sai do banco. Stocks chegou melhor.
1451 2018-12-15 22:02:08 Metal Silver News→  The Long Winter Of Abuse Is Over: Things Look Very Bullish For #Gold Mining Stocks: The conditions in this beleaguered…
1452 2018-12-15 22:01:05 If SCOTUS agrees with the Texas judge the GOP may be in even more trouble with voters of all persuasions. Conversely, if the decision is overturned, Dems lose, participants continue paying more, and healthcare stocks continue thriving thanks to ACA. Regardless, change ACA now.
1453 2018-12-15 22:00:59 why is smash ultimate matchmaking so bad? Like I set my preferred rules and yeah let’s get into a game with unlimited stocks. Shits fkn dumb 
1454 2018-12-15 22:00:53 super light, dies at 30 to smash attacks, struggles sealing stocks, is overly reliant on back air and up air setups when most characters can just kill you by simply pressing a tilt attack.
does not have enough hit stun to make anything safe and constantly trades hits.
1455 2018-12-15 22:00:09 Find #stocks where if you are wrong you don't lose much and if you are right you win big, very big.
1456 2018-12-15 21:56:42 There are several. $AMD? $TSLA did a 10x from 2012-2014, and now it's way higher. I'm sure I could find others.

Hard to compare crypto to stocks though. I do think if ETH delivers on its promises then this will look like a cheap price in the future.
1457 2018-12-15 21:55:18 I think, specifically, bank leverage. The Japanese banks were very highly leveraged (prompting Basel 1). The US banks were highly leveraged during GFC. Doesn’t explain all bubbles though (2000 tech stocks)
1458 2018-12-15 21:54:40 The USA Stock Market Decline (down 2% YTD, 10% off Highs) has a long ways to go to equal the market declines in Europe (down 16% YTD, 21% off highs) and China (21% YTD, 26% off highs).  it's likely YOU Do NOT have to hold stocks in your IRA accounts or 401Ks.
1459 2018-12-15 21:52:56 Surprise to see gaming stocks as tier 2.  They still have plenty of growth but maybe lesser evaluations in 2019.  Where $AMD?
1460 2018-12-15 21:51:32 Maybe so for US stocks, but what about EM?
1461 2018-12-15 21:50:12 The only way out of ut is to claim your original birth certificate that has been placed on the stocks since birth. Held up in the court system can be retrieved at place of birth in the register of deeds, a long awaited process that begins with the dismantling of strawman account
1462 2018-12-15 21:49:22 $SPX without the right confirmation more downside is not favoured  the, weekly chart info is old world thinking,key stocks remain a lot stronger then people think. This market has changed since 2016 and 2010 and 2000 only adaptive thinking and adaptive planning will rule it $SPY
1463 2018-12-15 21:49:08 Unfortunately, CVS is worse, and no other pharmacy stocks them.
1464 2018-12-15 21:49:07 @coinbase We get fees for buying/withdrawing stocks. For keeping our #BSV funds, WE, As investors should charge them late fees+daily interest (price changes everyday - we  could have invested this funds somewhere else!) The question is so simple, yet they make it so complicated
1465 2018-12-15 21:46:59 Stocks lost all their gains from the last year... I don't think anybody is being greedy right now. Again, I don't like to compare stocks to crypto because most of the 100bn market cap of Crypto is BS and have 0 backing nor usability.
1466 2018-12-15 21:46:39 Well first the second ? I trade only stocks at this time but I am interested and looking into futures. As for how I use bookmap I use it for interday entry and exit points  I do not enter a trade without a min 1/4 r/r for my 1st target I don’t believe that r/r is a scalp cont 
1467 2018-12-15 21:46:12 Correct, however, more Stocks on the stock market than crypto's. 98% of people never look or care about their 401ks or investments that are bundled into a "mutual fund" I think crypto goes that route. There will be, and already are, companies that create these for people.
1468 2018-12-15 21:43:03 Bump stocks are useless garbage. This post is misleading.
1469 2018-12-15 21:41:47 Amen. The tariffs aren't helping anybody either. Stocks are down. Home sales slowing. Scary.
1470 2018-12-15 21:41:06 There is this really weird bug that's happening when I play 2v2. It is a 3 stock match but I die after 2 stocks but my teammate dies after 3? Like it will say i have 2 stock left and then when I get knocked off it says I have none and I lose
1471 2018-12-15 21:40:56 Well, I am mostly cash, bonds and some gold stocks plus some special situations. So..
1472 2018-12-15 21:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1473 2018-12-15 21:39:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1474 2018-12-15 21:39:15 I don't. I have a select few that I watch and chart patterns. I choose my stocks based on option price. If they have cheap premiums I can trade 3-4 contracts in my small account 2-3 weeks out for less than 100. PFE, X, VZ, BAC. Stuff like that with decent volume
1475 2018-12-15 21:38:54 Yeah, getting gold stocks is easily the most challenging part of any assignment. Aerodrome's C cap is probably the best location to grind headshots. Lots of side protection so you really only have to worry about a few angles, lots of cover to shift positions constantly.
1476 2018-12-15 21:38:46 Reason for me not transitioning but adding to My work load is bc I work for the government and my mommy bills need to be paid and my stocks not looking like  bc Trump won’t stop tweeting bs
1477 2018-12-15 21:38:34 As reparations.  They've paid more with their unjust imprisonment than any investor has buying stocks.
1478 2018-12-15 21:37:30 Market may be leaning towards utilities, defense, and pharmaceutical stocks
1479 2018-12-15 21:37:14 Can we talk about wage growth?
Oh, wait!  The corporate tax cut was used to buy back stocks, not improve wages.
1480 2018-12-15 21:36:52 RETAILS stocks have been getting hammered recently irrespective of strong Retail Sales reports reported by government.   Investors believe people will be cutting back in 2019 because of  the uncertainty surrounding government.  Investors are focusing on declining world economies.
1481 2018-12-15 21:36:18 Stocks tank and 401(s) too. Layoffs are picking up and tariffs are strangling manufacturing and farming. You lie like a rug on this account.
1482 2018-12-15 21:35:11 Never fails when Democrats take the House stocks turn to shit. Let me buy this gold
1483 2018-12-15 21:33:11 Not trying to troll here, but it feels like Smash 4 players just aren't used to losing stocks earlier.
1484 2018-12-15 21:32:16 The reason crayfish/snapper stocks may have reduced is because commercial fisherman are allowed to take too much IMO.
1485 2018-12-15 21:28:55 Never in the history of our Country has a "president" been more dishonest than the one today. Stocks that should be good, are bad. 
Blah Blah Blah. Your Gaslighting is really getting old and boring.
1486 2018-12-15 21:27:37 Which stocks? Absolute performance or risk-adjusted performance?
1487 2018-12-15 21:26:41 Another reason why they don't let the public pick individual stocks in a 529 plan.
1488 2018-12-15 21:26:31 You Always can make money even when stocks and cryptocurrencies are declining.  You can "short" the market...ie buy stocks or futures take money when stocks or crypto declines.
1489 2018-12-15 21:26:30 $1500 btc and ether goes to $35 by end of January.  Stocks enter correction territory too! 2019 will begin with a crypto depression and a stock correction

1493 2018-12-15 21:24:16 'Herbert Hoover says that he received the following advice from Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon after the stock market crash of 1929: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system."'
1494 2018-12-15 21:24:01 Aspic is an industry alternative to gelatine; made from clarified meat, fish or vegetable stocks and gelatine.

الاسبوع هذا تتضح الرؤية والله أعلم
1496 2018-12-15 21:23:50 Oh most of there stocks have been on the rise because microtransactions. Lately they have been falling and I think consumers are becoming tired of the micros and pay to win.
1497 2018-12-15 21:19:06 $FDX lost nearly 20% in last two weeks. Also, 15 of 85 S&P 100 stocks we track have lost more than 10% in last two weeks. This is investing pain. $SPX $ES_F
1498 2018-12-15 21:18:53 Guillotine for all who perpetrated espionage and theft from taxpayers and grifting in office.

Seize ALL their assets, then prison for those Congresscritters who lobbied for the stocks they own. Assets go to helping ppl. THAT would rly piss them off.
1499 2018-12-15 21:15:58 So my aunt buys stuff for like 10 cents at like target and stocks up for the year and then gives gifts okay ! So for her Christmas party she gave me a gift bag with some stuff I said I was never gonna use cuz I don’t need it ! Or so I thought
1500 2018-12-15 21:14:54 عاد انا ناوي اتملك حصة في المتحد الكويتي
اشوف محدٍ درى عني... او مو مبين للحين  
1501 2018-12-15 21:14:38 40% is better than good that's for sure. And actually they have to make up for anything that's a total loss like VZ that got downgraded. 40% isn't too bad in my book when buying 2-3 weeks out
I try to find stocks that are divergent from RSI. Lower lows in price and higher on RSI
1502 2018-12-15 21:14:22 There were some absolute face rippers on $LEH right before the end.  Was an insane thing to watch.  All those housing stocks did the same thing.  There were some +20% days for some of those that were scary as hell to be caught in
1503 2018-12-15 21:14:15 Really dissapointed in myself for not being calmer. I won game 1 with 2 stocks left and game 2 would've been the same. 

Anyway im sick as hell, im going to bed.
1504 2018-12-15 21:13:44 You did not stop and you are absolutely trolling anyone who tweets anything about your pbrain vendetta stocks $pkg $east $cybx $grat. You’re not trying to help anyone because the fact is very good money can absolutely be made on all of these stocks Short and long term #getoverit

1510 2018-12-15 21:08:38 At least let's build him some stocks or something. Trafalgar Square perhaps? Whole nation will feel better.
1511 2018-12-15 21:07:21 I am worried. I am a software engineer and folks nowadays brandish 500k/yr packages like they mean nothing. The level of entitlement in FAANG employees runs deep, most have never seen tough times, don't believe in ever selling their stocks (specially FAANG). Day of reckoning soon
1512 2018-12-15 21:07:13 Man, if he go s to prison, I’m going to buy stocks on the KY jell. 
1513 2018-12-15 21:06:29 Art, is it possible to trade Canadian oil directly  (other than  using Canadian oil stocks)?
1514 2018-12-15 21:04:14 Effort does not equal success in this world. Farmers work a lot harder than most upper level corporate jobs, yet they aren't necessarily richer than a person who pushes stocks around.
1515 2018-12-15 21:02:11 Ready for this job to let me buy these stocks
1516 2018-12-15 21:01:05 My honest opinion is that @viceroyresearch has people behind who are making lots of money shorting stocks that it targets. I'd call this financial terrorism
1517 2018-12-15 21:00:32 Buy some crystals  this is good  maybe buy stocks in a crystal company coz there are enough muppets out there who might actually believe a pretty looking rock is gonna make them rich. 
1518 2018-12-15 20:59:56 Is this how Betsy stocks her adoption company?
1519 2018-12-15 20:59:55 Its ok to use stocks if it is a manipulation etc. I do a lot of designs without stocks btw and yes i have a lot of knowledge about designs
1520 2018-12-15 20:59:43 Cash, multifamily real estate, mobile home parks and RV parks, early stage startups. That’s where my money is. Gonna play the long game on stocks as well all tucked into my 401k and SEP IRA.
1521 2018-12-15 20:59:31 I think you can usually find it in Nisa locals if the local offy fails you. I know our one stocks it.
1522 2018-12-15 20:58:33 But I’m surprised preferred rule set works now. Every match I played today was 1v1 without items. Just some 2 stocks…
1523 2018-12-15 20:58:20 A good reason to bring back the medieval stocks. Nasty man.
1524 2018-12-15 20:58:10 You seem smart. What other stocks you don't like?
1525 2018-12-15 20:57:15 every major type of investment is faring poorly, as the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits is  dampened by rising trade tensions and interest rates. Stocks around the world are getting pummeled, while commodities and bonds are tumbling. OWN IT TRUMP, your fault.
1526 2018-12-15 20:55:49 Gundlach also predicted in January that the S&P 500 would show a loss in 2018 and, with stocks near unchanged for the year, he reiterated that prediction. He added that 90% of asset classes have negative year-to-date returns, which is the highest such percentage since 1900.
1527 2018-12-15 20:55:06 We saw a bubble in the #FAANG stocks too; there is a lot of #money looking for a home, and more and more #traders are being short-term traders. But I believe it is for the best that we look to long-term #investing and not short-term trends.
1528 2018-12-15 20:54:53 You know why bump stocks got banned? Because the NRA signed off on it that it was ok to ban them. They are frauds, I quit donating to people who compromise my rights. My local groups do more for gun rights than the nra. Do a google search, your mind will be blown. NRA is a joke.
1529 2018-12-15 20:54:49 Thanks bro  , I eat sleep STOCKS, that's all 
1530 2018-12-15 20:54:43 Well look at how the different press stocks are doing on Wall Street, that’s what will let you know who is saying the true and who is not, very simple, we are hitting to a new era, very soon, the fake news won’t matter...
1531 2018-12-15 20:54:09 @FuturesTrader71 why do you trade futures over stocks ? And for someone who has never traded futures but has done well consistently in trading stocks but is interested in trading futures what one would you suggest to trade and what info to know about it .

1534 2018-12-15 20:52:45 (CAPE) ratio for EM stocks is less than half that of the S&P 500. In the last 20 years, Gundlach said there were times when it was even higher.Also  EM equities could outperform U.S. stocks by 100%.  But, warned,that you need a long-term, 7to 20-year investment  horizon.
1535 2018-12-15 20:52:03 Priority ranking for the type on investments you should have in your RRSP and/or RIF:

1. interest-bearing securities
2. high-quality U.S. or foreign stocks and stock funds
3. high-quality Canadian stocks or stock funds with low yields.
1536 2018-12-15 20:51:16 Cemetery, mortuary and cremation stocks are going up.
1537 2018-12-15 20:51:02 You mean putting you in stocks on the public square?
1538 2018-12-15 20:50:33 To a corporate board room on the top floor the world looks small & insignificant. Dump all Large Cap stocks in your portfolios, even 401K investors have a say. Small & Mid cap companies are far more responsible, but one must be selective. It is the only way to force change.

1540 2018-12-15 20:48:48 The world is laughing at trump and his followers. Yes my 401(k) and stocks grew a little. But they’ve been growing since 2010. I’d prefer an adult President that doesn’t employ his family and isn’t under multiple investigations
1541 2018-12-15 20:48:37 Naa bro, being greedy while others are fearful is where #crypto is right now. Many are being greedy with The stocks  when its time to be fearing.
1542 2018-12-15 20:48:15 That's what I mean I did not see index selling just pressure on certain stocks.
1543 2018-12-15 20:48:03 All that money on the sidelines needs to be put to work soon. Where is it going stocks or RealEstate...? Only a few months from now we will know. A char to keep an eye on for sure!
1544 2018-12-15 20:47:36 I gotta ask a question even if I don't own stocks or have a 401k or a job I still can't be allowed to care about working class people and care about there futures as well?
1545 2018-12-15 20:47:24 Jimmy stocks are your bread and butter that is 10 shares of Berkshire you could have bought and got a divided on instead that’s 10 hangovers
1546 2018-12-15 20:46:12 In emerging markets, your small/value allocation within stocks has mattered more than your allocation between stocks and bonds.

1549 2018-12-15 20:44:45 Ah, time to bring fear to all the normies who "dabble in stocks"

The elite are PISSED and they are intent on ruining the Trump administration and the mandate for power of the alt right.
1550 2018-12-15 20:44:17 I don't understand what you mean. Index selling begets selling in the stocks that move indexes. Why is that unusual?
1551 2018-12-15 20:43:43 In international developed markets, your small/value allocation within stocks has mattered more than your stock/bond allocation.

1981-2018
Barclays Intermediate Bond Index = +7.0%
MSCI World ex-US = +8.5%
DFA Int’l Small Value Index = +13.4%
1552 2018-12-15 20:43:41 Enjoyed the Podcast Justin, I’m quite heavy on resource stocks, I shall give some serious consideration to diversifying in 2019
1553 2018-12-15 20:43:38 None of them turned in their bump stocks. There’s hope!
1554 2018-12-15 20:42:11 In the US market, your small/value allocation within stocks has mattered more than your mix of stocks and bonds!

1973-2018

DFA US Targeted Value Index = +14.7%
1555 2018-12-15 20:42:04 Bad guidance. Fails to take into consideration that this whole cycle has been built off stocks being bought every time prices drop due to EFTs. Vanguard and Blackrock algorithms aren’t going to miss out on “stellar deals” due to the overvalued market being purchase basis.
1556 2018-12-15 20:41:51 We talked about stocks rarely lead more the 1 bull market. F.A.N.G @FB. broke out early 2013 I know press says bull market since 2009. Well there wrong 2011 & 2015 had 20 % declines growth more
1557 2018-12-15 20:40:06 #Bonds and #stocks can both be analyzed for their underlying value. That isn't so with #gold or #bitcoin. As soon as you run out of buyers, the value drops. That is true of all #currencies as well.
1558 2018-12-15 20:39:14 The S&P 500 earnings yield is now the highest since the 2010-2012 period.  Had you bought stocks then, you'd be smiling today (not so much this quarter though).
1559 2018-12-15 20:39:05 Since he sat in releasing the opinion,’I’m curious to know if he or any of his clerks sold any healthcare stocks before he released the opinion , cause they’re going to crash in Monday.

1585 2018-12-15 20:12:04 Unconstitutional? Remember when you said our gun rights were safe with you, then you moved to try and ban bump stocks and have done jack shit to implement national reciprocity? Yea, you’re not the right person to comment on the constitutionality of anything.
1586 2018-12-15 20:10:39 That would be when they're paid in stock; the stocks are taxed when they are cashed in, not when they are issued.
1587 2018-12-15 20:09:38 As always, great analysis and open mind. Just wondering what would be the probability of stocks sell off to 2016 levels? That's another 20% down to S&P 2100.
1588 2018-12-15 20:09:11 I heard Schitt is scared schittless because his Standard stocks are falling. This is the reason he needs open borders, much easier for him to replenish his stock of young immigrants.
1589 2018-12-15 20:08:42 The people who are holding coins for extended periods of time are dumb. The only way to crypto effectively at this point in time is to day trade the coins with high volume.

1591 2018-12-15 20:05:08 2018 should have been a very good year, because the #Trump #taxcuts significantly benefited businesses. But instead of expanding their #business and hiring more people, companies added those savings to their bottom line. Good for #stocks, not great for people.

1596 2018-12-15 19:59:56 In recent history which of the two situations led a Europe to the brink of collapse?

1.) An influx of immigrants 

Or

2.) The racist ideology that some stocks of man are ‘purer’ and therefore better than other ‘dirty’ stocks.

1609 2018-12-15 19:46:46 Hard to think of an asset class that has comparable gains to CA #cannabis stocks.

1612 2018-12-15 19:44:30 Lots of DMs asking me, how is it possible these value companies trade at such a huge discount to true value... 

Stocks rarely trade on fundamentals in the short run, they trade on supply/demand of buyers and sellers, THAT SIMPLE! 

In the long run, VALUE ALWAYS EMERGES! #STOCKS

1622 2018-12-15 19:37:44 FANG STOCKS have been beaten up recently.  But even after recent losses, Netflick is up 39% and Amazon up 36% for the year.  But twitter is the big winner, up 49%.  Facebook is the big loser down 18%.  Alphabet down 4%.   I have mixed feeling on these stocks and am staying away.

1630 2018-12-15 19:29:04 I don't think you can compare now to the last two BUBBLES. and if you look at most of the stocks now, one by one. They almost all got good/solid fundamentals and good earnings. BUT, the sentiment in the market is bad.
1631 2018-12-15 19:28:16 I'm holding 50-60% cash for next few years. I think 2019 is a crapshoot either massive rally or recession 2nd half. Either way 2020 and 2021 don't seem great.  By keeping high cash balance youll be able to buy next AMZN FB NFLX growth type stocks for 10 cents on the dollar.
1632 2018-12-15 19:23:50 Medicare for all will not address the foremost problem regarding healthcare today and that is the cost of medications imposed on us by the pharmaceutical companies. How many of our lawmakers have a self interest in these big pharma stocks?
1633 2018-12-15 19:23:14 So you're a value investor... ala Warren Buffett... cool... based on the small number of stocks on @theJSEInvestor ... and the large amount of money chasing stocks... do you find it hard to undervalued equities
1634 2018-12-15 19:22:28 Exactly my point guruji JBS  LTCG kind of killed my invest money growth both inMF and stocks, that idiot Adhia said making money in stock market is easy, another observation no ads on MF recently either on radio or tv
1635 2018-12-15 19:21:41 2019. Stocks -40%+ FED says emergency. QE, buy stks. Whatever it takes. Bonds collapse, gold explodes. End point is #Weimar as fiat is a burning building. SDR and reset fail. Gold and cryptos new currency. New dollar backed by gold. Timing could take up to 2028.
1636 2018-12-15 19:21:15 Are we still proud to have a sociopath illegitimate ruler terrorising we the people, while living like a true bandit/pirate making money on money while living off the public payroll?
No one must ever again be allowed on any ballot who won’t disinvestment from business or stocks.
1637 2018-12-15 19:19:59 I'm supportive of your overaching view. Re stocks, I think a proper correction happens if the FED makes a mistake. The correction itself a manifestation of the signal to the FED. If they go dovish (pause) then monetary policy is at a sweet spot, which limits sentiment downside
1638 2018-12-15 19:18:11 I dont know when was the last time, i scanned for 200sma trades. I still have few stocks left. Once i get stopped out on those, my P&L will be around 9% negative YTD. $VIX over $15 killed me big time.
1639 2018-12-15 19:17:37 Yes that’s what I meant. Abellio might not make a profit in this franchise. XC still under 2007s contract so they are making profits but going to shareholders mainly. Rolling stocks are govt choices.

1651 2018-12-15 19:08:54 Cannot argue with any of this Scott. In fact, I can actually add a few reasons to be bearish. I am having difficulty finding reasons to own stocks right now....
1652 2018-12-15 19:08:28 How do u predict moves for stocks? Do you use Elliott wave?
1653 2018-12-15 19:06:49 ...not until after the appeals to the Texas judge's decision are adjudicated, or maybe never.  Until then, status quo. It seems to me the best thing that could happen to the GOP (and my taxes and healthcare stocks) and country is for SCOTUS to overturn the Texas decision.
1654 2018-12-15 19:05:20 Yeah that didn't help their stocks.
1655 2018-12-15 19:05:14 I still got the dream that stocks will be on the blockchain. Will happen some day.
1656 2018-12-15 19:03:52 And this what I got punished for with fake cases by the #SECP too. I made 34 analysis between 2013 and 2015 on pakistani stocks and posted them for all on #FB. 33 went up above 200% on the average. 1 only went up 60%. And that according to them was misleading the investors. Lol.
1657 2018-12-15 19:01:39 ALL work shld be valued. Ppl deserve a living wage. Instead Corp get huge tax cuts & use the $ 2buy back stocks & give higher share of their money  2CEOs instead of their workers aka profit creators. No one working FT shld live in poverty.
1658 2018-12-15 19:01:14 They made a nice hire and didn’t announce it.  This team self deals and is inept!  In my career, bad management = bad stocks!  $OSTK is no exception!  Blockchain is legit and beyond that, flip a coin
1659 2018-12-15 19:00:28 Well... I'm not wealthy enough to have stocks or pensions or mutual funds or even a 401k, no company I've worked for EVER used a tax break to return better wages or benefits to workers, so... I'd rather gov just give my tax $$ directly back to me, not the CEOs.

1664 2018-12-15 18:56:30 12/15 BANK STOCKS took a beating because of concerns of reduced business due to the slowing world economies and concern that the Federal Reserve is going to back off on interest rate increases (bank do better when interest rates are higher).   I'm staying away.
1665 2018-12-15 18:55:50 Désorganiser profondément les réseaux de transports, les voies de communications forment le sang du système capitaliste. Les stocks sont sur les routes. Bloquer cette circulation et en particulier les autoroutes et l'économie agonise en quelques jours. #GiletsJaunes
1666 2018-12-15 18:55:46 Chances of a bear market for stocks are falling, really.
1667 2018-12-15 18:54:15 I don’t agree with defensive stock mentality in poor markets...overwhelming most get taken down w the ship and opportunity to exploit few upward stocks can be difficult
1668 2018-12-15 18:53:34 So where do investors look to if both bonds and stocks are to fail? Gold and Silver after fees make little just keep it safe but cash makes some interest and no one is talking about the dollar collapsing.

1670 2018-12-15 18:53:10 I own several funds that hold stocks and real estate then Global real estate funds also. I like to diversify within a sector. I may have a dozen funds but I look for discount to NAV. No I don’t currently own, too close to 52 wk high. It made a great run.
1671 2018-12-15 18:52:05 Of course. Print money. Have fed buy stocks. Have taxpayer bailouts. Cut interest rates. Problem solved.

1675 2018-12-15 18:49:29 You aren't seriously suggesting Russia is in any fit state to take on the USA/NATO for more than a few weeks? Most equipment is legacy, & missile stocks are past their use by dates and failures are high. Putin is all mouth when it comes to NATO. Not even playing on the same board
1676 2018-12-15 18:48:11 No one thinks we are till bottom. When every talking head says we are in one, that's when to start buying stocks again.
1677 2018-12-15 18:46:47 If you're simply buying their time, you can't expect them to take any risk. If you decide to sell them some of the risk, *one way* to pay for it is by giving stocks. Choose any strategy you can/want, just understand the transactions you're making. That's all I said. 2/2

1688 2018-12-15 18:39:43 DM Kar . We used to have a stocks wa group.
1689 2018-12-15 18:39:34 How is it different? Online gaming, stocks, even gold and silver. Such narrow minded thinking, total goons.
1690 2018-12-15 18:37:04 About their 1 and only group and literally don't care what happens to other groups. People tried boycotting a company a few months ago because they threw out 2 artist because they were dating. Their stocks dropped heavily and they immediately changed their minds, but in the end
1691 2018-12-15 18:36:06 Nope. $390 would be a logical limit. But hype stocks can easily overshoot 10%. So dont buy knockouts or short. You can add a few long running puts every ten or twenty dollars it goes up.
1692 2018-12-15 18:35:27 Earlier this year (and especially last) a 1% move in stocks would require an explanation. Friday, a 2% fall was met with a shrug and collective assumption that this was the new natural state of the market.
1693 2018-12-15 18:35:17 FANG stocks are in beartrend.  $SPX is down 12% from high, that is far far away from a beartrend. Stop acting black or white. If S&P goes up for 10 years, why play the bear? Go where the money is. If we go bearish, I will short with you. Friends?
1694 2018-12-15 18:34:37 HEALTHCARE STOCKS FACE HUGE UNCERTAINTY: Federal judge ruled Obamacare is unconstitutional.  And democrats talking about universal healthcare.  Ugly.
1695 2018-12-15 18:33:44 It’s America they can do whatever they want! But look at dicks academy stores! Their stocks have gone down and so have their sales! I guess pacific wants the same and as a patriot I stand behind America not pacific! 
1696 2018-12-15 18:33:05 And the Liberals aren”t? You might want to look at the gropegate, the cabinet minister under investigation by the RCMP, Morneau forgetting he owns a place overseas, the fact that both he and his father sold stocks just a couple days before they changed the rules etc, ethics guilt
1697 2018-12-15 18:32:13 Back when I began option trading a couple of months ago, I played around with JD puts, too. Currently, I‘m watching some German stocks like BASF, Covestro, Daimler and Fresenius to sell put options on. Let’s see, maybe I’ll put the trigger next week.
1698 2018-12-15 18:31:47 Dalton Risner comes to mind....but i think his stocks will rise as it gets closer to the draft
1699 2018-12-15 18:31:39 12/15: I'm avoiding Healthcare related stocks.  Judge just ruled Obamacare was unconstitutional jeopardizing healthcare coverage for 20 million.  Pharmaceuticals down 9% for year, Biotech down 10% after declining 25% in last quarter.  Healthcare been falling, but up 7% for year
1700 2018-12-15 18:29:59 It was a transfer of wealth which created winners and losers. It also taxed capital gains on stocks which infuriated the wealthy. They can’t start letting the peasants have anything. 
1701 2018-12-15 18:29:56 Danno, have you ever heard of the rich taking profits to drop the market? Then reinvesting to let the stocks rise again? The idea of Stocks as they are not seem to be more of a Ponzi scheme than Social Security.
1702 2018-12-15 18:29:53 Ce n'est pas ce que je dis. Tous les éléments ne sont manifestement pas présentés pour que la situation puisse être pleinement évaluée. On nous présente des flux d'argent, mais les critiques parlent de stocks. Qu'en est-il de l'endettement de ce couple par exemple ?

1707 2018-12-15 18:27:22 but where are the stocks? at Chennai Phoenix mall.. all earphones are sold out. I travelled a good distance to get disappointed. I suggest that you need a very big Super Market like space to sell your products. the Present one is only 1/10th  of the required space! Please do it..
1708 2018-12-15 18:24:46 I know exactly what your saying. And what I'm saying is that without proper context, impossible to infer why systematic selling is taking place—especially with ALL stocks immersed in bear market conditions. Your skepticism is certainly valid and warranted though, Mr. Wats.

1718 2018-12-15 18:18:17 Spend only what you need. Invest, if you are afraid of stocks, look into investing in life insurance policies as well. Make money now, invest for future. I hate seeing people making good money and blowing it, forgetting about future and retirement.
1719 2018-12-15 18:17:16 So, what's Dedric Lawson's problem? Mobile four, combined stocks% over 5.0, passes, rebounds, decent 2P%, great moves around the basket from what I'm seeing here against Villanova. Can he really not shoot from range? Wasn't an utter non-shooter at Memphis.
1720 2018-12-15 18:16:00 Excellent working - Hoping Market gives that PE to GE stocks soon
1721 2018-12-15 18:15:53 Sorry Peter. But you can lose just as much in stocks, commodities, and forex.  I’ve made and lost far more than you ever did in crypto in commodities. Bottom line is you can risk it all in any market or even casino or online poker. Everyone needs to reconcile themselves.
1722 2018-12-15 18:15:09 Both stocks are beaten down to very low PEs so a rip on Wednesday wouldn’t surprise me at all. And could spark a rally in Transports and Semis.

1724 2018-12-15 18:14:50 You get it. Our work is driven by identifying & investing in the stocks that excel. We are not market-timers. Never will be. Our index  strategy is focused on building superior stock portfolio, dynamic adjustments (sector, market-cap, geography agnostic) and large loss avoidance.
1725 2018-12-15 18:14:45 Great point.  People see the falling attendance or low ratings but don't understand what it means because the only place they ever learned about these metrics was the Monday Night War.  Also,they ignore modern metrics like yearly revenue, which is higher than ever.  Stocks too.
1726 2018-12-15 18:14:37 thinking about influencers selling stocks to people who respond to Kardashian FitTea posts. someone doing a bathroom selfie with a gift basket full of IBM stock like: "WOW! You guys HAVE to buy this stock, I am seeing AMAZING RETURNS  use my promo code on Robinhood!" awful

1729 2018-12-15 18:12:24 I'm not sure if I mean invest everything into alpacas meaning stocks or just buying a lot of land and a bunch of animals and becoming an alpaca farmer. Being an alpaca farmer seems like a cozy job.
1730 2018-12-15 18:12:12 If you pick an apple from an orchard, or from my garden, that's illegal.

Fish stocks have to be managed by laws to avoid overfishing, as has happened in many places and is happening right now in many more.

1735 2018-12-15 18:08:05 @BlizzardCSEU_EN At which point do you stop calling yourself Blizzard and just go with Activision? Activision takes the reins, messes things up, stocks go down, Activision takes more control because stocks went down because of their antics. Seems like a general theme currently.
1736 2018-12-15 18:07:04 Yes, private stocks during early startup stage have a much higher growth rate. For e.g. Facebook, Uber during early years.

1738 2018-12-15 18:04:44 Stocks broke key level on Friday and could aim for the year's low

The S&P 500 broke the psychological 2,600 level and closed at a lower low, setting the stage for a possible retest of a new range above the 2018 low of 2,532 which is 3 percent below current levels.

Was it realistic when BTC rose by ~$1000 in one day?
I believe "Realistic" doesn't apply to crypto markets.
If this was stocks/equities I'd agree with ya.

1759 2018-12-15 17:48:07 That's exactly what many seniors do w/ the HoG. They defer, take the cash & invest it in stocks or other investment vehicles. That needs to be income tested - it's basically free money at low interest.
1760 2018-12-15 17:46:31 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your depression
1761 2018-12-15 17:46:10 No I think even fishing for leave accepted they will have to conserve stocks that issue is that they don't get any while the foreign vessels do
1762 2018-12-15 17:45:32 Shorts in sub penny stocks is a myth.
1763 2018-12-15 17:45:18 Mostly Royal Dutch Shell puts, also a few on Unilever. Boring and stable stocks to collect my premium on and eventually buy a few shares. I'm really looking to learn more about it, and currently experimenting with JD and Alibaba shares.
1764 2018-12-15 17:45:01 James, under UN Law we will still have to conserve stocks. That means quotas on a per species basis, which in turn means returning some catches to the sea. Regrettable, but significant research effort goes into minimising this.
1765 2018-12-15 17:45:01 Just had that in 2 games in a row. People were on there last stock, died and still came back. Result screen even stated they lost their full 3 stocks lol
1766 2018-12-15 17:44:50 i love @jamescharles but like, a concept: james only stocks 500 pallets per restock to hype up the palette and make it seem more desirable (basically creating a faux supply and demand imbalance). this would explain why he can never “legally say” how many pallets they sold.
1767 2018-12-15 17:44:37 OTC released an article debunking the myth of shorts in sub penny stocks. There are no shorts.

1773 2018-12-15 17:41:03 I've been writing a lot of puts on Dutch stocks Im interested in owning. Also a few short strangles on my Unilever position. Got any tips? I'm still relatively new to earning extra money with options.
1774 2018-12-15 17:40:52 So... is it normal that people don't lose stocks sometimes in Online Smash despite dying?

1777 2018-12-15 17:37:33 I am down 4,26 in $BTC, thanks to other coins than Bitcoin :) The $ amount is down a lot too, but I don't care about that. Bought 1,04 BTC again a few weeks ago. I like it when it's cheap! Considering moving some money from stocks, but already have a good position at risk.

1779 2018-12-15 17:36:26 Wall Street taking money before Christmas !! I’ve been talking about over-valued stocks and media stocks !! It will be back up to 27,000 before the end of January !!
1780 2018-12-15 17:36:08 Hoping the tax loss selling is done. A lot of ppl selling #Uranium stocks as it’s one of the few sectors that made money this year. Lots of losses, why not offset with a potentially free gain.. I hope January looks much prettier 
1781 2018-12-15 17:32:59 1/2 **Lets see:
- punishment for pre-existing conditions (including veterans!)
-corporations using $$ to buy back their own stocks rather than employees 
-More gerrymandering of state elections 
-Streets full of #WhiteSupremacists
-total loss of stock market “win”
1782 2018-12-15 17:32:01 With the combine wealth of the people in this country. We could have helped everyone instead the rich helped the rich now stocks are falling a change is coming
1783 2018-12-15 17:31:16 They said buy more stocks and that's what I'm going do
1784 2018-12-15 17:31:00 Peter Lynch - "The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them."
1785 2018-12-15 17:29:21 I have bought few yesterday to my existing holding...Infact no plans to sell as this is one of my FD stocks .
1786 2018-12-15 17:29:13 You do realize that Doug kass bought all his long back two weeks later, right? he's been screaming to buy Bank stocks for months. He's been killed. And besides that, kass said to short the S&P essentially every week since late 2009. Was he drunk when he tweeted this? LOL
1787 2018-12-15 17:26:47 It works by depositing money to your RH account, then using the balance to buy stocks, so no margin trading unless you pay for gold, but it's not necessary.
1788 2018-12-15 17:26:44 if yall did not invest in french yellow vest stocks you missin out
1789 2018-12-15 17:26:34 LOL. you do realize he loaded back up two weeks later, right?? he's been screaming to buy bank stocks for months. He's down massively. Who is kass trying to fool. His narcissism is causing him to post absurd tweets
1790 2018-12-15 17:25:26 I mean these margins aren’t as crazy as the old days but better than stocks and savings accounts. Ross clearance flips have decent margin but you can’t push hella volume unless you commit a lot of time.
1791 2018-12-15 17:25:19 Pipedream: The "It's Definitely Not Stocks" hint is Magdala de Nemure cause it's not about a merchant/as economic heavy as S&W. ......Please, someone get Magdala, I wanna read more Isuna Hasekura I say even though I haven't finished S&W.

1793 2018-12-15 17:24:10 What the Fed 'hints' at in 2019 will be key to how the market trades from here. This is a very important week because the Fed decision coincides with tax loss selling. What will they do? #Fed #stocks #investing
1794 2018-12-15 17:23:46 Trump "U", Obama's book outsells yours, Trump vodka, Trump Airlines, all your casinos, Trump steaks, 4 bankruptcies, 2 failed marriages, 10 of the 20 largest drops in hx of stocks are YOURS, kids under investigation for fraud... jesus, dude. Get a grip on yourself.
1795 2018-12-15 17:23:14 On Friday cob all S&P and Nasdaq indices rebalance all of the members (stocks) back to their benchmark weights.  

In addition, index futures expire on the open.

It will be one of the heaviest volume days of the year.
1796 2018-12-15 17:21:58 I literally give zero fucks about the gold part.  The part where the elite class claims they have to inflate assets to keep the plebs from revolting is bang on.  He also talks about drooler behavior in the beginning...buying stocks that are going BK in 30 days.
1797 2018-12-15 17:21:24 stocks  will crash monday .,
1798 2018-12-15 17:21:01 I don't do stocks, this was to show the only dow stocks that rose on Friday. I do the SPX meaning the ES futures which is a commodity index for the SPX
1799 2018-12-15 17:20:41 NOBODY in Congress Exec Branch or SCOTUS should own stocks period. 2much conflict of interest. Maybe IndexFunds but thats all. That said, most CEOs r corrupt & most of Congress is corrupt so whats the big deal. Not all but most. $WFC isnt the problem. Their CEO was the problem
1800 2018-12-15 17:18:46 I reckon you could take their money, invest it in some AIM stocks and do a rev share with them 12 months later.  Guaranteed success

1804 2018-12-15 17:15:49 Long or short has to be neither optimistic or pessimistic. Reality is investing,trading the stocks or market that is, not what you want it to be. Focus on a proven process, positive results are the reward either way, up or down is irrelevant!

MOST VOLATILE YEAR...
1807 2018-12-15 17:13:46 One thing I find interesting.
Lot of stocks are trading at a discount...this doesn't remind me of 2000 at all.
1808 2018-12-15 17:13:25 Yep - the prices simply reflect a corrupt, crime ridden economy - let the beneficiaries pay some of their ill gotten gains. Not comparable to stocks unless you're talking about the VSE days...
1809 2018-12-15 17:09:31 What is the need of trolling someone for no reason? Stocks are down doesn’t mean he need to find bargain deals. Its a good habit boy
1810 2018-12-15 17:09:15 See you in stocks on sunday an ill re enact this full scene hahahaha
1811 2018-12-15 17:09:00 Even in last 2-3 years some of the FMCG stocks were available at decent valuations(not all) & before 2013 some of the stocks were expensive,if you are stick to few sectors valuation part is easy.
1812 2018-12-15 17:09:00 Exactly and people are better off only trading them if the technicals indicate a move otherwise it’a not advised. It’s similarly to people holding SP500 ETF’s. Most people were better off holding those as suppose to certain stocks or work with a hedge fund
1813 2018-12-15 17:08:44 If they hike stocks will keep trending down (risky)
If they lower rates investors may panic "Am I missing the recession?" and hit the sell button.
Keeping then steady and blaming Europe deceleration and recent China poor numbers seems reasonable. "We are ok, it is their fault"
1814 2018-12-15 17:05:12 FASP are GGMS stocks that are >20% down from 52wk highs.
1815 2018-12-15 17:04:17 Sub penny stocks are 100% dilution scams and every CEO the same. Lie to sell shares

1822 2018-12-15 16:59:52 In New York, bump stocks — the mechanism used by a Las Vegas mass shooter in 2017 to simulate an automatic weapon — are in something of a gray area.

Weird way of punishing criminals by punishing law abiding citizens.

1827 2018-12-15 16:55:48 You are asking the wild salmon stocks and the communities that protect and depend on them to hang on for 5 more years and hope the aquaculture industry doesn't successfully wipe out it's competition by then.

1830 2018-12-15 16:54:19 You are right. I was not suggesting that...what I mean is the new role Central Banks have taken up. This history isn't much old. And in recent years, the quantum has only magnified. Point is: Nothing stops Central Banks to buy stocks in fear/to prop up market, as BOJ does.

1843 2018-12-15 16:47:44 The risk in any business idea is losing everything you put into realizing it. Stocks represent shared ownership.  You either share both the risk and the reward, or keep both for yourself. You don't *have to* anything.

1851 2018-12-15 16:43:21 It has to be very possible that A50 gets extended whatever eventual Agreements are settled between UK and EU. If this happens and it's long  (1 year +) maybe this could mark the Bottom for Stocks. Think of what happened when ECB announced "everything it takes".
1852 2018-12-15 16:42:39 Glad that you touched upon Fed/ECB. One thought: How relevant is the rear view mirror here when BOJ owns huge stocks with no exit plans/signs of inflation? Past charts vs spread of Central Banks' actions - like how much more debt/balance sheet/scope of cuts: isn't 2018 different?

1864 2018-12-15 16:33:10 very good
1865 2018-12-15 16:31:59 You think when the FED cuts rates stocks will rise? Ha! In Sept 2007 first cut stocks rose ~2.8%, peaked for the cycle and then never got back there and headed down for -56.5% until March 2009. This is public knowledge.
1866 2018-12-15 16:30:20 No issues. There are much better & cleaner opportunities than these 4. 

Also #nifty at sub 10k levels will drastically increase opportunities. No hurry to rush into stocks.
1867 2018-12-15 16:29:52 You got 2 choices. Keep this bubble up, but the gravity will bring it down harder once you try to prop up this bubble. Longer you keep it going harder for US Bonds and $. Once you allow to crash stocks, US Bonds will get all those money and US can spend another 10T$ deficits.

1869 2018-12-15 16:28:21 Devs also normally get nothing if the company makes it big. The reward is distributed according to the risk. Which is exactly how it should be. It's amazing you don't understand this... If you want devs to take more risk you'll have to give them more rewards (stocks?).
1870 2018-12-15 16:25:48 Last 2 rate hikes of the prior hiking cycle led to -7.5% before starting to turn around. And it took months to recover. The last hike drifted stocks lower by 3% over the next few weeks. Things then bounced because Growth and Inflation hadn't peaked yet....They have peaked now!

Macron avait fait acheter des stocks monstrueux de lacrymo dans la foulée de son élection, il avait déjà anticipé ce qui se passe depuis un mois, sachant que sa politique de merde ne passerait pas pendant 5 ans.
1878 2018-12-15 16:18:21 The three major U.S. stock Indexes have all fallen more than 10% from their recent highs, enough to be considered a market correction. And it’s worse for financial stocks, often a market leader: The sector is down 20%, putting it in bear-market territory.
1879 2018-12-15 16:17:32 But we are increasingly not buying stocks, not buying homes and when the bubble pops we will be there to scoop up your assets for pennies on the dollar and the boomers can live in our unfinished basements.

1883 2018-12-15 16:11:33 Ok. Until then let’s go with the conservative line of thinking from 2012, 2015, 2018 and likely 2021 that “criminals don’t follow laws.” Let’s continue to make it as easy as possible for untrained/irresponsible people to buy AR-15’s, hi-cap mags, bump stocks, etc. That’ll help.

1885 2018-12-15 16:11:20 And if you are concerned about more jobs, you should have tied that tax cut to hiring numbers. What they got was money to buy their stocks back, make the CEO’s more money and not have to add jobs. The rich get richer, and the republicans blame the poor people.

1895 2018-12-15 16:08:12 Is anyone else interested that @tumblr has gone radio silent since their new T&C's oh and plummet in stocks? I'm still leaving if they are going to leave their stupid T&C's. When someone finds an alt site I can sign up for let me know!
1896 2018-12-15 16:07:32 My year in trading summed up: I nailed the call in February to load up on Utility stocks. I slowly exited those positions in November when $XLU was around $55. I then went short when Utes fwd p/e (17x) was higher than Every market sector. Utes are now at $57 and I’m frustrated 
1897 2018-12-15 16:07:08 Fair’s fair. My school retained some stocks in the playground for exactly this sort of behaviour.
1898 2018-12-15 16:06:59 Thanks for the prompt reply. There’s always a lot of debate on whether stocks are over or under valued. It’s a relative term & accidents do keep happening at regular intervals.The wisest choice to survive a transition is knowledge & processes that I am sure you already have them
1899 2018-12-15 16:06:40 Stocks going higher.
1900 2018-12-15 16:06:33 Only software stocks holding up very good. $MDB is the leader. But this can change anytime.
1901 2018-12-15 16:06:17 Have to take a bow at Rakesh jhunjhunwala. Inspite of Most of his stocks down by 60-70% this guy never stops being bullish or never speaks anything against Govt and always speaks as if India is Growing at 10%. Need to know secret behind the same
1902 2018-12-15 16:06:05 Homework done. Removed some stocks from my watchlist and see nothing which is interesting. Bad environment, currently.

1904 2018-12-15 16:04:20 treasuries and gold have gone up during this steep drop in btc and stocks.  Just stay diversified in all 4 and u will be fine imo
1905 2018-12-15 16:03:12 I used them for stocks but I’m kinda skeptical. I think ima wait a minute.
1906 2018-12-15 16:03:06 Corrupt WS is gonna burn & hang for keeping stocks from selling off.  Watch!!!!  : ]
1907 2018-12-15 16:02:25 The 10 year was at 69 times yield in 2016. Now its at 35 times. Are stocks cheap? Do the fucking math.
1908 2018-12-15 15:59:50 financial markets are always intense. crypto is not that much different than stocks just faster. i mean if you can’t stand the heat, leave, and get out of the kitchen.
1909 2018-12-15 15:58:15 Know what you guys mean... Sold off most everything til further notice and just trying to catch short-term pops on non descript stocks with a story to keep sharp and pick up a little lunch money
1910 2018-12-15 15:58:13 @9whitedeer any idea who stocks your stag saor red ale in Dublin? Tried a few super valu’s and o briens but no joy. Thanks
1911 2018-12-15 15:55:00 What utter bullshit, Donald. Ryan Zinke did not serve our nation, and should be put in stocks in the town square, right next to you.
1912 2018-12-15 15:53:52 Ok, I think I've concluded something

If you play online, if you play against someone who is doing 2 stocks, 6 minutes. They're either a melee player, or a washed up smash 4 player

if they play 2 stocks 3-5 minutes. They have no clue what they're doing.
1913 2018-12-15 15:53:37 Too many “experts” believe you can start a trade war btw the two largest economies, make a deal, & everything can go back to normal.
Trump said he started it b/c stocks are up but didn’t consider end of QE, China slowing, Brexit, rate hikes, $DB, Mueller, etc.
All at once.
1914 2018-12-15 15:52:50 Those stopped the day of the Brexit vote..  Green shoots in the Summer is my prediction but a lot of pain to come,  including likely a mini crash and recession but just think how cheap stocks will be come July/August which you should keep powder dry for..

I have real positions in stocks which i m tweeting.
Else i dont tweet..but all do have their own risk capacity.
1916 2018-12-15 15:51:54 Bitcoin. Pot stocks, FAANG. 2019 may not be as bad as many think cuz they are focusing on the short term headline grabbers of today.
1917 2018-12-15 15:50:06 Of course he won’t. Slimy politician like all the others. If it does go badly wrong he’s got to be ‘on the list’ of people to go in the stocks and suffer the ritual humiliation of being showered with rotten fruit for a week or two
1918 2018-12-15 15:49:28 That’s actually the strat, you bait your opponent into thinking you’re somewhat good at the game with squirtle and ivysaur, and then you just throw out a raw flare blitz to end stocks
1919 2018-12-15 15:49:25 Hello, mas okay ba kung mag direct ka na lang magpaship from kor if stocks are available kesa bumili dyan sa rob manila?
1920 2018-12-15 15:48:30 Well in Wall St we buy stocks from companies we believe will make profits from their services or products they sell.
1921 2018-12-15 15:46:52 Dear Jim Cramer, stop saying you “predicted the 2008 GFC.” Theres hours of footage of you recommending to your viewers that they buy bank stocks in 2007. Bear Sterns was labeled a “Buy” 2 weeks before it collapsed.

It’s OKAY to be wrong, but it’s not okay to blatantly lie.
1922 2018-12-15 15:44:47 Sorry. Your company puts in you put in. The people who manage your 401k is to blame on how they invest your stocks. Lost 2 401k's because someone else managed mine poorly. Gaf nothing to do with a president.
1923 2018-12-15 15:44:09 Why would you do that? Why would anyone ever do that? Is fighting crowds and complaining about out of stocks that fun?

(also stop deleting tweets as I reply to them ;-;)
1924 2018-12-15 15:44:06 My stocks say otherwise...
1925 2018-12-15 15:43:38 Maybe if you hadn’t sold all of your stocks before the great Bull run, you could have paid for your own damn healthcare.
1926 2018-12-15 15:43:31 10 years in crypto equals 50 years in stocks if not more
1927 2018-12-15 15:43:27 It is trading If I buy BTC here & wait for it to hit $100k before I sell some. Read your own post. It reads as though buying crypto is too risky. it’s not any more risky than stocks & many other assets. Your sob story reads the same as those of people who bought property in 2007.
1928 2018-12-15 15:43:21 Cheif, I got my nose out for the news a long time ago. Stocks are down, gas prices down blah blah. In the real world we are prospering, jobs and more business than we ever had!!! I don’t care what they say but can only go by what I see! This is great!
1929 2018-12-15 15:43:13 Some individual stocks hit circuit breaker first before the index

1941 2018-12-15 15:34:23 There was knee jerk reaction by the market. Didnt say it didn't cause issues. But pricing right now with current stocks isnt far off. Go back 4 or 5 years. We were here before.
1942 2018-12-15 15:34:14 It's Christmas. No one made any money this year. I don't think anyone will buy bitcoin now. Even stocks are going down. I hope bitcoin hits 1000.

The last time we opened our shop / treasury for thieves. So much was lost and almost shutdown the economy.

Protect your shop and avoid distractions.

1955 2018-12-15 15:23:39 C’est pas au menu du week-end. On reconstitue les stocks.
1956 2018-12-15 15:23:29 I hope you have a pity party at the fall of your leader.  As you do, I will buy stocks, because I will get them for a bargain, as the market continues to crash.
1957 2018-12-15 15:21:46 Shouldn’t be targeting stocks. But what should be alarming them is the velocity of the rise in credit spreads, drop in CLO’s, PMI’s, short term funding, and inflation. They continue to disregard the lagged effects of every hike which is why they’ve always zigged as economy zagged
1958 2018-12-15 15:20:54 someone said up to dec. 30, i'm not sure about that, or until the stocks are sold out. Someone said that the staffs didn't know until when will be the bt21 pop up stores 
1959 2018-12-15 15:20:38 reminder that Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure only exists because The ITT Corporation helped the CIA to overthrow the president of Guatemala and nd saw a significant drop in stocks so They decided to invest in a piece of major entertainment to quickly recoup their losses

1961 2018-12-15 15:18:45 Do you buy a drill at $100 or $50?  Do you buy a washer/dryer at $500 or $300?  why would you want to pay more for stocks when you can pay less?  When the market rises again you your number of shares increases and you make a profit.
1962 2018-12-15 15:18:38 Sorry there cannot be a simple one size fits all example. But as your example above, not all stocks have dividends, if they do, there is another valuation metric, but I think your asking how to value a start up that may have a security, and that's a completely different topic.

1965 2018-12-15 15:16:13 @MikeBellafiore  I recently transitioned over the last 3 months to trading the same 6 stocks every day that give enough range to be great daytrading stocks for me with solid results.  I am starting to really get familiar with their price behavior. Your thoughts?

2004 2018-12-15 14:45:40 Those who know John Malone’s history, know that the stocks he owns never trade at a discount for long—he is the master at unlocking shareholder and personal value. While his company strategy is complex, you cannot argue with the results.

2007 2018-12-15 14:43:27 I am not. I trade many markets. Crypto has been off my radar as a trader for a long time. I would say in the last 6 months my trades are literally 99% stocks, 1% crypto
2008 2018-12-15 14:42:17 Expectations were that sales would drop by half.....

Without doing any research I'd guess that the stock is being propped up by the CCP....same as the $2.733 Trillion Chinese (as of Feb 2018)  Chinese stocks on US exchanges......
2009 2018-12-15 14:42:12 Insurance companies wrote the ACA.  You were fooled.  Obama comes out railing against them only to con you.  Their stocks shot up.  I was at a meeting with the former ceo of kaiser and he flat out said he helped write the bill.  Merger of Corp and state equals fascism.
2010 2018-12-15 14:41:57 Ya know I’ve been thinking that too like what would it take to learn stocks
2011 2018-12-15 14:41:48 I've just posted a new blog: Investors Have Nowhere to Hide as Stocks, Bonds and Commodities All Tumble
2012 2018-12-15 14:41:09 just stop. That's exactly what happened when ACA was enacted & why health care stocks rallied. Dont even try to avoid the cronyism and political favors throughout that bill.
2013 2018-12-15 14:40:57 We did have a large harvest but if China was buying as usual, our stocks would not be as large.

2017 2018-12-15 14:39:58 They just said they considered it,& because we can't imagine a world without them we panicked &  it got out of hand,

Also BH is going public & that's must be more pressure for them they r their only bg hence every of their mistakes could influence the stocks,that's why it's hard

2021 2018-12-15 14:34:23 Okay got it, thanks. Sorry if this sounds silly but what does this chart tell us that the big players are doing with their big money? Does the big drop show that they are essentially pulling the money out of the markets/stocks, or what? Also, why?

2049 2018-12-15 14:06:49 Price doesn’t matter at all, it’s in market cap.

Everything in this world has market cap. Gold, stocks, commodities, currencies, etc.

Stock X is worth $200 a share, since it’s market cap is 1T each share would hold that value. (1T/circulating coins/shares = $200)

2059 2018-12-15 14:00:15 I’ve read a few books that describe stocks as random. By definition this is wrong and annoying. Here’s how a random stock might trade $10, $156.43, $2, -$122.44, $1,456, $22, $667. That’s a pattern I would describe as random. Stocks may be unpredictable but NOT random. #trading

2104 2018-12-15 13:24:02 @jimcramer I love when your show professor especially “are you diversified”. How about doing a segment “ is your dividend safe.”  For those of us who own stocks that pay higher dividends.  Just a thought.
2105 2018-12-15 13:23:18 I could see a 10% gain in stocks in 2019.....if we start at 2200 in the S&P.

2111 2018-12-15 13:16:24 If you and China reach an tariff agreement suggest others review it first. Your track record only benefits the 1% and leaves crumbs for the others.  The trickledown affects isn’t working.  Instead corporations buy back stocks and cutting workforce’s to maximize returns.
2112 2018-12-15 13:11:39 Hmm.. I hate being a downer but I can't help but argue (gently) that we are due for a big correction in stocks in 2019. Unless if's going to be over the next 2-3 years as in 2000-2002. Then, some nice growth. I'm just learning about bonds. Never gave them thought before.

2132 2018-12-15 12:53:03 3 stocks feel sooo right.
2133 2018-12-15 12:52:57 Thank you. Tense is one of the worst offensive in financial journalism.  

That and descriptors.  For example, “stocks.” Does one mean large cap U.S. stocks have risen in December? International stocks? Value stocks? Global? Sloppy.
2134 2018-12-15 12:52:51 Stocks "could" rally 10% says nothing. They also could drop off a cliff, stay flat, whatever. This clown is just talking out his arse.

2137 2018-12-15 12:51:47 For the year through Dec. 13:

Stocks down

Sanctions on Iran entangled with Meng arrest and Trump’s suggestion he might intervene.

Saudi Arabia’s horrific crime. Excused!

And now a health care bomb.

But DT holds on 538 at 42.5%. Keep it supporters.
2138 2018-12-15 12:50:27 Health care stocks down on Monday?
2139 2018-12-15 12:47:37 The problems with this are:
* They want people to think this, and it's easy to do with fake signals.
* These are not stocks; no basis, no rails, etc.
* Star charts (& similar doodles) don't predict anything.
* This is the part of the cycle where Big money accumulates.
* Caps.

2142 2018-12-15 12:41:58 hehe oh I'm sorry!! I'm only going to tweet about taxes and stocks and bonds from now on!!
2143 2018-12-15 12:39:25 There are so many charts floating around that suggest growth investing has outperformed value investing since a decade or two. If one were to buy growth stocks today, one is going to buy them at an expensive price. What's your take?
2144 2018-12-15 12:38:53 Talking about Brexit Mogg said 'Don't worry you can use your stocks, shares,bonds, savings and inheritance' to 'help you through the lean time' Prior to that he said 'the economy will recover in about 50 years' .. How is that sensible ?
2145 2018-12-15 12:38:15 None of my stocks corrects that much! I wish to buy my portfolio again in 50% price. But paint major, car major, consumer finance major, noodles major, cigarette major, biscuit major, infra major etc not correct even 20% !!

Always make #qualityBuy for #LTinvestment
2146 2018-12-15 12:37:16 The market is predicting a slowdown in corporate earnings next year, not a recession.  The market was due for a correction anyway.  And interest rates have been going up, which increases competition for stocks and reduces PE’s.
2147 2018-12-15 12:37:04 No you’re misunderstanding, the debt is $ dominated. What’s affecting China, the biggest commodity consumer is the trade war and they’re generally slowing down. This is what’s hitting resource stocks.
2148 2018-12-15 12:36:44 Having my morning coffee and just read that a Federal judge in Texas ruled that The ACA is unconstitutional.  I hate talking stocks on the weekends but this will cause more pain come Monday in Health Care stocks.  $CNC $MOH $THC $HCA $UHS some but less in $ANTM $WCG $HUM.

2151 2018-12-15 12:34:24 Thank you for your comments which are really helpful in further understanding your books. Every day there still seem to be stocks that are making new highs or breaking out of some base. These breakouts most often seem to evaporate recently. How to recognize a true leader?

2156 2018-12-15 12:31:43 You are also wrong about the majority of Irish landings coming from the UK. Yes, we catch two important a stocks there, mackerel and prawns but they do not represent the majority.
2157 2018-12-15 12:30:18 C'est une question absurde, les stocks sont immenses par rapport à la consommation qu'on en a. Et même si un jour ça devait se finir, il y a d'autres matériaux qui pourraient faire l'affaire (le thorium visiblement a un gros potentiel).

2168 2018-12-15 12:14:00 The only reason why pundits choose to adhere to GDP flows, is because they ignore our planet finitude. Why the hell we should look to stocks of goods and services if planet and Nature is considered irrelevant and inexhaustible? GDP will stay without a change in our value system.

U will shift your assets a few times as the bear cycles between asset classes (maybe marked by interest rate tweaks).    

E.g. stay out of bonds until bond market collapses, then sell ur stocks to buy bonds.

2197 2018-12-15 11:52:18 For the first time in decades, every major type of investment has fared poorly, as the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits is dampened by rising trade tensions and interest rates. Stocks around the world are getting pummeled, while commodities are tumbling.

2226 2018-12-15 11:14:55 If they don’t raise they look like they don’t know what they are doing and market gets scared, if they raise stocks drop another 5%+ next week. They will raise and stocks will drop because confidence is more important than anything else.
2227 2018-12-15 11:13:25 Cheaper ones are not worth it.  Just look at $AMD over past few months dollar plus ranges almost everyday and its less than 5% moves and with the cheaper stocks you need 50 plus moves to get the same reward and then its just gambling or sheep farming #FU2furus

2254 2018-12-15 10:31:35 But I believe that tokens that are linked to the development of the underlying company, and offer the rights of a dividend or the chance to switch tokens into stocks after they went public, can have a value as it becomes measurable. Your opinion?

These are all betting sites in Nigeria that are trying to take your money if you let them! Betting is like picking stocks to invest in!

2283 2018-12-15 09:59:52 Good one. Sir, forget arguments, becoming difficult nowadays to c just the prices of stocks on the net.

2285 2018-12-15 09:58:44 I bet you EA Stocks have dropped more with just a bad game. Surely in time as this gets reported more on it'l dip though. I'd be really surprised if it doesn't lol. this stuff is in most homes over here in the UK.
2286 2018-12-15 09:58:12 I rarely ran into cheese stuff or SDed. But spam battles happen all the time. I would still prefer 2 stocks if I knew before the start if I'm playing a Rob/YL/Richter
2287 2018-12-15 09:57:08 The market and the volume are tiny. Individual companies, stocks have more volume. That's why it can only go forward. I'm just wondering if my chosen project can survive. The idea is good and necessary. But the team is just chasing technology and marketing does not exist.

2293 2018-12-15 09:51:35 During 2018 I was in minority, now majority is singing gloom, recession etc. Time to re-assess. Whatever the Indian & Global indices may do, clearly there are decent opportunities in Indian #stocks, especially mid & smallcaps.
2294 2018-12-15 09:50:46 My top picks in 2018 have all been massive misses/disappointment.

$NZC.AX had down year, cobalt stocks got bloody massacred.

$NEO and $WAN both had stellar interim runs but fell off cliff down over 90% (or more) after crypto hysteria fizzled out.

Specs MUST be traded NOT HODL!
2295 2018-12-15 09:50:23 Yes!! When u go to japan, go to tower records @ shibuya to buy the album instead. it’s way cheaper but i was desperate to get it and their stocks usually arrive a few days later and my trip ends tmr :(
2296 2018-12-15 09:47:00 Cheers mate! Go BGS, was my top pick in 2017 and I’m picking it again in 2019 to outperform. 

Anyone’s guess, but I’m thinking 2020/2021 will be prime time for lithium stocks to shine again.
2297 2018-12-15 09:44:32 I love when *people* (read idiots) say "stocks are a scam its just paper we need gold"

Free markets dictate anything is worth whatever someone will pay be it paper or shiny rocks.

2320 2018-12-15 09:19:34 Oh blimey what a shame!! Sadly we do not have a tracking system to locate stocks in stores.. The best thing to do would be to either call or pop into some other stores & keep an eye online! Buyers always try to get more of items that sell well, so it could pop back up!  Emma

2338 2018-12-15 08:59:39 Ok people, cannot deny this any longer...

The price trends of other auto stocks clearly says the market is confident they will all have a more compelling and profitable EV growth story.

2340 2018-12-15 08:56:34 Every session of Congress should begin behind closed doors with the faces of these precious children and the agony of the aftermath. Maybe when they have to stomach the tragedy daily they'll do more than ban bump stocks.

2367 2018-12-15 08:39:59 Every penny stock has warrants out there convertible within 5 years. And every day there are penny stocks skyrocketing. And very usual that they do that from worst condition ever. When you purchase a penny stock you must know that it for sure has an offering running.

2369 2018-12-15 08:38:37 Sir i always wanted to ask you a question... Do you believe there is intraday manipulation in market?  For ex,  buy index put options then sell index stocks
2370 2018-12-15 08:36:57 Invest a part of your savings, not all the earnings, into stocks: So if you have decided to invest 25% of your savings in stocks, invest 12% to 15% as it is a risky business. Also you should only invest a certain amount based on your risk-taking capacity.

2374 2018-12-15 08:30:15 To have a broad understanding of the market and highlight both good and bad stocks. Be flexible and evolve your opinions and never become emotionally attached otherwise you will end up eating pasties in the bushes.
2375 2018-12-15 08:29:36 Yes...and the way for all the stocks to be stolen is to abandon your shop and run after the thief.

2404 2018-12-15 08:01:24 @robjective 8 businesses use my marking service. Facebook cuts my ads account off without a warning. No wonder stocks are on the decline.
2405 2018-12-15 08:00:30 Objectively, both went in their good way. 

Me: for the case of the shop and criminals - in real life, you need to deal with the criminals so as to be rest assured that your stocks are potentially safe from criminal. Then, you can have the palate to developing your stocks!
2406 2018-12-15 07:57:33 @robjective in a time when Facebook has so many challenges. Stocks tumbling. Pushing ads campaign hard with subscribers and kicking off long time users without warning. Maybe the right hand doesn’t know what the left is doing

2408 2018-12-15 07:53:30 Well I'll say goodbye to you now then, hope investors pull thier money from your stocks before you go bankrupt in the next year or so.
2409 2018-12-15 07:52:59 There were still stocks left and u pulled that, ain’t no way I was gonna tolerate that level of disrespect
2410 2018-12-15 07:51:57 imagine being two stocks down and the other guy sd’s and you teabag him i don’t understand
2411 2018-12-15 07:51:30 Can't wait for Evan Spiegel to become homeless in 2019 bc of failing and crashing Snap stocks. So his privileged elitist ass can finally experience being poor too for the first time

(in context: he previously said Snapchat is only for and will only focus on rich users)
2412 2018-12-15 07:50:46 “Stocks typ­i­cally rise in De­cem­ber, but this month has proved to be an anom­aly.”

Nope. “Typically rise” is false. “Typically have risen” is true. Past ain’t prologue.

2413 2018-12-15 07:49:44 #Tech stocks, as a group, drove the stock market higher in the first part of 2018, and led the entire market lower this autumn, or so it is frequently said. I’ve lumped tech stocks together this way myself in describing market action recently and as far back as the early 2000s.

2416 2018-12-15 07:47:03 #Cryptocurrencies are subject to many of the same issues as penny stocks. Most of the trading takes place on unregulated platforms overseas. While many call themselves “exchanges
2417 2018-12-15 07:46:34 Penny stocks are cheap, thinly traded and not closely followed by analysts. And as anyone who has seen “The Wolf of Wall Wall Street” knows, they are subject to wild swings and market manipulation by their controlling shareholders
2418 2018-12-15 07:46:04 But any nascent market, like that for HBitcoin, has significant growing pains. The question is whether cryptocurrencies are really just a new form of penny stocks, albeit with a much higher valuation

2443 2018-12-15 07:20:57 Just like those pushing pump and dump stocks on twitter this is in similar vein. Fake story that is perpetually "pumped" on social media by the gulible.

I have long thought that getting stocks to work better in game was a software side issue.  Players needed more options to allow them to adjust the model to their physical reality. Well done!
2455 2018-12-15 07:08:26 Does anyone else notice that Obamacare Subsidies will be shut down at the same time Fed QE is winding down?  Talk about good timing!

You'd think I'd learn.

2458 2018-12-15 07:06:16 fair point but here is the thing one can't gain anything without taking some kind of risk that's always the case. Tumblr took at risk with the NSFW purge and ended up being a total fuck up not only are 90% of their users migrating elsewhere but their stocks took a nose dive.

He never put a fucking dime in stocks, just real estate and small businesses.
2467 2018-12-15 06:51:33 I'm asking, how to value a tokenized stock in a start up, i.e. share in a company with dividends, voting rights etc.  Which I assume would be the same as traditional stocks, but I anticipate tokenized stocks may have additional features traditional stocks never had.

2471 2018-12-15 06:47:35 I have all of these stocks sir. 
2472 2018-12-15 06:47:06 I guess I am not clear on the ?? you are asking? How you will value a security token? or how you value stocks? Of course there are so many books on valuations, but in regards to the valuing a ST, time will tell, but I think it's valued as a security, whether its a token or not

2474 2018-12-15 06:46:36 Your biggest prediction was for treasury yields to go much higher which they haven't. Your bet was that oil, and energy stocks would go higher, which they haven't. I understand that you like to brag, but acknowledging the mistakes would also be nice.

2481 2018-12-15 06:41:21 I will answer...if you are a business man and robbers keep attacking your stocks. Do you lock up your shop or you put strategies that will keep the attack in check while you continue making your sales. That's the point.

2487 2018-12-15 06:36:11 Agree, BUT, the quotation was misquoted (is that part of the game?!). 

It's actually:

"Stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down."

2493 2018-12-15 06:28:01 and for all intents and purposes, holding valuable assets is having wealth. Is a rich person who chooses real estate as the place to concentrate their investments not rich anymore, but an equally rich person who invests in stocks still is?

All the losses were in options though...not in stocks.

2525 2018-12-15 05:45:28 Raging bull cannot think straight. Since we do not yet have capitulation, stocks will not rally. There is more selling to ahead. Plus we still have a Fed bent on destroying the economy, and right behind is donald trump's insane tariffs policy.

2531 2018-12-15 05:41:31 Well again we don't believe since your last bold face lie that you had a reached a deal only China knew nothing about it and stocks tanked and have been tanking ever since. Boy your great at this presidency stuff. A real stable genius,huh.
2532 2018-12-15 05:41:16 The rich just gained but look at stocks we are at where Obama left off close to it at least
2533 2018-12-15 05:40:59 Thank you. Thank you lots! I've kept warning about 401K's , IRA's, pensions and stocks for we peasants, but I've only gotten CRICKETS!
2534 2018-12-15 05:39:53 Not a 90-10 person. I’d rather select stocks myself than buy mutual funds. Maybe over the long term, either way is fine. But if you really needed your money in 2001 or 1987 or 2008, maybe not so good.
2535 2018-12-15 05:39:04 When people discover that Bitcoin is sound money maybe they will give up on stocks/bonds/real estate/ect as a way to beat inflation and just buy Bitcoin.
2536 2018-12-15 05:36:35 We dumped a bunch of stocks yesterday...THANK GOD!!!

2538 2018-12-15 05:34:43 Had people over today, got a lot of practice. Ganon is so insanely good in advantage, he can get in, get two or three hits, and all of a sudden you're offstage and in kill percent. Plus f smash reads can *disintegrate* stocks at crazy percents. Loving this character more each day
2539 2018-12-15 05:33:48 If you change your focus from PRICE to VALUE 
 You will never have to predict the direction of market.
 You will rejoice market declines, as you get the opportunity to buy.
 You will rejoice market inclines, as your stocks reach new heights.

2543 2018-12-15 05:27:44 It’s. Just like trading stocks.. learn how options work and what strike to pick and trade options in stead of equity. If you put in the work and time to learn options it’s not rocket science

2561 2018-12-15 05:12:31 You are talking stocks. Our stock market is down because of chinas market. Their market is down because of growth. Our growth is just fine.
2562 2018-12-15 05:12:23 stocks
2563 2018-12-15 05:12:13 Very well? Debt and deficit spiraling out of control, stocks down, bailing out our farmers from our own tariffs?  Yeah, we're doing great.

2568 2018-12-15 05:06:38 Correct.  Some restrictions to stop tomfoolery but not many AFAIK.  I don't have one open myself and don't live in Canada anymore.

BUT I understand that the IRA or roth something is somewhat similar to them.  Some people put dividend paying stocks into IRAs I think?
2569 2018-12-15 05:05:35 It's the emergency porn vault to open when stocks take a massive drop.
2570 2018-12-15 05:04:33 Very difficult market conditions with most leading stocks under their 200-day moving averages which means cash is my largest position.

2572 2018-12-15 05:04:08 @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump @Senate @Congress Trump Fixed Nothing! Retailers & Factories Closing, Jobs, Mostly Minimum Wages Not A Living Wage! An Entire Year Of Stocks Making Money Is Gone! Infrastructure? Not! Health Care Bigger, Better, Covers Everyone? Not! He Didn't Even Try!
2573 2018-12-15 05:04:06 I can’t teach you stocks in 260 characters. Sorry. 

The “DOW” is a basket of stocks (an index) of the 30 largest companies in the US, and it indicates the cost of those stocks collectively. Investors used it was a metric for how the market is doing.
2574 2018-12-15 05:02:59 It's finally here! Hope stocks won't run out before I can save moeny to buy one!
2575 2018-12-15 05:02:30 I'm not sure what the 401ks and the IRAs do but in Canada we have tax free savings accounts where we pay full tax on a limited contribution ($6k these days), not many rules on what we can put into it.  Stocks or whatever.  Then whatever gains are ours tax free.

2583 2018-12-15 04:56:18 While I share the simplified "Volatility & Fibonacci" sheet with you, know that it is just a tool which works reasonably well in a trending market.
Choose a few stocks and one or two indices; keep your focus on few to keep away distractions. Idea, here, is to take home some money
2584 2018-12-15 04:56:15 The ruling had stated that he was asked to hold the ruling until the OEP ended. Makes no difference  WHOLESALE CONFUSION. How will this affect the plans now? HealthCare stocks will tank come Monday AM
2585 2018-12-15 04:56:09 Price of a stock easily available but real value of a stock takes huge amount of time,number crunching

Price of stocks are decided by emotion while 
Value decided by underlying business

PRICES of stock whole day keep changing
Value of stock takes 3 month minimum time to change

2615 2018-12-15 04:29:18 It doesn’t tell much. Buyouts are rare, and when they occur they are most often unexpected. Big pharma doesn’t use the same metrics for buying companies that we use for buying stocks.

2622 2018-12-15 04:23:44 thats not drawback. What if it could have gone to 1200? Its called momentum investing. Read more about it. It works very well over long term hence many fund managers fall behind index despite having decent stocks.
2623 2018-12-15 04:20:47 To quote @gx22  They have a BAJILLION stocks, they still need to buy more.

- Ban bump stocks

Throw a dart at the above and we’d be better off than “do nothing”
2626 2018-12-15 04:19:02 Any time there's talk of  ACA"s demise (such as tonight) insurance stocks take a beating. Positive news for ACA, ins stocks rise. That's all you need to know. ACA is good for the insurance companies, do you think it's good for the insured?
2627 2018-12-15 04:14:54 In a short space of time,  in 2019 to be specific,  we will have to deal with prospects of potential recession in the US + a slowing China + the end of a 10 year bull market in global stocks! A key question is; will global central banks have enough tools to stimulate growth?
2628 2018-12-15 04:14:45 All day I been looking for more stocks to buy. 
2629 2018-12-15 04:13:52 If you support Affordable Care Act...does it translate into...those without money...shouldn't have insurance  Under ACA isn't a PROFIT still the motivation...nah. most 401k includes medical stocks...that's odd
2630 2018-12-15 04:13:05 Hey, I have to admit I haven’t kept up with the blue chip / retail stocks as of late. Sorry I can’t offer more opinion
2631 2018-12-15 04:11:23 Thanks. I learn something interesting every day. Some older articles say the fuel used for this is/was liquid coal, with development of renewable fuels based on biomass feed stocks (plants). It can reach 60k' & stay aflight for 34+ hours w/o refueling. It reminds me of a whale.
2632 2018-12-15 04:11:22 I think about gun control and bump stocks.
2633 2018-12-15 04:09:48 You are a constitutional disaster. America is in crisis. Children dying in government care. Racism is rampant. Gun deaths were up last year because of lax gun laws. Domestic terrorists are born and bred in USA. Allies retreating. Vets suffering. Stocks falling. It’s a mess
2634 2018-12-15 04:07:00 It’s a start but there’s along way to go & this industry has no right to grow drug-induced Atlantic salmon in beautiful BC . We need to rebuild our WILD stocks & they need to get out of our waters !!!  It’s a good start though . Thank you.
2635 2018-12-15 04:03:29 I recommend the stocks, although pillories seems almost more apt.

Aside: If we learned about stocks as adults, and not as children, would their use take on a different flavor?
2636 2018-12-15 04:02:35 Tax loss selling cannot be that huge. Just another excuse. When there is a US holiday our markets are dead. Our dollar is at 75 cents for a reason and it’s the same reason energy stocks are down. This country is not working. It is politically and economically dysfunctional.
2637 2018-12-15 04:02:24 Found it...

2650 2018-12-15 03:55:04 Ima listen to a couple more tunes and then I’m back to learning more about stocks, ETFs and mutual funds.
2651 2018-12-15 03:55:01 Maybe 1.8 - 2k. But everyone has to be careful. When international stocks crash #bitcoin will surely take a hit too. The ups and downs of the last 10 years were a bull market in a bull market.. Now it's time for bears.
2652 2018-12-15 03:54:30 pls update your views daily on index and stocks after option data builtup around 10
2653 2018-12-15 03:54:17 Half the time I don't realize that someone has the game set to 2 stocks. So, I'm expecting a 3rd stock and the final hit zoom in scares the shit out of me!

2656 2018-12-15 03:48:07 Your request for buying stocks is denied though.
2657 2018-12-15 03:47:58 Stocks are certainly held by a smaller and smaller portion of population. Of course, 401k , pension, ira and the like are in stocks too... Well, as you say... mostly nyet exactly "real" valuations. Largely disconnected from real economy. What's left of it,  anyway.  Sigh.
2658 2018-12-15 03:46:08 We are in beginning stages of really deep bear market. When Fed is raising rates into a slowing global economy you have major issue. Fed should be cutting out economy is cratering towards certain recession. Stocks will drop a lot more next week

2664 2018-12-15 03:41:15 I use similar techniques to traditional stocks.  For example COSS and KCS are crypto exchanges that pay owners of the token a share of profits on a weekly/daily basis so I use P/E ratio for those coins.
2665 2018-12-15 03:40:54 What can’t last? Record low unemployment? Energy independence? Record high stocks? Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula?

2668 2018-12-15 03:38:21 Last month I bought 2 jackets worth of Canada Goose stocks...thanks to this Canada China tension and boycott of Canadian products it's apparent I should have just bought the jackets. Didn't see that coming!
2669 2018-12-15 03:36:42 Markets are never in love with Modi govt. Indian markets underperformed global markets in last 4years drastically. Markets always like Congress govt. Kash itni majority. Kash yeh lvl ka crude ager congress ke paas hota toa market kha se kha hota. #stocks #Nifty
2670 2018-12-15 03:35:15 I disagree. A few of us who know Trump supporters are starting to see the cracks. They may be delusional, ok with racism, etc, but they voted to disrupt the “swampiness” in DC. His money laundering while giving tax cuts & to the rich & tanking stocks isn’t popular at all.

2674 2018-12-15 03:32:08 You may have noticed that index as well as many stocks in small cap segments last few days are opening low and closing high.

This is a clear sign of bull market in small cap and mid cap stock

On or before expiry we can see small cap index above its resistance 6350
2675 2018-12-15 03:31:58 I am not saying the quantity is ALOT, I am just saying it's one factor people should consider & think about. There are plenty of stocks that go down even if the majority does not have a short interest. Statistics show that 90% of people like to bet on higher prices #Bullish 
2676 2018-12-15 03:31:31 They always talk shit about other stocks and manipulate. I really want to hear their analysts rate their company stocks.

Who knows? These crooks might even sell short their own company

-then they will make shitloads of money
-all sitting on huge moat
-best to identify cos with global potential
2695 2018-12-15 03:16:17 Bought only $100 of Ether at $10 (which went to ~$1,300) when I had tons of "dry powder" waiting for stocks to get cheaper. Now we're almost back to $10 lol. I could've had a lambo :(
2696 2018-12-15 03:16:06 Holy shit, that’s awful. Most of mine is munies but a portion of that is always in stocks.

2699 2018-12-15 03:10:54 I changed my mind on energy a few weeks back.  One reason is seeing no institutional support at any valuation.  

This may be because institutions are divesting any stocks associated with climate change.  

That is not worth fighting. Instead will focus Nat gas, solar, nuclear.

2703 2018-12-15 03:09:24 As you mentioned, crypto is still seen as high risk. As long as investors (and mostly speculators) see this, they will liquidate their riskier positions (e.g., digital assets like XRP) first, along with the more volatile stocks and other holdings.

2707 2018-12-15 03:07:19 We shouldn't base our healthcare on the economy. Because depending on jobs and the stocks to pay taxes to Obamacare. Makes Obamacare unstable.
2708 2018-12-15 03:06:50 so do you have a job? do you have a 401 K, do you have a house? do you have children in a good school, do you have any stocks, do you save any money, if you can answer to these questions, you can thank God Hillary isn't President.

2711 2018-12-15 03:05:55 Markets aren't fair, unbiased, and impervious to manipulation. 

So I don't.

Read a story this past week about how either the NYSE or some stock exchange was frontrunning stocks for favored firms.

Totally sickening. Got me livid.

I'll post the link here if I ever find it.

2714 2018-12-15 03:03:59 PB...it’s here where I digress: these people (code for #babyboomers imo) are in the process of securing their wealth {pensions, 401’s, stocks, retirement acct’s, etc} into save haven assets as we speak...these people are a step ahead of the herd...they are selling to the saps now

2716 2018-12-15 03:00:19 Stocks are fine man. I think people are over exaggerating. I didn't even look at the market.
2717 2018-12-15 02:58:48 Play the market or get played by it. The dow is a reflection of 30 stocks. You don't invest in the Dow Jones, but rather individual stocks. But hey, guess the genius claiming to be 50k down knows more than than the guy 10% up this quarter. I'll step up to that truth any day.
2718 2018-12-15 02:58:05 Yet another indicator that central bank tightening and the resulting loss of liquidity is primary driver of markets ... not saying that it IS, but something to watch as Draghi here also wraps up QE. This is sort of the inverse of 2016 (?) when earnings were down, but stocks up.

2729 2018-12-15 02:49:30 It’s a good idea to have a strategy to skim profits and buy property. It forces you to sell your stocks, makes it impossible to be tempted to take another punt, and locks in a nice 10-15 year investment that someone else can pay off.
Stay diverse IMO!!
;D
2730 2018-12-15 02:49:05 Plus the shop stocks gluten-free things, which is more than can be said for the place in Shieldaig!
2731 2018-12-15 02:48:06 No, I have not and can't really comment.  I did buy Mexican airport company PAC - I think the political risk is overstated and cheap now and huge, somewhat regulated, moat.  Plus bought SYPR as a turnaround.  Many Canadian stocks getting very cheap too.
2732 2018-12-15 02:47:26 Yes it is a loss even if you haven't sold.  Where do these ideas come from?  #markets #stocks

2738 2018-12-15 02:43:49 Seems to be affecting Canadian Pot Stocks in the selloff more than the US companies, but maybe that’s just $APHA effect.
2739 2018-12-15 02:43:27 @TRowePrice How does a mutual fund like #PRSCX - Science & Technology manage to lose 27% in one day? What are you people doing with our money? #TRowePrice #stocks #markets #tech

2742 2018-12-15 02:42:32 Yeah, the T. Rowe Price PRSCX - Science & Technology managed to lose 27% in one day today. So, stocks and even mutual funds have become dangerous to invest in. Better luck with your next attempt at reasoning.

2752 2018-12-15 02:33:59 I decided to play Super Smash Brothers Ultimate but the default was 3 stocks - 2:30 so when I remove the time limit, I thought the stocks were already set to three.

2755 2018-12-15 02:32:45 Trade war vs China ill-timed following creation of fiscal deficits; as China will have less dollars to recycle into US Treasuries necessitating increased interest rates. Mkt expecting inevitable borrowing cost rise to slow economy.  Stocks less attractive vs bonds.

You have missed out on so many good shorts within the last year, that it is just incomprehensible!
2762 2018-12-15 02:23:47 And if you're a small shop you can't take a risk giving shelf space to these titles.  Even here, in LA, a good shop that stocks a LOT of indies, doesn't do that many past issue 1 or 2.  And I don't blame the shops AT. ALL.  They can't stock what they can't sell.
2763 2018-12-15 02:22:37 All stocks are down anyway.

2781 2018-12-15 02:01:38 If you invested into $MCD last year you wouldn't even be 100% today. 

The company is too large to double in stock value over that short amount of time.

So if you want to double your money those are not the stocks. Get into low/mid-cap stocks or crypto.

2803 2018-12-15 01:36:38 Tulips/bulb bubble was in the 1600’s... is there a commodity market still where they are traded? In  US stocks, it was 21 months... ‘73-‘74... was in a larger secular bear that lasted 16 years.
2804 2018-12-15 01:34:41 Why tf are your senators allowed to buy stocks like that? Isn’t that a huge conflict of interest regardless of the stocks?

2812 2018-12-15 01:25:28 To find out the value of a company multiply the stock price by the number of stocks outstanding. This will give you the market capitalization, which is the market value of the firm. However, since they can buy back their own stock, the value is artificially inflated.

2816 2018-12-15 01:22:39 We continue to be modestly short stocks and we will hedge for the possibility of a dovish Fed with Dollar shorts. We have real doubts about whether stocks can muster more than a tepid bounce regardless of what the Fed does but we certainly respect the potential for a squeeze.
2817 2018-12-15 01:22:39 CCO charts and price action are used by Market Makers to drag bullish retail in to U Stocks, it is a contrarian indicator. U bull market is still quite far IMHO.
2818 2018-12-15 01:22:20 Bump stocks are arguably not fit for the purpose they were designed. They do not allow a weapon to function accurately. Congress should have banned them. The Executive Order banning them can and should be overturned.
2819 2018-12-15 01:22:07 Needed to do that in January when Ray Dalio said you will look stupid being in cash.   First year since 1994 that t-bills beat both stocks and bonds.

2826 2018-12-15 01:09:52 ETF’s do in-kind redemptions so when the ETF trades at a discount on the exchange, Authorized Purchasers (banks) buy the shares, redeem in-kind, and then sell the stocks (or bonds) that are delivered to them....so ETF’s have redemptions covered.
2827 2018-12-15 01:09:30 I just hear someone say 75% of stocks are below the 200DMA. 

Don’t let the over/under 2600 dominate your mind.

2846 2018-12-15 00:50:00 SIPC has said they won't cover these accounts because it is not the kind of insurance they provide.

2911 2018-12-14 23:55:01 Keeping trades small and going for any green you can find is the most important that I have learned from @EyeoftheStormZ after blowing up an entire account this past summer/fall when the casino stocks cratered. Better to chip away at the losses than chase a home run trade.
2912 2018-12-14 23:53:49 And, there's a big difference between nominal and real gains. If the fed does negative rates, it could take a 20% drop in the dollar just to push stocks back up 20%
2913 2018-12-14 23:53:30 They pay wages with sales you moron, you think they're paying wages by borrowing??  I don't think you understand how business works, if you aren't generating the revenue to cover expenses you go out of business, it has nothing to do with borrowing or stocks.

2916 2018-12-14 23:53:00 I do not think full auto firearms should be generally available nor things that simulate full auto fire like bump stocks.

Full auto and bump stocks do not serve a defensive purpose and require training to be used in a safe manner.

2918 2018-12-14 23:51:15 Where are they getting the money to pay these higher wages? When they raise wages the stock price will fall, stocks are assets if you borrow against assets and the price falls then you have to pay more collateral

2928 2018-12-14 23:57:05 @JNJNews I am glad your stocks are dropping you should be ashamed!  Someday you will have to answer for putting money over humanity. Remember you can’t take it with you!

2948 2018-12-14 23:37:10 Man with the 500% rally in Bitcoin and the 10% rally in stocks it’s gonna be a big 2 weeks.
2949 2018-12-14 23:35:26 First of all, I never said that. Second of all, only whoosies play 10 stocks
2950 2018-12-14 23:34:23 10 stocks?  I guess you wanna play with items and time too manny?
2951 2018-12-14 23:33:55 Successful trading is not just about transacting in stocks but being disciplined, controlling your greed and fear and most importantly being emotionally detached to your trades. in short not everyone's cuppa tea.
2952 2018-12-14 23:33:50 im glad k rool's fsmash kills at 60 in the middle of the stage

thanks for having 2 stocks like a cuck btw
2953 2018-12-14 23:33:30 Lmao when someone says 10 stocks final destination you know you might as well just not play with their elementary asses
2954 2018-12-14 23:33:26 Exactly. If they aren't put in stocks so that we can all at least throw rotten tomatoes at them, why bother?
2955 2018-12-14 23:32:57 Hey Mulvaney, stocks suck

2958 2018-12-14 23:32:08 Always the problem. Human nature. Impatience. 

Small investors I know buy the crap stocks in a sector. 
Not the best of breed they should.
2959 2018-12-14 23:31:47 Right? Like, oh I’m so sorry their stocks fell. Now how about a bigger payout to the affected families?
2960 2018-12-14 23:31:44 I think the most frustrating thing is getting 1v1 but it’s 2 stocks
2961 2018-12-14 23:31:39 I’ll double it. $200. 3 stocks. Sector Z.
2962 2018-12-14 23:29:48 joke: Johnson & Johnson stocks dip

woke: Johnson & Johnson executives charged with murder
2963 2018-12-14 23:29:42 Can we skip that ma'am and go classic with stocks instead?
2964 2018-12-14 23:28:58 And the debt? You do realize that people buy and sell stocks during different times right? So unless you bought your stocks on day 1 of the presidency, which I would doubt, you are not doing so great right now. Sep-Dec -16%
2965 2018-12-14 23:27:38 Hoy la tasa real es positiva considerablemente. Me parece que la tasa no la bajan porque le tienen respeto a los stocks “volatiles”
2966 2018-12-14 23:25:06 Bring back the stocks and just leave them there. Absolute scum.
2967 2018-12-14 23:24:36 Stocks down 500 today.  Not cool.
2968 2018-12-14 23:22:42 All the power, I’m invested in C. I’m not selling, but anyone have an idea on stocks for Monday. I’ll lose if it goes down, that’s ok,  because I’ll double down on a drop.. so will it go up? Or down? Survey says........
2969 2018-12-14 23:20:11 yikes,,, i just remember once twt having a crisis over the stocks dropping and saying we’re about to lose twice
2970 2018-12-14 23:18:49 Dude, stop drinking the Kool-aid.  Stocks are falling like rocks and NOT up 25%. Be a better American and don't lie like #Trump does.
2971 2018-12-14 23:18:33 With bio stocks as low as they are today, the 2019 contest (provided you continue with it) will be interesting
2972 2018-12-14 23:16:32 $SPY Most want stocks/markets go higher before buying stocks and then when it goes higher they'll want it lower.
2973 2018-12-14 23:16:03 Are you giving cash gifts to someone on your list this Christmas season? Pick up a Visa gift card instead—it can be used anywhere Visa is accepted, and there is NO ACTIVATION FEE! The Scrip Office stocks $50, $100, and $250 denominations.
2974 2018-12-14 23:15:16 Has the U.S. ever had a 'mainstream media' allowed to support a 'coup' against a U.S. President- now going after the stock market, for months.   Aren't FAKE 'media' propaganda AND current Fed policy proving what needs to take place for stocks to resume their upward trend?
2975 2018-12-14 23:15:08 everytime i see the words cult man on the tl i have war flashbacks to jype’s stocks dropping
2976 2018-12-14 23:14:51 Yep still a ways to go before institutional investors run out of stocks they can dump for a profit
2977 2018-12-14 23:14:21 I watch stocks a lot. Not because I have any stock but because I enjoy seeing rich people lose a lot of money. It's also hilarious how inaccurate all the predictions are.
2978 2018-12-14 23:13:07 WHAT no tweet about Stocks lately ?? YOU ARE A DISASTER IN BUSINESS, for the life of me i dont understand how you managed to CON Stupid America ?? Exactly what is it that you've done for American Tax Paying Families who are going to get hit with higher taxes ?

2980 2018-12-14 23:11:57 Checked my stocks and I’ve lost almost $4000 since the beginning of the year...that may not be a lot to some ppl, but it’s a HUGE loss for someone like me...a non-1%er average struggling American
2981 2018-12-14 23:11:08 Pharmaceutical companies stocks will continue to grow in length and breadth. Aside, transportation, retail stocks expected to slow down. Technology stocks Google, Microsoft, Honeywell, Medtronics, Boeing will continue to grow slowly but surely.
2982 2018-12-14 23:07:57 Nigga the money they spend on pointless ass shit they could build a fucking company from the ground up invest in ode stocks not even worrying if they get it back cus they gon blow it anyway like nigga wtf 
2983 2018-12-14 23:07:21 Stocks are tanking

You Hall of mirrors is collapsing
2984 2018-12-14 23:06:49 @realDonaldTrump
Stocks typically rise in December. But, thanks to Trump and his tariffs, all three major U.S. stock indexes are down 5.5% or more, their worst starts to December since 1980.  #DonaldFailing
2985 2018-12-14 23:06:17 Pulse fishing is decimating fish stocks most remoaners know very little about Brexit
2986 2018-12-14 23:05:51 Last 2 weeks of the year have lots of risk for bond bulls.

Stocks keep sliding and bonds go nowhere? 

Mom and pop may start dumping their bonds too!
2987 2018-12-14 23:05:44 J Rees-Mogg but more than a dick. He is vile. Can we bring back the stocks??? We could charge £1 a throw and make a lot of money for charity. @TheLastLeg #moggdick
2988 2018-12-14 23:05:34 Cramer acting all serious/somber at opening of his show.   Saying it's too early to do anything but stock pick on the way down.   "At this pace we will not have long to go before stocks are too cheap to ignore."   He's still calling it a bear market and blaming Uncle Jay.
2989 2018-12-14 23:05:13 Will hotbox with Stocks before the dance. 

Anyone going to the dance, all meet up at the nearest pizzeria for the late-nite after party.
2990 2018-12-14 23:05:08 Plus the eu allow pulse fishing which decimates fish stocks so you’re talking crap
2991 2018-12-14 23:03:07 Hell's stocks are underperforming 
2992 2018-12-14 23:02:15 #trade Small-cap S&P 600 index confirms bear market

As U.S. stocks have been rocked by trade tensions and monetary policy worries, shares of small-cap companies, by one measure, have now confirmed that they are in their first bear market in three years. A drop of 20 percent…
2993 2018-12-14 23:01:50 Is that just another one of your lies just like the middle class tax cut and ban on Bump Stocks???
2994 2018-12-14 23:01:21 You might have to go to Dads for dinner. His Weed stocks outperformed the S&P
2995 2018-12-14 23:00:48 such a tough tape to trade this week, whipsawed the hell out of my P&L and ended up scratch for this week, going to focus on stocks next week that have context related moves
2996 2018-12-14 23:00:39 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.  私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１
2997 2018-12-14 23:00:35 Brexit has sent the UK back to feudal times where lords could abuse their subjects. Give it another 10 years and we will be put in stocks or evicted for not pay them tax. Time the media took a stand an helped to end to a system that has no place in a modern democracy!
2998 2018-12-14 22:59:31 I have been in the market for a long time, and yes that is how the market  is suppose to work with up and down swings, but never have I ever seen the market in a constant downward spiral.  Stocks currently are less than what they were 2 years ago.
2999 2018-12-14 22:59:19 Just 20 years ago, it was impossible to bank online, shop online, check your balance online, apply for credit or loans online or trade stocks online! And it was considered a huge security risk.
3000 2018-12-14 22:58:11 my tl was nothing but housamo underwears and no one got them because they sold out so instantly. The only stocks they have is small on the moritaka one but I CANT FIT IN THAT

3003 2018-12-14 22:56:52 ftilt kills, fireballs are like free stocks sometimes, fsmash has insane knockback and its pretty safe and easy to hit it
3004 2018-12-14 22:56:13 Yep, and when companies like J&J are found to have been covering up toxins in their BABY POWDER, yes, stocks are going to tumble, as they should! Plus to me, this is a minor correction and nothing to lose sleep over.
3005 2018-12-14 22:54:00 Update. Comes on r33 wheels and have stocks too
3006 2018-12-14 22:53:44 i don't know where you get your info but stocks were down !!! let's blame Obama
3007 2018-12-14 22:52:34 Micah @pjraitt  is the real deal old school trader like myself we have been trading longer than you been alive when we had No computers much different times I respect what you do with those penny stocks but we seldom touch anything under 100 bucks.

3011 2018-12-14 22:50:01 I sold most of my stocks about 6 weeks ago which turned out to be a pretty good choice.

My diversification is cash, crypto and really good education.

No investment advice.
3012 2018-12-14 22:49:21 Agreed. I honestly cant stand people like this. Obviously has way too much time on his hands, and would rather complain than try an do something to change his and/or the stocks situation. #tigerhempbeer #letsdothis #5iiiiiiiiiive #grindtilidie
3013 2018-12-14 22:47:47 I disagree with the bump stock ban on principle but bump stocks are useless to hunters, marksmen or those who keep weapons for home defense.  They are a useless novelty. Trump was wrong on their ban by Executive Order but he is a greater friend to 2A than any Dem .

3021 2018-12-14 22:43:30 Dear lord. The stocks are too good for him.
3022 2018-12-14 22:43:11 STOCKS: Continue to sell rallies? 
Stock negatives include: 1) wealth index  
2) weak investor confidence (VIX) 
3) negative trend 
4) geopolitical tension. 
Positives are: 
1) stocks are near key support
2) oversold 
3) fed may back off interest rate hikes 
4) Christmas rally???
3023 2018-12-14 22:43:08 If you could only trade stocks in this  type of market it would be very difficult because it's so costly and and cumbersome to short stocks
3024 2018-12-14 22:42:56 Nobody could figure out why west side highway and the elevated "sine" part of the part sticking out and rolling huge boulders near the stocks exchange had Jersey now contemplating death by suffocation and yet the truth was there and it meant what everybody else had thought and
3025 2018-12-14 22:42:38 Of course there is no proof.  These fellows aren't billionaires because they are stupid or aren't internet savvy (or have help with that).  I'm willing to bet Soros has shorted Can stocks since JT assumed power.  That is what he does for jollies.
3026 2018-12-14 22:41:12 Yea i know... Trump pumped with another tweet and the market reacted with a sell off on all the S&P 500 stocks. This is why I’m staying away of options right now! The greed is sooo easy to feel and cause you mistakes! Congrats if you can control it in a daily basis... not me
3027 2018-12-14 22:40:31 everyone should just use my strategy from the mock stock trading game in high school economics: find the most obscure stocks possible, buy them, and trade them two days later when you find funnier and more obscure stocks
3028 2018-12-14 22:40:14 Based on headlines alone, the contrarian would...

1) Buy bitcoin
2) Short marijuana stocks
3) Stop reading the headlines
3029 2018-12-14 22:39:38 Check me if I'm wrong but as far as E-trade is concerned I see no insider trading in the peak area of this stocks run...or anywhere for that matter except at the beginning of the run.  Doesn't the term dump...in a pump and dump require a dump...somewhere? $NHPI  Just saying.
3030 2018-12-14 22:39:33 Notice how no one on social media is making a huge deal about bump stocks anymore. Did I call it, or did I call it? 
3031 2018-12-14 22:39:27 Take some Quaaludes, sleep, take some Quaaludes, sell some Penny stocks, take some Quaaludes, form your own Boiler room brokerage firm, take some Quaaludes, don't sleep, smash your Lambo, take some Quaaludes, get charged with securities fraud, take some Quaaludes,  /p1
3032 2018-12-14 22:39:02 What utter nonsense.  Most people’s 401’s are invested in stocks. Consumer confidence is high with most people spending more this year because they have more $$.  Your statement is pure BS.
3033 2018-12-14 22:38:36 Squirtle is for combos and playing rushdown, Ivysaur is for playing patient and for finishing off stocks, and Charizard is mostly for recovery for me
3034 2018-12-14 22:38:29 This. & the dudes deadass have the weirdest settings. It’ll be like 3 stocks 2 minutes and then they’ll just play time lmao
3035 2018-12-14 22:37:49 Where in the hell is the ban on Bump Stocks?  Let’s start with something easy like Bump Stocks and other alike devices and we will gain momentum from there if you Americans care about the American children and other groups who are grieving!
3036 2018-12-14 22:37:17 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Jim. Boo-yaa.  Just have been wondering why so much attention is given to stocks that go through the death cross, but haven’t heard anything about the Russel 2000, madcap s&p 400, s&p 500 , and Nasdaq 100 making the same move.
3037 2018-12-14 22:35:32 Nice! I just bought some oil stocks today
3038 2018-12-14 22:34:07 Penny stocks (stocks trading at less than $5 per share) are a risky, but with some research potentially huge returning investment.

3045 2018-12-14 22:32:47 The markets reacts mainly to trump news. Godd economy bad trump news leads to plunge in stocks. Bcos of the peri trump flips the trump news seems bad though not bad and the stocks are down. When the Trump news brightens then the stocks will soar again. This is my observation.
3046 2018-12-14 22:31:13 You offer recurrent fair criticism of crypto, which IMO is very valuable. Was not aware you were into cannabis stocks (or is it just cannabis?)

3058 2018-12-14 22:23:56 If you are invested in U.S. stocks, of course the value of this investment is lessened when the market drops. Your net worth is decreased so people can rightly say they lost money, even though it’s a paper loss not confirmed unless you sell your investment.

3060 2018-12-14 22:22:58 YOU should not do a shutdown. The #stockmarket downturn has put more than half of S&P 500 stocks in a bear market, which means they are down more than 20 percent off their recent respective highs, and has put the index on track for its worst quarter since 2011.

3097 2018-12-14 22:06:13 Tom Lee @fundstrat about to be on @CNBC talking about stocks going up 10% in the next two weeks. He's also been calling for #Bitcoin $20,000 all yr.  

I like Tom, he appears smart, obviously too bullish this year. Maybe #StockMarket goes up near term, it's still way overpriced!
3098 2018-12-14 22:05:22 I think you are wrong...but I might have misheard the promo. We'll find out soon enough.  But a prediction that stocks can rally 10% into the end of the year would be equally interesting.  Can't wait to hear his rationale for him being right and the financial markets being wrong.
3099 2018-12-14 22:05:06 Most Stocks sell a dream to soft Fiat holders, those dreams cannot be enforced, new people come in, the dream dies.  It's soft money so we'll get some more, we can hide behind our fences & hell these days don't even have to pay a dividend, then they fail.

3170 2018-12-14 21:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3171 2018-12-14 21:39:51 It should also be mentioned that the richest 10% of americans own 84% of the value of stocks. So yes, while perhaps 50%ish of americans 'own' stocks, the value goes to the wealthy for the most part. Ergo, wealthy getting spanked.

3175 2018-12-14 21:37:44 If I remember ma history we have always been an exporter of fish more than an eater of it , the clyde herring industry for example played it oot - and another reason why the EU is good for protecting stocks, its not like fisherman have to think about a sowing season.

3178 2018-12-14 21:37:09 Stocks go up and down..didn’t you know that Wall Street thinks they can control the country.

3180 2018-12-14 21:36:52 Hi chart guy, I'm 1/2 stocks and 1/2 cash. I started to buy from yesterday. Why do you think we are gonna have santa rally? Most major indices have a bearish formation.
3181 2018-12-14 21:36:05 I would still rather own stocks vs gold.
3182 2018-12-14 21:35:41 I’ve been demoted junior stock looker. I am so sad. at least I still have my stocks
3183 2018-12-14 21:34:34 I should’ve sold my stocks back in October. 
3184 2018-12-14 21:34:20 Stocks slide on fears of global slowdown; Dow drops 495 points.  Stocks on Wall Street took another hit today as data pointing to slowing growth in China renewed concerns of a global economic slowdown. The Dow Jones industrial average pulled back about 2%, or about 495 points.
3185 2018-12-14 21:33:03 Oh I didn’t buy. I’ve followed a simple rule. When the news is telling you about it, it’s already too late. I also know that this market the same as the stocks are volatile and they won’t just keep moving in one direction.
3186 2018-12-14 21:32:55 Excellent day - and week - for Watch List stocks. Dec 2018 profits so far have already exceeded those for whole of Dec 2017.  Added bonus of whales securing .0003s on $IJJP which will come in handy during runs in 2019 as multiple catalysts play out.

3189 2018-12-14 21:31:29 At the moment I only have to make that call on one stock Algonquin Power & Utilities. I don’t have enough shares of the other stocks to drip.
3190 2018-12-14 21:31:16 These people need to be outed and arrested.  I’m for bringing back the public stocks.  A 30-day sentence might make them think twice about pulling a stunt like that.
3191 2018-12-14 21:31:14 Seems large # of investment & fund companies drank their own "punch" & forgot it was only to convince others of spun tale. Over years & months, they believed their own stories & forgot it was all a farce. Their brains soaked in "punch", they were/R blind to overpriced stocks. IMO
3192 2018-12-14 21:30:54 There are actually several new social media platforms out there right now... and with Twitter stocks  dropping every day, I only hope our President will move to one of these platforms b/c that is when I will move as well 
3193 2018-12-14 21:30:36 A wise man, in fact I think Warren Buffet once said...

 Stocks go up more than they go down, but they go down faster than they go up.

3195 2018-12-14 21:28:34 It seems so far away still! So much pain before we go to that stage, I’m so very ready *stocks on tissues* :’D
3196 2018-12-14 21:27:13 they are embarrassing to watch....it's like watching 4th graders trade stocks putting more credence to hourly whispers than being actual experts in the field.  "oh now, there is a tweet....sell, sell. Oh, it was retracted, buy, buy." silly!
3197 2018-12-14 21:27:10 And what would I recommend is to start with simple designs to understand the construction and the flow patterns of them. That way , in the future. You'll have an idea of where to place the stocks and not stock spam completely the icon.

3199 2018-12-14 21:26:26 AP: Stocks ended the week with a steep loss on Wall Street as the S&P 500 dropped to its lowest level since April. The benchmark index is now down almost 3 percent for the year.

3202 2018-12-14 21:26:09 Nothing. Sanctions. Why do you think stocks plummeted. Bad news.
3203 2018-12-14 21:26:03 I think some funds were forced to liquidate once it went under $5 as some can't hold stock under that price as per memorandum. Also some brokers don't provide margin for stocks under $5, so may have been a margin call.

3218 2018-12-14 21:18:15 The same with his followers.  They now simply say "The economy..." .  No more mention of stocks and jobs because with Trump willing to close the government to 400k+ employees there isn't too much to say.  And 14k for GM is not even close to 400K in the gov

3315 2018-12-14 21:17:18 World stocks fall sharply: US -1.9%; Europe -.6%. Fear of an economic slowdown, China trade fears & political dysfunction caused US panic. Markets hate uncertainty & it abounds. Still, base case fundamentals positive. Markets in correction phase & bargain hunters should appear.

3333 2018-12-14 21:10:42 Stocks. 
It's all about inflating the share price. 
Look at the amount of shares these CEOs and stuff hold in their own companies. 
Evaluations all based off young plants with no flowers etc. 
It was a sham show from the beginning.
3334 2018-12-14 21:10:29 The network should have focused on the facts of the retail report VS retail stocks that are way down based on panic ... the REPORT ARE POSITIVE FACTS!!
3335 2018-12-14 21:10:26 "The fact that a company has met all your fundamental criteria does not mean that you should necessarily run out and buy it right away.

A key to making money in stocks is to align supporting fundamentals with constructive price action during healthy overall market environment."

3344 2018-12-14 21:07:19 Just shut up what are you talking about,  he said nothing about stocks
3345 2018-12-14 21:06:54 By now you should have already sold your stocks and only be holding your businesses.
3346 2018-12-14 21:06:40 @CNBCClosingBell Some might say it's a bad day in stocks.  Some may say it's a good day in stocks.  If you saved your cash up. As Warren Buffet once said "When people panic, don't take out your thimble to catch all the gold, but take out your bucket."
3347 2018-12-14 21:06:38 I agree with you, also the huge bump Nintendo stocks got after bowsette, that they didn't have any participation on its creation, sure gotta count too

3352 2018-12-14 21:05:23 Stocks are absolutely worthless. They are paper wealth. At the end of the day he who holds the most paper loses. You need more to address the problem that stocks are entirely valued in secret by trades conducted in dark pools. They can boom or bust the markets at will.
3353 2018-12-14 21:05:16 @AppleSupport your stocks app is very weak it does not have details on fundamentals, u can’t move stocks, please add more functionalities ASAP

3355 2018-12-14 21:03:57 #1 The Dow Jones is set to close down @530 points...again. So Although we the hodlers are currently hurting we are far better off than those who are holding stocks, etf's etc. At some point as the legacy financial markets fully meltdown due to +50 years of financial engineering.
3356 2018-12-14 21:03:45 Stocks Market close the lowest since May from CNBC and your tweeting about Netflix .

3359 2018-12-14 21:02:57 Yes. But not good if you are holding bank stocks already.
3360 2018-12-14 21:02:12 Are you kidding talking about Netflix today when stocks like J&J and Costco got slammed.  Netflix damnage was done along time ago .

3363 2018-12-14 21:01:12 Great time to buy their stocks
3364 2018-12-14 21:00:59 Well, there's a reason it's being done like this. 
The LPs can't supply anything. 
East coast provinces are hardly even getting half their stock orders. 
That's what happens when you say you can grow tonnes of cannabis and don't employ people actually capable of it
Stocks tho

Be The Judge!

Peter Obi (PDP)  You can't close down shop to chase criminals.

Yemi Osibanjo (APC) If you allow criminals to steal all stocks, there would be no shop. 

What is that shop and who was are the criminals both of them were referring to???
3368 2018-12-14 21:00:14 Watched your video on wealth daily this morning.  I'm struggling w/ no investments or savings.  Trying to learn & was thinking of penny stocks. If I pay the $29 for your special on those reports 2day, are there things in there that can help someone like me prepare for a crash?
3369 2018-12-14 21:00:14 Crude investor shouldn't be buying above $VIX 20. Bloomberg stocks pimps
3370 2018-12-14 20:59:58 A lot of tech stocks have Dot Com charts to them.
3371 2018-12-14 20:59:12 They can't wait that long, don't think market will accept it
3372 2018-12-14 20:59:06 Seems natural to me; after all during 2012-16 period when economic & earnings growth was weak, stocks rallied hard ie we had PE multiple expansion; now its opposite
3373 2018-12-14 20:58:21 Stock market the worst since 2008.  Thank you  Donald Trump. A new  Republican President and a new Recession #stocks #recession2020 #RepublicanParty @SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP @GOP #tariffs
3374 2018-12-14 20:58:12 its clear they are guilty of the deceit part its how they decide to respond

3378 2018-12-14 20:57:11 Once I saw a man put milk in his cup before the tea bag. Rightfully, they put him in the stocks for a week. Pervert.
3379 2018-12-14 20:56:36 No smart people would be buying stocks to hold over this weekend with all the bad news, and Fed hike next week
3380 2018-12-14 20:56:19 I'm sure they did their review before buying them... why do you need internal review to show it to us...
Unless..............
3381 2018-12-14 20:55:18 okkkk. could u make it stocks please
3382 2018-12-14 20:54:43 internal reviews can take months

3384 2018-12-14 20:54:25 china stocks not moving that harshly downwards. good sign i guess. i dislike trump but betting on his impeachment is silly. gop has to revolt to impeach him.
3385 2018-12-14 20:53:59 he put me in the stocks cause i was tweeting too much :(
3386 2018-12-14 20:53:40 Another rough day for FAANG stocks. $AAPL and $GOOGL now in the red for the year along with $FB. $AMZN and $NFLX still up a sizable amount but are well off their highs.

3390 2018-12-14 20:52:37 Nice relative strength in MCD. It's going  while other stocks go 
3391 2018-12-14 20:52:00 I don't know how this will turn out, but when I look at my portfolios I take comfort that the quality of companies and baskets of stocks that I own will eventually bear fruit in increased value. May take some time but quality investments usually find their way to the top.
3392 2018-12-14 20:51:45 Very odd day - gold down, bonds flat, vix up < 10%. All the action is in stocks getting drubbed - no panic - volume pretty light
3393 2018-12-14 20:51:06 What are stocks like please?
3394 2018-12-14 20:50:58 (Stop it.)

3395 2018-12-14 20:50:45 How many stocks do you think the average Trump voter owns?
3396 2018-12-14 20:50:29 Trade your #strategy not your #stocks.
3397 2018-12-14 20:50:20 les stocks de lacrymo sont épuisés aussi
3398 2018-12-14 20:50:16 I would highly recommend it! The prices are really cheap, and as tech stocks continue to falter, big money will start to flow into pot stocks. That’s what my second installment will be on. Just the perfect position Pot stocks are in, as long as you understand the risks 
3399 2018-12-14 20:50:14 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reporting 39 billion worth of global equity has been removed this week, 28 billion of which has been removed from US Stocks. Are we tired of winning yet? #GOP #tariffs #TradeWar #AreWeGreatYet
3400 2018-12-14 20:49:35 @JeffBezos Why are your executives selling the stocks while your investors keep losing their hard earned money? College funds and 401 K being demolished. Are we your bag holders? First we spend thousands on your site and then get a kick in the groin for doing so ! Shameful!!!
3401 2018-12-14 20:49:32 FUT investors* 
They LOVE actual EA investors. 
To the point of destroying their Flagship Series, FIFA.
But that gravy train seems like its about to die when you look at the depreciation of their stocks over the last 6 months.
3402 2018-12-14 20:47:09 I'm a Cubs fan but what does a disservice is a tax cut that allows corporations to buy back their stocks at a lower price unions are the problem give me a break!
3403 2018-12-14 20:46:56 US steel stocks fell because ofvthectrade war. Soybean farmers have to sell to Canada for a lot less because China is not buying them.
3404 2018-12-14 20:46:35 @realDonaldTrump Stocks could struggle after record outflows, history shows
Data compiled by the Lipper team at Refinitiv showed investors pulled $46.2 billion from U.S. equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds between Dec. 5 and Dec. 12.
3405 2018-12-14 20:46:19 Hi mark did u hear back from your publisher
3406 2018-12-14 20:46:16 Also, I have diversified my pf a great deal, now invested in the wider capital markets. Stocks/bonds/commodities. Crypto is like 10% of total allocation. And mostly automatically managed
3407 2018-12-14 20:45:24 Neither, really. Stocks fall whenever Jupiter and Saturn aren’t aligned properly. This is a well known fact.
3408 2018-12-14 20:45:09 Yeah, get out of stocks except maybe the S&P500 index...
3409 2018-12-14 20:45:08 Looking for a stylish solution for your porch or driveway plants?

We have just launched our garden container SALE with up to 50% off selected lines whilst stocks last!
3410 2018-12-14 20:45:02 If the market doubled in the last 5 years and you held 50% of your wealth in stocks 5 years ago, obviously the share of equity in your portfolio is now 66%, without you buying or selling in the last 5 years. Thus he first chart is essentially S&P graph scaled.
3411 2018-12-14 20:44:07 If you told me that stocks like $MDB, $AYX or $ZS wont do a thing in such conditions, actually rise against the market, I wouldnt believe you lol
3412 2018-12-14 20:43:38 Starting to wonder if trade war deal means China stocks explode while US stocks head lower
3413 2018-12-14 20:43:18 Apple loses more than 3% and Amazon more than 4% - FANG stocks crash again and into a bear market
3414 2018-12-14 20:42:21 Des miliers viennent des stocks irakiens
3415 2018-12-14 20:42:02 You are so full off shit...so its just a coincidence after blizzcon up until now Activision and blizzard stocks droopped since september fron 83$ a piece to 47$? How much is that 4.6 billion$. Month after that they kill the least profitable game?
3416 2018-12-14 20:41:33 US Steel stocks falling because trade war. US Soybeans are zero to China losing at least hundreds of millions of dollars. Yea. Trump trade war hurt our economy not help it
3417 2018-12-14 20:41:25 Only kids get presents this year. Holiday cancelled. Stocks too low to sell.
3418 2018-12-14 20:40:43 everyone complaining about stocks should just enjoy the rally in bonds
3419 2018-12-14 20:40:03 are you trying to say the Darksides conspiracy buddies dont know how to pick stocks?

If you're out there, I love you and you're great. Want to exchange more spikes, preset quotes, and homie stocks
3422 2018-12-14 20:39:21 I'm so happy this game is 3 stocks. Gives much more breathing room to pull off a comeback without relying on rage as much since that also got nerfed.
3423 2018-12-14 20:39:03 "i invested in weed stocks in canada and..... i had no idea it was gonna be this good." i love this healthcare bitch
3424 2018-12-14 20:38:32 .@jamieoliver finally have a guest that doesn't eat meat and every dish is based on FISH! Why not why not use this as a chance to explore other alternatives? Fish stocks are depleting rapidly and you couldn't even cater to veggies/vegans for one week 
3425 2018-12-14 20:38:21 I also think this game should be 3 stocks 8 minutes or 2 stock, 6 minutes. It can be pretty fast but pretty campy so the ruleset needs to cover both playstyles
3426 2018-12-14 20:38:19 STOCKS;  tariffs, trade wars, geo-political problems from a divided     international community caused by trump's attacks resulted in a  global    decline in world wealth:

3429 2018-12-14 20:36:58 Stocks resume slide. Remember, losses only count when you sell. So don't  sell. If you're a long term investor who has a professionally managed, broadly diversified portfolio, don't sell.
3430 2018-12-14 20:36:30 My favorite stocks to short as a hedge against a complete market meltdown in the coming months... $SBUX $MSFT and, of course, $TSLA soon to be $TSLAQ when its lifeblood of formerly abundant, cheap capital becomes rather scarce and pricey. #Bearish
3431 2018-12-14 20:36:28 @jimcramer thanks for all you do for the individual investor!  So, last Dec. it seemed liked most people had a favorable outlook for stocks in 2018 and it hasn’t worked out so well.  Now, the majority seems to think 2019 will be a struggle.  Maybe, just maybe, wrong again?
3432 2018-12-14 20:36:16 @joerogan do you invest in marijuana. If so what stocks do you use?

3434 2018-12-14 20:34:22 The average PE of the small cap index is ridiculous. (41X)  This index needs to decline another 30/40%. If you look at the SP500, take out some stocks that are over loved, valuation is pretty good.

3446 2018-12-14 20:30:03 It’s okay that my checkings and savings from Robinhood wont be protected. I’m well diversified with pot stocks, crypto, and shares of moviepass if they somehow can’t make 3% in a bear market
3447 2018-12-14 20:29:58 $FB, $AMZN, $AAPL, $TSLA You don't have to do any trade everyday. Wait all day for your favorite stocks. Buy if you feel it for good price. I just did only 14 trades all week and made $1900. Better than loosing $$$$ Have a great weekend.

3450 2018-12-14 20:29:05 If your theory is "stocks are moving based on their charts and perceived defensiveness rather than based on fundamentals" you could do worse than to point to $PG making new highs at 22x earnings.
3451 2018-12-14 20:28:54 I have used Robinhood for my small amounts of individual stocks.  I signed up for the checking account.  I'm a little wary, because of the lack of FDIC/NCUA insurance, but I usually only keep about $10k in checking/savings so I'm willing to take that risk.

3485 2018-12-14 20:12:58 In a true "risk off" event every market in the world gets affected. But you need to think it out as you said. It depends where the particular market is positioned. BTC is already close to its bottom and a "long accumulation TR" would make sense if stocks correct now.

3564 2018-12-14 19:42:40 Finally investors are showing some fear and pessimism. Sentiment is most bearish since 2013. Great news! We can make a bottom in stocks now.
3565 2018-12-14 19:42:29 CTA trend following needs to move out of the "alternative" and into the mainstream. Real crisis alpha is using a trend following strategy on the entire portfolio, especially stocks.

3567 2018-12-14 19:41:34 Just bought more $AMZN here at the lows , Its one of my favorite stocks on this market pullback
3568 2018-12-14 19:40:02 All these negative A-holes are probably the ones panicking after making a boat load of cash! Or they don't even have stocks at all and are haters
3569 2018-12-14 19:39:34 Many stocks are down like that... All signs of an end cycle
3570 2018-12-14 19:39:24 With stocks falling daily as a political move against the current administration the thing to do is research which stocks are falling to ridiculously low amounts and buy them before they recover. This will backfire terribly on the sellers. They will get soaked.
3571 2018-12-14 19:38:42 Guy on @CNBC who told us (confidently) a month ago that hedge funds would be forced to chase FANG and high beta tech stocks higher into the last two months of the year - just (confidentally) called for an imminent market crash.
Criticize by category, praise by individual.

3573 2018-12-14 19:38:32 D'ailleurs connaissez vous la politique d'Aubade envers ses magasins ? Aucune comission pour le retrait d'une commande. Ne reprend pas les stocks pour ses ventes privees ou le site. Bref les magasins ils s'en foutent, ils préfèrent vendre via le site ou via grds enseignes.
3574 2018-12-14 19:38:20 @BitLifeApp Can we add investing in stocks to the game?
3575 2018-12-14 19:37:47 Said months ago that underperformance of/weakness in financials + failure of credit spreads to "confirm" $SPY high = real trouble for stocks. Now we have another -500 day (so far) on $INDU and $SPX closing in on my "last ditch" support level at ~2,550
3576 2018-12-14 19:37:11 Probably won't matter. They will inflate the stocks, push GDP higher, raise taxes and continue on.
3577 2018-12-14 19:37:07 Stocks are Crazy, you made out like a bandit and got out at the right time.  DRYS today is around $6.   Before the reverse splits is was over 10k two years ago.
3578 2018-12-14 19:36:52 @TuckonSports stocks been pounded to much to sell this was more than a dip lol not much more room for it to fall at this point.... If your invested in it than it’s def a buy at the price point and wait it out to rebound... it may not hit 52 wk high but somewhere in between 
3579 2018-12-14 19:36:30 and stocks will soar.
3580 2018-12-14 19:36:08 Bottom reached !
"40-year veteran of Wall Street with a knack for market timing calls a bottom in stocks"  from CNBC - Ignore the disclaimer that says otherwise

3592 2018-12-14 19:32:19 Someone on the stock market floor breaks wi d and the stocks go down 5% cant tell the strength of the economy by how the stock market is doing.

We won't be able to set our own fishing limits if we want to conserve fish stocks & continue selling to our biggest market.
We've always been able to determine our own destiny within the limits of treaties.
3604 2018-12-14 19:29:50 Worst game company, ever. The only reason the stocks have not plumbed down another 50% is cause the game has already maxed out its damage to the company.

3616 2018-12-14 19:23:47 Saudi Arabia aims to cut oil shipments to United States. Because the U.S. is one of the few countries that offers regular and transparent data on oil inventories, cutting down on stocks in the U.S. will transform how investors view the global market. #oil

 In an effort to drain the surplus of oil stocks, Saudi Arabia plans on curtailing shipments specifically to the U.S., a strategy intended to shift market psychology.

3628 2018-12-14 19:19:30 aka - I need stocks to go up again because my cronies have finished moving their money around
3629 2018-12-14 19:19:17 It has merit to identify stocks with potential. But the hardest thing is to wait and stay strong until real potential is reached. Imagine this reaching 0.27 and pulling back to 0.22. Then, from 0.22 to $1+... DIFFICULT  to hold position until that 1+.
3630 2018-12-14 19:18:41 Wine and craft alcohol is the most attractive investment asset which has surpassed stocks, precious metals, works of art @BEVERAGE.CASH
3631 2018-12-14 19:18:32 I agree. 3 stocks 8 mins is the way to go.
3632 2018-12-14 19:18:31 if $MO has deal with $ACB, then it will be totally different.  $CRON will go down as other small caps of weed stocks. no doubt about it.

3638 2018-12-14 19:16:23 These market drawdowns always feel weird because many stocks look cheap while SPX is only 10% off from the highs
3639 2018-12-14 19:15:03 Im cool with 8 as long as we keep 3 stocks, honestly the comp scene is gonna be faster paced than high level friendlies because of kill confirming characters but we will have to wait and see. Also isnt 7 the max for online preferences right now?
3640 2018-12-14 19:14:34 Most big businesses are toxic : Monsanto, Pepsi, coke, mcdonalds, KFC, Lockheed.  The toxic game aint sustainable, treating the planet like an infinite resource and an infinite garbabge can. And ppl continue to buy these stocks and complain about the same system

3686 2018-12-14 18:59:35 Melee has much easier edgeguarding, very possible early gimps done often, and a character that can KO at 0. Since Brawl no other Smash game had any of these features that allowed stocks to be gone in less than 10 seconds at times
3687 2018-12-14 18:59:22 The "time' to buy or short a stock is when those individual names setup long or short buy and sell points.  If you want to do well trading the leaders on the upside and the downside, stop thinking market and start thinking stocks.
3688 2018-12-14 18:59:03 La magie des bases de données "produit" automatisées et remplies d'avance par l'éditeur pour la gestion des stocks e-commerce des mois à l'avance. J'ai même appris des traductions de mes livres comme ça !
3689 2018-12-14 18:57:56 And that's giving a generous example. Imagine moving gold, moving stocks, bonds, deeds etc.. it is a change of ownership dynamics, not just moving something. You are over simplifying the issue massively.
3690 2018-12-14 18:57:23 I know, it’s a horrible. However, quotas are essential in order to avoid overfishing. Remember the decimated fish stocks of the 1970s. Also, leaving the EU isn’t a magic bullet. There are other international treaties from the likes of the UN that we would still likely follow.
3691 2018-12-14 18:57:22 @nvidia GG your stock is still falling, and your Biggest investor/backer is getting ready to sell all their stocks. How are those RTX cards treating you NV? time to come off your pedestal and back down to reality you greedy people.

3693 2018-12-14 18:56:27 In my opinion, it's Americans playing the short side for easy money. Our resources markets have been raided by speculators in US. They found a vulnerable suspect. The majority are garbage stocks anyways, so I don't blame them.
3694 2018-12-14 18:56:24 Take a look at the SNBs balance sheet. Central Banks around the world own stocks. We also have our own plunge protection team. Usually run through Citadel.

3708 2018-12-14 18:52:37 Niggas LOVE to buy and sell sneakers like stocks lol
3709 2018-12-14 18:52:27 Over long time periods, do dividend paying stocks tend to go up or go down?
3710 2018-12-14 18:51:38 If they're able to trace the call, that evil SOB needs to be put in stocks in the public square so every #SandyHook resident and anyone else who wants to can give them a piece of their mind
3711 2018-12-14 18:51:33 Stocks drop on 'growth concerns'... Meanwhile- the anti-growth U.S. Fed remains 'silent'- unless they are saying 'upward interest rate' sentiment.
3712 2018-12-14 18:50:54 No joke: i got a tin for a coworker probably 5 years ago. She’d never had it before. Fast forward to now, this person is now my boss at a new job. Guess which teas she stocks in the break room and attributes to me? So, highly successful gift haha
3713 2018-12-14 18:50:44 Social media stocks $FB and $TWTR are bucking the trend today -- they are up in a down market.

3715 2018-12-14 18:50:12 I really wish the stocks were a thing.
3716 2018-12-14 18:49:33 Absolutely, I check you messages daily as every day is a learning and your stock analysis is something which I have NEVER EVER seen elsewhere. Your red flag on some stocks was very very helpful. Like Murdeshwar ceramics which I replied with the guy who reco.. Pls continue!!!
3717 2018-12-14 18:49:14 And that’s why the stocks are tanking again today?
3718 2018-12-14 18:48:36 How far do stocks have to fall before we all admit that Barron is the smart one
3719 2018-12-14 18:48:12 Just read that the reason the stock market is down today was due to fear “FEAR” of global warming. Are people just idiots or what? Amazing how “fear” dictates the stocks. How about reality dictate stocks? We’d all be rich!

3721 2018-12-14 18:47:50 don't trust anyone who thinks stocks can only move in one direction
3722 2018-12-14 18:47:50 Well it isn't the time to short stocks either?

3724 2018-12-14 18:46:59 Depends on your timeframe. With short term options yes, but with long term you just need to follow the trend. Of course...that's guessing in a way but hey. I like short term more because you can chart out stocks better than crypto.
3725 2018-12-14 18:46:54 Ima buy stocks today. Get this money rolling.
3726 2018-12-14 18:46:38 How are your stocks doing buddy?
3727 2018-12-14 18:45:31 The majority of the fish caught in the UK is exported, most going to the EU. We then import most of what is consumed, so the trade aspect is essential. I’d agree that sharing our waters is one of the trade offs of membership but international management of stocks is essential.

3739 2018-12-14 18:37:56 By the way, either you buy or tell your followers to buy the stocks if they believe this market is going to recover lol

3743 2018-12-14 18:35:18 Poor President Perp. Wonder how much of his own $ he’ll put in to goose Dow stocks next 2 weeks, and beg Mar a Lego members to put in, trying not to have his first full year in office worse than Obama’s worst year. Was down 2.23% in 2015, down about 2.5% for 2018 right now.
3744 2018-12-14 18:34:48 it's even harder with stocks because there you have mgt teams gaming it - announced massive buybacks and restructurings to flush the bears out. or like @elonmusk did, announcing a buyout to flush out the shorts.

3747 2018-12-14 18:34:29 Governance in specific scenarios can and will be valuable imo. Think about governance of stocks (equity holders). A specific set of people participate in the management of a business and make decisions which directly contribute to success/failure.

That seems perfectly reasonable, what is the problem

3781 2018-12-14 18:20:16 Buying penny stocks is not investing; it is gambling.  It does not create new wealth; it only shuffles wealth among the investors.  The expected return from trading penny stocks is slightly negative (because of trading fees).  >>

3786 2018-12-14 18:19:16 @EvenMentality  noise means that it gives no indication for trend change, doesn't mean you don't trade individual stocks right?
3787 2018-12-14 18:19:15 That’s the point, if we don’t buy Chinese products, their stocks go down and they might collapse
3788 2018-12-14 18:19:07 I hope you’re right.
3789 2018-12-14 18:18:54 Well, they’re not stocks

3793 2018-12-14 18:17:00 Geez! Get a grip! Also a sense of proportion & probability rooted in at least a rudimentary grasp of history.. Failing any of the foregoing, you'd better invest in stocks of an aggressively hypo-allergenic hair lubricant, for all that ferocious moustache-twirling you'll be doing.

3802 2018-12-14 18:14:27 3/4 Two more...no one knows future but to put some money in crypto, small % allocation, given elevated prices of stocks, bonds, fine art, etc after $14tn of global CB largesse hardly feels high risk. #BTC

3813 2018-12-14 18:11:09 @CNBC I lay this market volatility at your doorstep. The people buying and selling stocks are watching your shows and it’s a sick sort of self fulfilling prophecy of constant doom and gloom. And it can be witnessed most days while your on the air. Not all your fault but some is.
3814 2018-12-14 18:09:59 this 18 y/o kid on my snap is telling me that he started with $200 and turned it into many millions investing in stocks and that's how he bought a lambo and takes care of his family, but his friend on the phone telling me his family owns the bank of america stadium...
3815 2018-12-14 18:09:31 Quite simple, informed investors, traders, leveraged positions are first to go. So stocks fall. Then weak hands go out.. so more selling so yes people sell stocks and then they fall

3830 2018-12-14 18:03:18 Maybe the reason stocks are struggling is the President committed a lot of crimes, nobody will work for him, and that’s market uncertainty.
3831 2018-12-14 18:02:39 Sure, that's good, but there are lots of cheap stocks out there, I need forward business progress plus no hidden terminal risks

3833 2018-12-14 18:02:16 You are right in the sense that bitcoin and penny stocks are both VERY high risk investments. But people know that already, and grown adults can do what they want with their money, including losing everything for a chance of a high return.
3834 2018-12-14 18:02:15 You trim your hair regularly. When was the last time you trimmed your stocks? #rebalancing #FinancialFriday
3835 2018-12-14 18:02:15 "The continuing crisis in the Common Fisheries Policy, where 88% of European stocks are overexploited and 30% in danger of collapse, has led the commission to label its own policy a failure"

3846 2018-12-14 17:59:56 Are you trying to manipulate the market so stocks do not continue to slide?
3847 2018-12-14 17:59:43 Why do people still put the game on 2 stocks???
3848 2018-12-14 17:59:08 Yeah I've gotten upairs a couple of times, but not consistently yet. I gotta figure out the right spacing. But I've caught people coming down from it tons of times, it's a fantastic setup move to get high % stocks because Upair traps airdodges really well
3849 2018-12-14 17:58:19 Yes!!! But for some people its never enough. Like my man you aren't giving them 2.5 mill so be happy that someone is. "Well hes worth so much money", well most of it is in stocks haha.. Pinche gente man
3850 2018-12-14 17:58:14 Well even in patch 1.20 I got INSTANTLY matched within a 1v1 with items + Smash Ball + Hazards on + random stage (Norfair) #SmashBrosUltimate

3851 2018-12-14 17:56:58 Deals all over the place in resource stocks. What a time to be buying mining and oil/gas stocks in Canada. #buylowsellhigh is the name of the game!
3852 2018-12-14 17:56:57 Beautiful. I should have done that..I’m flat in stocks but caught TSLA for a nice run to $340 area. I’ve been reading into shorting $UVXY...thoughts on that?
3853 2018-12-14 17:56:17 Your current opentrades have interesting coverage in transportation, financials, and oil. #stocks #buildingwealth #StockMarket
3854 2018-12-14 17:56:15 We are becoming a cashless society, but buy in property and have cash on hand that is always more valuable then stocks and hedge funds. Remember if the economy fails, the government only helps big banks get back it doesn’t not help you get back all the money u lost.
3855 2018-12-14 17:55:02 Note - I am not saying to buy $TWLO $ETSY $TTD now. I am saying that if the market bottoms and these names hold up and pop they are the type of strong stocks to consider. Always looking for set ups
3856 2018-12-14 17:54:33 Bayer just announced massive lay off after stocks are down!
3857 2018-12-14 17:54:11 How many times over the last 6 or 7 years have we run the headline “Stocks Drop Over Fears on Slowing Global Growth?”
It’s like the movie Groundhog Day, where we wake up to that headline every damn morning, instead of Sonny & Cher.
3858 2018-12-14 17:54:04 Stay in. At your age the odds favor long term. And no, not typical but is Trump typical? Find an adviser who can get you into safe harbor stocks/mutual funds to ride out the crazy. Be a warrior.
3859 2018-12-14 17:53:52 wow...somebody is looking for a year end rally in tech stocks!
3860 2018-12-14 17:53:25 And stocks all around the world. I’m 68, live in New Zealand and have been watching my stocks tanking.
And Americans wonder why the rest of the World is worried about Trump and his cowboy politics!!!!
3861 2018-12-14 17:53:05 "Send him down!" Two years hard labour and public shaming in the stocks. Too much?

3867 2018-12-14 17:50:45 ... a million dollars in stocks, so I'd be a victim to this to.
3868 2018-12-14 17:50:39 Or hyperbole. Headlines suggest stocks surge and plunge frequently.
3869 2018-12-14 17:50:05 Hmm will Woollim send their male trainees this time round? LJY would be smart enough not to send Golcha if he doesn't want to cannibalize his stocks. Plus, in Golcha's talent I trust. 2019 will be a good year for them.

3871 2018-12-14 17:49:47 Maybe investors should sell off all stocks. If it isn't China trade, or tariffs, now they're whining about global slowdown that they'll never fix.
3872 2018-12-14 17:47:42 Stable stocks just aren’t as fun. I guess it’s my form of gambling

3879 2018-12-14 17:45:42 I like stocks that are volatile
3880 2018-12-14 17:45:41 Keeping it simple, QE artificially made certain asset prices rise in value. QT will then have the adverse effect,  these artificially inflated assets must decrease in value, stocks, bonds, real estate etc.

3882 2018-12-14 17:44:47 I'm glad you enjoyed my latest video! What are some stocks on your watchlist?
3883 2018-12-14 17:44:38 Best time to buy gold is after collapse when no one wants to buy.
Best time to buy stocks is after everyone has lost everything.
Hold money till market reaches 18,000 to 19,000 then buy stock.
I figure by April 2019 stock market will be about ready.
3884 2018-12-14 17:43:41 Finally, DT is obsessive abt the Dow Jones (I personally think he has a deal with a interested party and a contingent payment of the level of DJ) and if there is no deal, watch US stocks!

3888 2018-12-14 17:42:35 Stocks plummeting to biggest loses ever. We are heading into a recession
3889 2018-12-14 17:42:08 If you have trouble imagining a loss in the stock market, you shouldn't be in stocks -  John C. Bogle
3890 2018-12-14 17:42:00 J&J Asbestos Report Pulls Health Care Stocks Down. Health care stocks struggling as news that Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that talcum baby powder contained asbestos pushed that major sector component lower.
3891 2018-12-14 17:41:38 Crypto was the canary for the entire investment market, dropping earlier than stocks b/c it's more speculative but part of that environment nevertheless. BTC will drop to $2114 by Jan 1, 2019.
3892 2018-12-14 17:41:28 Stocks are on pace to end the year at their lowest level in months. You’re going to prison and you’re a liar and a fraud.
3893 2018-12-14 17:41:05 Not calling you an idiot, but anything with a $ symbol in front of it usually means it is some kind of stock symbol. Like $AMZN for Amazon stocks, $FB for Facebook, $GOOGL for Google parent company, Alphabet Inc.
3894 2018-12-14 17:40:54 One thing I've learned in 35 yrs. of trading: Just because the"market" (Dow, NASDAQ, etc.) makes a low, that doesn't mean it's time to load up on individual stocks. You can still whip around for weeks or even months before volatility subsides and stocks start to move in earnest.
3895 2018-12-14 17:40:47 $spy $vnda still same rules apply... u need to see p > PDH. and... dislcaimer... not good market environemnt for longing stocks. u have been warned.

3909 2018-12-14 17:35:55 We went to cash on Oct. 4. Put a few test trades on when there was a brief glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel, but that quickly evaporated. With few stocks meeting my criteria, it's impossible to turn bullish at this time.

3922 2018-12-14 17:27:43 The best way to make them realize their idiotic mistake is by selling all your stocks. (It's dropping anyway) and not spending any money on any of their other games. Boycott it all. Then when they finally listen to the people who matter (not @Activision) Resume financial support

3944 2018-12-14 17:17:28 I keep hearing, we are only down 11%.  Are you kidding me?  You need to look at all the stocks, not just $SPX.  So many down way more that 20%.  It is ugly. Transports closing in on 20% down.  So are you buying here?
3945 2018-12-14 17:16:52 @SEC_Enforcement needs to make a statement here, these accounts should be allowed and are no different to what schwab and vanguard offer, both have deposit & money markets that pay 2% with no requirement to invest in stocks, let @RobinhoodApp INNOVATE!!! @CNBC should investigate

3952 2018-12-14 17:14:41 yea but the US stock market is inflationary. ppl will be able to buy smaller and smaller amounts of stock as purchase power dwindles

point is da only reason stocks go up is cuz banks print $ and dump it in stocks no normal person is pushing stocks higher

3953 2018-12-14 17:14:17 When the next market implosion comes (a real, lasting one - not one of these quick hits that get turned by a hit from Uncle Sugar), many investors are going to be shocked to find stocks they used to easily trade either have no bids or trade only "by appointment".

3962 2018-12-14 17:11:20 How low can stocks go?  Well China is down over 20%.   If the USA stock dropped 20%, the Dow would be around 20,000 or 4,000 points lower than today.
3963 2018-12-14 17:11:19 A beautiful inspiration for a Friday is to see, Citibank, Microsoft and Google's Stocks dropping. That's the price you pay for Corporate Fasciem
I think I am getting aroused just hope for them to all fail.  #FridayFeeling
3964 2018-12-14 17:11:10 $spy $tsla closed this one out. overall market as mentioned not favorable for longing stocks here.
3965 2018-12-14 17:10:50 This article does not seem accurate to me,Schwab has deposit accounts in brokerage account which are protected.Schwab & Vanguard have money markets with checking&debit cards. I called both and they are protected, no requirement to invest in stocks, SEC needs to make a statement
3966 2018-12-14 17:10:20 @FollowMomentm hi. How do you pick the stocks? How do you keep targets and stop loss. Thank you
3967 2018-12-14 17:09:59 Dave - have you found over the years that when everyone seems to think they know, the opposite happens? Feel like everyone wants to be short or out of stocks and I just can't accept that everyone will be right. The herd is never right. Maybe I'm the mark though
3968 2018-12-14 17:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda

3970 2018-12-14 17:09:29 and when the Chinese companies become legit, will be less than now, they will have such vast stocks built up
3971 2018-12-14 17:09:27 Stocks open lower but are quickly cutting into losses.
3972 2018-12-14 17:09:01 Some stocks trading at decent valuations:

$HPE $LUV $MO $T $UPS
3973 2018-12-14 17:08:53 Haven’t most stocks crashed allready? Isn’t it a saying that 25% - 30% down is a stock market crash? I mean even after 10% it’s legit to call it a crash, but more conservatives say 30%. Even tough you had 80% is in the 1920’s. The term crash is used as mentioned above around 30%.
3974 2018-12-14 17:08:44 I felt absolutely no joy these past few days in the #StockMarket. Occasional relief rallies followed by stocks tumbling again & again.

3979 2018-12-14 17:07:18 What's your best investment idea for 2019?  I'm avoiding stocks and plan on just keeping money invested in US 90 day treasuries...earnings a little more than 2%.   Looking at precious metals too.  What about you?
3980 2018-12-14 17:06:08 and you anna are one of the chief culprits for making us laughing stocks
3981 2018-12-14 17:06:04 What a great time to make deals on their favorite possessions

3982 2018-12-14 17:06:04 @HalftimeReport Yet when you look at PE ratios, there are a ton of good stocks out there, increasing forecasts, but this trashy show does not highlight these stock because it's objectives are to trash the market for Mr Negative friends over at $MS

3986 2018-12-14 17:04:32 decided to start investing in stocks bc adulthood and my stocks are currently down 10% just like the rest of my life so just fuck it all mane
3987 2018-12-14 17:04:24 At least China can admit this inane trade war is detrimental...meanwhile stocks drop and you continue pontificating about the virtues of tarifs and govt shutdowns
3988 2018-12-14 17:04:18 They need to bring back stocks to put dumbasses like this in the middle of the town green.
3989 2018-12-14 17:04:09 And the best we can do is possibly ban bump stocks. Yet tainted lettuce...

I will maintain the view rates are to low until SPX bubble has peaked
I am not sure if we have seen the final peak in stocks yet
Blowing bubbles is crazy imo

3995 2018-12-14 17:02:12 More Christmas shopping today...in stocks
3996 2018-12-14 17:02:00 both require you to file claims and wait in line i think, sipc is just gonna give you whatever you have left, e.g. the actual shares or cash up to a certain amount. typically it will be huge losses becos a bank/broker run only happens if those stocks/shares crash, bankrupt.
3997 2018-12-14 17:01:56 VIX tightened into that flag and then started busting out of it... Big up day could mark bottom in stocks... Mon?

4002 2018-12-14 17:00:02 When the public is most frightened, only the strong are left, and that’s when the market is in the best possible hands.” -Victor Niederhoffer, Legendary Trader & Money Manager #stocks
4003 2018-12-14 16:59:30 Never understood this concept of safe stocks. For institutions, I suppose these are stocks that are expected to go down less. For individuals, there is nothing safer than cash.
4004 2018-12-14 16:58:46 I’ll go out on the hook. Last week the Democrats caused the market to go down. That way they can sell stocks short.
4005 2018-12-14 16:58:11 The January Effect starts in mid-December, this is when the small cap stocks outperform the large cap. Over the last 30 years, between 12/15-2/28 the Russell 2000 has annualized 27.9% when Russell 1000 has done 13.8%
4006 2018-12-14 16:58:07 Who gives a shit about their stocks who’s all going to jail for this bullshit?
4007 2018-12-14 16:57:44 Well right now it is not a good time to be buying stocks. The stock market is in a recession now. A better option would be to look into trading so you can make money whether the market goes up or down. I am learning how to trade the forex market which is the most profitable.
4008 2018-12-14 16:57:38 I work for TD, so picking your investment will depend on how much money you wanna start with and how you deal with risk. For instance a basic savings account is risk free and you don’t need anything to start investing in that. It’s low return and low risk. Stocks are opposite
4009 2018-12-14 16:56:32 E no hard. Buy stocks every single day from every company, houses, create a "scholarship" fund etc
4010 2018-12-14 16:56:04 Market doesn’t like uncertainty... between the tariffs & the fed hikes, investors are selling the rip instead of buying the dip.
I don’t see a bubble bursting but rather very undervalued stocks with a very low historical PE ratio with no buyers. All eyes are on the fed

4011 2018-12-14 16:55:55 From your post: "lower rates negatively impact the value of NRZ's portfolio of mortgage servicing rights."

They haven't YET. But stocks don't look good for growth right now.
4012 2018-12-14 16:55:37 @realDonaldTrump How come you don’t tweet about stocks anymore?
4013 2018-12-14 16:55:00 No; #stocks finally are starting to react rationally to an economy that's visibly very little but nil-wage jobs, wages near-flat, daily big downsizings of good-wage jobs in many industries, sky-high underemployment - all leaving nil with money to gamble on stocks.

4030 2018-12-14 16:44:26 I currently have stocks in GE, GE is going through bankruptcy and their value has tanked from $9.60 back on November 1st, to $7.08 today. I keep holding on to GE knowing that they’ll shoot back up again despite losing $5 on them. Moral of the story, I’m loyal as fuck in the end
4031 2018-12-14 16:43:42 apple stocks rise by 69%.

4034 2018-12-14 16:42:25 If stocks are down bonds are up.  Here's the thing- if you have a full service broker like I do it costs money to buy and sell. So if you sell your stocks at a a loss and buy bonds THEN the market does a turnabout you've really lost .Point is do u have confidence in what you own.
4035 2018-12-14 16:41:41 "U.S. stocks fell sharply at the start of trade Friday, as investors focused on a batch of weaker-than-expected economic data out of China and Europe, sparking fresh worries about the state of the world’s second-biggest economy"so not doing so well after all, dickhead!
4036 2018-12-14 16:41:36 Other stocks to watch are CGC. VCBD.  LDSR.  ALL have potential explosive futures.   Right now projections have them all at 450-650% returns.
4037 2018-12-14 16:41:00 Stocks are in Negative Territory this morning on concerns out of China & Europe on recent economic data, which creates more worries over global growth.  MBS is currently up 6bps and Yields have slid down to 2.89%.

- All Stocks must be treated as a capital tax, “capital allocation”
- If Stocks buy back which are kept at the company and not distributed to stockholders or re sold, very carefull, those are NOT assets, those reduce the company cash and must be counted as a reduction

4093 2018-12-14 16:21:18 Creating more chaos for purely political reasons - to get your small base all hot and bothered - won’t change the fact that your epic fraud and treason are being increasingly exposed. Meanwhile, stocks are poised for their worst quarter in over seven years! What a pathetic con!

4095 2018-12-14 16:20:59 For long term investments, buy what you can afford. It’s not about how much you can buy at one time but how much you can accumulate over time.

Set a monthly budget for investing and use that to buy more shares of your long term stocks.

We lost 26 precious souls. It’s time gun reform becomes the norm.

As Senator I will fight tirelessly to pass Red Flag and ban bump stocks because as a dad, that’s how I can best honor those senselessly lost.

4108 2018-12-14 16:14:45 I’ve seen worse performing stocks. As far as value, thankfully I invested early enough to where I’m still ahead. All in all I believe in the tech and that’s what keep me around.

4151 2018-12-14 15:53:32 Yes because in future we need to buy a lot of higher no. of shares so we can't do pyramiding and also the risk is more with less capital in futures stocks then cash.

4168 2018-12-14 15:47:50 Not at all. It did. But did you look at what it was doing during the election? Uncertainty causes volatility in stocks. When the uncertainty is resolved, confidence returns. I don't think you understand half as much as you like to think you do. Look at the overall trend.

4198 2018-12-14 15:33:32 Currencies, penny stocks, and lottery tickets are not commodities. Why should bitcoins be considered commodities?  Just to keep the SEC away?

4219 2018-12-14 15:26:06 Actually many of the days lately... my take it that big board stocks/leaders got hit the most from fund selling, like $AAPL, $NVDA etc causing indexes fall rather fast but lots, really LOTS of smaller names were holding in easily. Even rising.
4220 2018-12-14 15:25:59 Our buyers have already been notified by prior complaints, We issued a recall of all stocks so I again apologise these were found in store, but I am pleased to let you know that the manager has now removed them from sale & informed all staff members. Emma

4232 2018-12-14 15:21:09 In theory, yes in free market, one could professionally be a pro "horse market buy side speculator", however, in reality it cant be done without illegally having access to non-public fundamental information.

4241 2018-12-14 15:17:40 U.S. business inventories rose solidly in October as stocks at  retailers increased by the most in more than a year, suggesting  inventory investment could contribute to economic growth in the  fourth quarter.

Will they do this for stocks? No 

Real estate is the best investment out there
4256 2018-12-14 15:12:42 We had a similar issue at our weekly. Was forced to change to 2 stocks in losers to make sure we finished.

4268 2018-12-14 15:07:25 Fears of slowing global growth pushes U.S. Stocks lower this morning. Here in the states, our economy is still humming along with solid growth, a
strong labor market, sky-high consumer confidence, contained inflation and thus relatively low rates ...  that's a good story.
4269 2018-12-14 15:06:27 There are a limited number available (about a dozen I think) - can put one /some aside if you'd like. The usual mug + unlimited hot drinks offer will also be available (while stocks last)
4270 2018-12-14 15:05:28 Exactly. The fact that any plausible case can be made like this against APHA says enough. It’s believable and they’ve been dead silent. How could anyone want to hold this when there’s so many beaten up MJ stocks? Crazy to watch.
4271 2018-12-14 15:04:17 My point was there is no concept of "evidences" to predict a political party's doom/success - because these are solely dependent on voter sentiments. 
However, in stocks, there is - because sooner or later the evidences bear fruit. While, in elections, they may never!

4282 2018-12-14 14:59:03 It’s a weighted average but the stocks with the biggest weighting have been crushed. More than half ( I believe) of all S&P stocks down at least 20% from highs. REITs and utilities aren’t keeping this thing alfloat, so what is?
4283 2018-12-14 14:59:03 Remember what TOM said. It is NOT a Metaverse. But the Metaverse sent them there. Harvester doesn't know what pilots are. He's just a parasite.

4292 2018-12-14 14:55:07 STOCKS:  The trend in stocks is negative.  Unlike other stock market decline, this market decline is likely to continue.  The world economies are slowing.  When stocks declined earlier this year, they recovered because of strong world economies.  Not this time.

4295 2018-12-14 14:53:45 Buena entrevista. Espero que pronto nuestro país cambie la politica económica y eso nos permita dejar de preocuparnos por stocks que no se venden y mucha gente que pierde sus puestos en las líneas de producción nacionales en favor de las externas.

4340 2018-12-14 14:44:52 The divergence between US stocks and US economic data over the past couple months -- particularly labor market/consumer spending data -- is more stark than it was in late 2015/early 2016 imo.
4341 2018-12-14 14:43:17 #StockMarket #SPX Why are Utilities doing so well and Banks so bad. Mkt thinks #TNX going down as Dollar runs like 2016. Stocks correct fully. FED speak in focus big time. We are on the fence

4343 2018-12-14 14:42:42 Since '16 I have a desire to invest in direct stocks. I'm SUPER HESITANT bec it's tedious,unpredictable& never knew how.  Thus, I invested my dividends to a New Policy in SunLife, w/c would allow it to be invested in stocks. 
BUT this '19, will take risk& invest ! #FaithGoals
4344 2018-12-14 14:42:21 @JimInhofe You can sell those defence contractor stocks to hide your purchase after urging @realdonaldtrump to boost defence spending. There are records & it’s plastered all over the news. You really are the dumbest fvck in Congress.

4348 2018-12-14 14:41:18 Never thought I’d say this, but I miss the Yahoo News integration from the Stocks app. Has been replaced by Apple News, which has ~no financial news on anything but household names. 

What apps are people using for simple tracking of public markets?
4349 2018-12-14 14:41:15 Well well... Most of the stocks I follow are down today, but they don't feel safe to put my money in... Anything nice to flip today?
4350 2018-12-14 14:40:48 Trading is volatile even in Big Boards and the C.E. who knows they never give people the exact reason why they give stocks a C.E. they can be for different reasons but unfortunately that is a risk of trading any stock.

4352 2018-12-14 14:40:42 Dear @Blizzard_Ent and @Activision I hope dumping a game with so many fans and so many careers involved helps you make a few bucks in the future. Because moves like this will only dump your precious stocks further and help you lose your customers to other games. Way to be loyal.

4375 2018-12-14 14:32:08 Nice post, Eric. IMO the biggest trigger is corporate debt. The fed rate since 2008 has been so low corporations have gone on wild borrowing sprees to buy back their own stocks and hence enrich stockholders. Rising rates will move them into the red—and quickly—ending the party!
4376 2018-12-14 14:31:43 Many companies are borrowing money to buy back stocks (at all time high prices) then rewarding the CEO with bonuses for hitting stock price targets. (MCD)
It's crazy.
Those profiting are short term institutional investors, the CEO and executives.

4398 2018-12-14 14:22:01 That's not what the car manufacturers themselves are saying. It's not just about tariffs. If there are significant queues at the ports, the "just-in-time" production processes break down (factories keep very low stocks of components, and rely on extremely prompt deliveries).

4414 2018-12-14 14:12:01 I’ve never said it wasn’t.  My case has been that the US was now subject to a it’s own Trilemma which meant US could only have 2 of 3 of rising USD, rising rates, rising stocks on a sustained basis.  From Apr-Sep you got “the milkshake” (all 3), but that now appears over

4420 2018-12-14 14:08:44 Very difficult market conditions with most leading stocks under their 200-day moving averages which means cash is my largest position.
4421 2018-12-14 14:08:38 From my experience, and many before me. The easiest thing, to the most difficult, is the following: 

1. Finding stocks (easy)
2. Buying stocks (medium)
3. Holding winning stocks (difficult)
4. Selling stocks (It's a journey that never ends...)
4422 2018-12-14 14:07:36 Only confirms what we were seeing in price action intraday! Price increasing on no fundamental or technical reasons in the underlying stocks. Like Apple yesterday holding it up at 170!
4423 2018-12-14 14:07:26 All right, a semi automatic rifle, but bump stocks are pretty common, and then what do you have?
4424 2018-12-14 14:07:18 Can somebody explain to me why stocks are only open to trade like 1/3 of the year or only on working hours Monday through Friday. Seems like a big scam and opportunity for whales and those with inside connections to pump and dump/scheme during market down time... bullshlt
4425 2018-12-14 14:06:16 (Unlike in stocks) Difficult to conclude or maybe persist with the conclusion (despite being wrong) because elections in India are only about emotions and there is no way to gauge fundamental strength about a party.

Traditionally, when you hear the word "investment" you think of investing MONEY in stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.

But it's also possible to invest your TIME and ENERGY into acquiring skills and creating income streams.

4503 2018-12-14 13:25:11 If by "value investing" we mean quantitative value factor investing, that is to say buying a basket of stocks which exhibit low ratios like P/E or EV/EBIT or EV/FCF, that may be dead. I suspect once these strategies are publicly exposed and written about, market reprices them.

4575 2018-12-14 12:42:28 Isn't taking a mortgage on your house leveraging yourself to buy more stocks?
4576 2018-12-14 12:42:11 You don’t know what you’re talking about. Stock buyback is not liquidating debt. As a matter of fact it can increase the debt to equity ratio. Stocks are equity.

4625 2018-12-14 11:56:16 the deleveraging is broad base - tells us that a massive strategy is being unwound: the passive/indexing crowd. there are consequences when everyone in the market buys the same etfs and stocks - you are seeing it in real time

4681 2018-12-14 11:07:39 Interesting..so in your case, how is the trend line configured? Is it applicable only for indices or even for individual stocks as well?
4682 2018-12-14 11:06:50 Also ask for the mode, as many in India believe people park funds in cash in Swiss acct. they need to check the real estate ownership of indian biggies all over the world and shell companies registered in Overseas with stocks
4683 2018-12-14 11:06:48 Maybe they should, y’know, lower their asking price. Much like with Bitcoin or stocks, no one is owed profit on speculation.
4684 2018-12-14 11:06:47 I can not say for sure.... However, I do know that some women are very cautious and very detail. So I would imagine they would be.

4710 2018-12-14 10:40:20 While still in the minority view, Saut was the second money manager on CNBC in as many days to express bullishness in stocks. David Bianco, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Asset Management, on Wednesday predicted a rally of up to 10 percent in the next 30 days.

4714 2018-12-14 10:35:40 >> Like penny stocks, the only way to get money out of an investment in bitcoins is selling them to some other investor.  As with penny stocks, there is no source of money that will come back to investors.  

Investors only lose $5 million/day when they buy bitcoins from miners.

4716 2018-12-14 10:34:03 Both. Every seller has a buyer. Willingness to sell stocks at lower prices causes them to fall in price. The falling price causes more people to sell at lower prices. It’s actually not that simple a question to answer. Good one!

4980 2018-12-14 06:38:31 Nice thread. Makes sense the quintile of cheapest stocks today have had worst performance YTD. And most expensive had best performance. 

They likely wouldn’t be the cheapest if they didn’t underperform. Conversely they wouldn’t be the most expensive if they didn’t outperform.

5050 2018-12-14 05:36:36 Either you are gullible or complicit. My guess is complicit since most corps said they would use the tax cuts to buy back stocks before the tax cut was passed. And I've changed my mind, you are a fool to believe they wouldn't do what they said they would do.

5059 2018-12-14 05:29:30 I wouldn't say whoops.  They absorbed the monthly bonus at full payout into our new wage structure.  For me, that's like an extra $200-$300.  Lump sum cash (anniversary) awards replaced the stocks, turning something with a fluctuating value to something w/guaranteed value.
5060 2018-12-14 05:29:14 I'm getting strong Visceral Games vibes from this whole situation. Blizz "pulling away" devs to do other things seems a bit off considering that their stocks are plummeting, and their games are "underperforming" in pretty much every aspect.

5166 2018-12-14 03:58:34 It's interesting that people have been wrong for a long time about value stocks making a comeback too - and Japan is one of the cheapest markets around.
5167 2018-12-14 03:56:38 hey slick,
         what will you call it when the corps that bought back stocks with tax break $$ from own companies decide to    DUMP  those stocks and prices plunge?
recession? panic? shitstorm?  
or will you be under your rock that day?
5168 2018-12-14 03:56:29 Too many schemes means over lapping of stocks which will eventually drain your portfolio, if you like buying things for the sake of it then there’s always amazon for that

5173 2018-12-14 03:52:10 I got matched with this Simon online and I got him with a 0 to death with Lucina on the first stock so he just SD'd and quit and then I got immediately matched against him again and he just SD'd all 3 stocks

I destroyed this poor man's spirit

Most bars and pubs (and fast food outlets, FWIW) only stock either Coke or Pepsi, though; so half the clientele is always disappointed.

5180 2018-12-14 03:49:18 Remember when NRA supported the ban of bump stocks?
5181 2018-12-14 03:48:30 I'm not even a big NRA fan. I think they fold when pressure comes with regards to AR's and bump stocks, etc. They are the only organization supporting 2A though.
5182 2018-12-14 03:48:29 U are the dope doing is, not anyone else. U shut it down and watch stocks go in the toilet. America is so sick of u, lies and your greediness. Thank god it will be over soon, but you sure as hell have wrecked this country.
5183 2018-12-14 03:48:07 Lots of middle class benefit from this because we own stocks. And if you don't it's your choice.
5184 2018-12-14 03:46:09 Chinese end users carry low stocks of soymeal now.
5185 2018-12-14 03:45:45 I’m an owner of many guns, I will defend my own right. NRA is now a business that is influenced by money. Can’t sit and do nothing about NFA and be a part of banning bump stocks and still claim to defend our 2A.
5186 2018-12-14 03:45:09 That congress people had to use a blind trust for stocks prior to taking office. I thought this was law. So I was going to write my congressman, and got distracted with plotting a novel. That's probably more important anyways.

5263 2018-12-14 02:52:12 Ah, so you have no evidence. Just burping up talking points.

5291 2018-12-14 02:27:41 Stocks fall because institutions are selling. People sell because stocks are falling. Institutions buy when people are selling. People buy when institutions are selling.
5292 2018-12-14 02:27:33 Oh shit the rumors ARE true.... rip.  The rumor is they are cutting all/most their development teams and events because the stocks tanked.
5293 2018-12-14 02:26:24 He is a scammer he will talk the market down then buy the same stocks fraud
5294 2018-12-14 02:26:01 Kind of like the value trap right before recessions. Stocks look cheap, right before earnings collapse.

For that matter, they look expensive right before they recover.

5296 2018-12-14 02:22:29 Asian stocks began Friday with small losses as the recent recovery in equities showed signs of losing steam.

5307 2018-12-14 02:11:45 and the actual source of OPV2? India, Indonesia, old undestroyed stocks? So many questions.
5308 2018-12-14 02:11:28 Trump has been a disaster to America!  The stock market crashed under him ... a lot of stocks went back to when he was inaugurated in
5309 2018-12-14 02:11:05 I saw his explanation and though I think he should have told his financial advisor long ago to avoid defense stocks I believe he did not direct the purchase. Trump’s business conflicts make this look like Girl Scout cookies.

5312 2018-12-14 02:10:10 Stocks can gap up or down based on new information with no trading taking place and establish markets at new levels.  So people sell because stocks are falling.
5313 2018-12-14 02:10:01 If I had a dollar for every time the shit happens my stocks would be booming.

Everyone knows  about that before they do open the account. C'MON man. They suppose to Tell u before u put money down.

I have ordered a bundle through a game store that stocks your merchandise. They got the free PDFs. Apparently there was an update to the core book PDF today, but I don't see an update in my inventory. Any thoughts?
5318 2018-12-14 02:09:18 I be so hyped over stocks. 
5319 2018-12-14 02:08:31 And what about those stocks?
5320 2018-12-14 02:06:42 Lessons learnt in the recent drawdown:

- Stay away from HOPE Stories
- Chor bane Mor is only Shor in reality
- Cheap becomes Cheaper

Resist buying such stocks when the testosterone levels are at the peak.

“Big Bucks, Attract Us” but most people only lose money in such stories!
5321 2018-12-14 02:05:49 On plane scanning. Transports, retail, regional banks, big banks, Russell 2000, mid-caps all new yearly lows. Total new yearly lows expand markedly with major indices still above. Normally, stocks and sectors lead indices. This is ominous. And all happening in December. MORE
5322 2018-12-14 02:03:30 I remember in 2015, I spent 2 months on #data bc my # system demanded data of about 1200 #Stocks, didn't took a single # trade for almost 6 months till the # model was ready, 2016 and 2017 were the wonder years, # patience pays
5323 2018-12-14 02:01:56 I think English is the universal language in stocks and trades even today, isn't it?
5324 2018-12-14 02:01:25 Pump and dump scams tend to be different but the scheme always boils down to a basic principal: shifting supply and demand. Pump and dump scams tend to only work on small and micro-cap stocks that are traded over the counter. Price rises they dump as you ask why shares crashed.
5325 2018-12-14 02:00:40 Interesting twist even though many tokens designed as "shares" are not meant to be used as money. As cryptocurrency tokens they still have many of the characteristics of good money. It is likely that with full interoperability we will be able to buy coffee with our apple stocks.

5327 2018-12-14 02:00:30 Mgt yup . But 2017 was something special . As I said before u could stuck 100 stocks on your wall. Through a dart at either and made 10x 50x. I made alot of money in 2017 and lost alot in 2018 . Even pointed out several times a correction was coming .  But I held most . GREED
5328 2018-12-14 01:58:19 Stocks rise, and fall, because buyers find sellers, and sellers find buyers. 
5329 2018-12-14 01:57:35 Since #stocks are "perfectly safe," right?
5330 2018-12-14 01:57:25 I'd forgotten about that piece. HFT algos might give the educated trader great counter trades but they're a major reason retail investors want nothing to do with stocks.

5332 2018-12-14 01:56:52 @waltshaub @RWPUSA @EdKrassen I just read @CNN that Sen James Inhofe, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, bought between $50K-100K in stocks of defense contractor after pushing for more military spending. Isn't this insider trading?
5333 2018-12-14 01:56:26 Increasing defense funding has nothing to do with the defense stock. Who wrote the nonsense article? Is the reporter a Democratic-hired? What a shame. Don’t they understand, at least comprehend, English? What are the differences between defense funding & defense stocks?
5334 2018-12-14 01:55:50 I use limit orders specifically to get .03 better fills than market order rip offs. I only use mkt orders in an emergency. I hope the stocks that are "not liquid" will be labelled as such, so traders have a choice whether or not to trade that stock.
5335 2018-12-14 01:54:50 Probably had/has stocks. I know people who worked at PM in The 90s and it was a known fact they had the packaging art ready to run.

5338 2018-12-14 01:53:38 Dude you are all day long talking shit about Bitcoin but we never hear you talk about FIAT ponzi garbage created from thin air or talking about stocks bubble which is the mother of all bubbles. Common man. Always defending Central banks.

5342 2018-12-14 01:49:50 ikr, did you see when you get hit by Chrom's suicide upb, not only do you die first, but it takes two stocks off you instead of one
5343 2018-12-14 01:49:04 all stocks often rise and fall together
5344 2018-12-14 01:47:20 It’s a lowercase w. Too much uncertainty! And nasdaq is down and basically all the stocks on my watch list  so it’s an L
5345 2018-12-14 01:46:45 How do you say Stocks in Spanish?
5346 2018-12-14 01:45:59 That, my friend, is why this is not for the faint of heart, nor those with a shred of common sense lol. Short sellers are wired differently. I feel nervous owning stocks; short squeezes just come with the territory. Never forget with every pump comes a dump. $HIIG $MDXG

5348 2018-12-14 01:45:06 Crypto, stocks and bonds are a disaster right now. Where are you investing?
5349 2018-12-14 01:44:50 No demand day last night on dow, Russell 2000 (small caps) leading market lower, considering they are riskier stocks and no ones buying them, it’s a risk off market= lower equity prices =bear market.
5350 2018-12-14 01:44:23 Haha you wish.  I don’t touch stocks with stop signs unless they shoot up.  So I can short them haha.  $kaly will crash.  I posted it today several times.  Sorry if your holding.
5351 2018-12-14 01:44:07 OK, OK.  Buyers are buying from sellers, and sellers are selling to buyers.  The sellers can’t sell unless the buyers buy, and the buyers can’t buy unless the sellers sell.  Since nobody sells at the high or buys at the low, the higher the stocks go, the lower the price.  QED.

5354 2018-12-14 01:42:35 Stocks rose sharply Wen Dec 12th, Industrials up over 400 pts, then reversed, losing most of the day's gains by the close. The price action formed a "Shooting Star" candlestick. The point to all of this is some degree of a top [stocks] occurred Wednesday. ~ McHugh
5355 2018-12-14 01:41:43 Can you imagine what would happen if the left succeeded in their despicable plot against Pres Trump?  Stocks would plummet, business would leave, small businesses would think twice, our economy would tank.
5356 2018-12-14 01:41:10 hey buddy

name has a lot of controversy surrounding it for sure but even bad stocks can make for good trades for short term traders. recapturing 50d is a big positive and then you have something to shoot against for a stop

300 years ago your Commonwealth would've crushed you with stones or hanged by the neck until dead. 

Stocks in the Commons minimum.
5358 2018-12-14 01:39:34 Stocks fall because buyers are buying from sellers.  No sellers, no buyers.  No buyers, no sellers.  

Got it?
5359 2018-12-14 01:39:24 What is an operator ? I don't believe in Bhoot 
5360 2018-12-14 01:37:26 Stocks can fall/bull markets can end because people fewer people are buying - same number of sellers turn up everyday as they did throughout the bull market but now fewer buyers turn up so sellers have to make price concession to 'get it done'.
5361 2018-12-14 01:37:23 Or do stocks sell because people are falling?
5362 2018-12-14 01:36:51 I mean kung may stocks pa po? Hehe
5363 2018-12-14 01:36:47 Pitching me stocks while I'm trying to write some bullshit isn't the surest way to my wallet.
5364 2018-12-14 01:36:21 Very difficult to buy stocks right now.  I’m selling losers and underperformers - ready to add to the horses in scales down.  But now is not the time, IMHO.  I’m no expert.  I started trading in 1997, switched to “investing” 2 years ago.  Trading was easier, in a way.
5365 2018-12-14 01:35:18 Well that and other gaming stocks and the market in general are down.
5366 2018-12-14 01:34:32 How i spend my bfast: 
-mcdelivery
-check emails
-send emails
-follow-up w client
-check stocks
-prepare stocks 
-watch tutorials (bc u never stop learning!)

This is a normal day. 
5367 2018-12-14 01:34:06 54% of Americans hold stocks.  This really only benefits the rich.
5368 2018-12-14 01:33:55 Entrepreneurship is entrepreneurship, bashing on others for what their doing to help themselves won’t do anything but just make you look stupid, if recruiting works then great if not move on there’s other opportunities out there such as real estate, stocks, forex, Ecommerce, etc
5369 2018-12-14 01:32:05 Just want to clarify. You think there’s a decent chance stocks hit 2189 in the next two weeks and 1850 by the end of January. ?

5372 2018-12-14 01:30:57 Meanwhile, in other news. a barn owl sneezed & blew new corn stocks over and covered the farm equipment with enough moisture to cause immediate rusting.

5379 2018-12-14 01:25:48 TWN Stocks: Don't go near appliance maker Tatung (2371大同) - it owns a lot of Taiwanese land, to be sure, all of which will be consumed by its staggering losses.
5380 2018-12-14 01:24:14 Corporations also used the trillion $ tax cut you gave them to buy back stocks.  Not a wise conversation for Marco.
5381 2018-12-14 01:23:40 Please remain humble now that you're filthy rich. May I suggest you invest it in stocks and bonds?  
5382 2018-12-14 01:22:43 They literally said they would buy back stocks and not pass it on to the employees. They literally said that. You STILL gave them the tax break. You are delusional.

5384 2018-12-14 01:20:27 Stock bull counter:  "There's so much ca$h on the sideline stocks have to go up.   It's gonna rip."   My oldest son asked me today (not kidding) "Why do stocks just go up".   I said stock guys just wave shit in.  Bond guys actually think twice.
5385 2018-12-14 01:20:16 This is their S.O.P
Every fucking time the @GOP gives big businesses a tax break/cut they buy back stocks
5386 2018-12-14 01:19:43 But you were front and center in passing a tax law that allowed the corporations to have lots of money to buy back the stocks, as most economists predicted they would. So what are you trying to accomplish by this tweet? You are part of the problem , get it? #Hypocrite
5387 2018-12-14 01:19:28 When has a planners role ever been to pick stocks???
5388 2018-12-14 01:19:03 If u think a 1000 point fall on the #nifty creates "value" in stocks, you are a trader & not an investor 
5389 2018-12-14 01:18:11 Siguen llorando la baja en el consumo per cápita de vino pero de bajar precios (para bajar stocks), ni hablar, todo lo contrario, aumentan y aumentan! Asi no va, ni va a ir
5390 2018-12-14 01:15:54 Totally absurd.  Know-nothings like Ocasio-Cortez are laughing stocks.  It is reassuring to see that up&coming demo-socialists are complete nincompoops. This is probably driving YOU crazy.  Thanks for projecting. 
5391 2018-12-14 01:15:43 2. As much as I think you are probably the most talented DT I’ve ever seen, a few other things made it difficult like shorting penny stocks with TD, often times difficult to hear you on mike no matter how much my volume was up and lastly keeping up with the Chat room.

5393 2018-12-14 01:12:13 Stocks down + Vix down = vix is telling you that downside is becoming limited.. coincident is stocks down + vix up

5395 2018-12-14 01:10:07 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
5396 2018-12-14 01:10:00 $Apha will be fine in time but nothing is happening right away.....Check stocks in the spring you will be happier
5397 2018-12-14 01:09:27 In other words, the $TSLA shorts shorting the wrong stocks and long the FANGMAN stocks.

So, selling FANGMAN stocks on the way down and cover the Shorts on TSLA on the way up.

Great strategy: Buy Highest (FANGMAN) and Short Lowest TSLA)  Most hedge funds' model. Perfect.
5398 2018-12-14 01:09:21 Just want to double confirm, what ceo means is the cash I used to purchased stocks & stocks i’m Holding in Robinhood would be protected if Robinhood goes bankrupt right? (Like I would get my money back if Robinhood goes under.
5399 2018-12-14 01:08:52 Gimme is not how we negotiate. What are you offering?!!! You know, besides obnoxious behavior and crappy trade wars that are screwing up my stocks. #JesusTakeTheWheel
5400 2018-12-14 01:08:23 I'm 18. I've just been paid out $600 in leave for quitting my job. Should I buy some Jordans or invest in some stocks? 
5401 2018-12-14 01:07:45 I actually find @cathmckenna statements somewhat hypocritical - Tar sands? I agree re coal but ALL fossil fuels are to be targeted for removal. Would your pronouncements have anything to do with Canada's coal reserves being just 0.6% but oil reserves 10% of global stocks (BP).
5402 2018-12-14 01:06:31 which means that anyone looking for safe harbor in gold to hold capital may get their eyes ripped out to get the cash back to take advantage of deals in stocks after the downturn, 
so the question becomes is cash better than gold until its not? aka the bottom
5403 2018-12-14 01:05:54 ... besides the positive narrative, to some part could have been short sellers that both have to liquidate their falling long positions (in other stocks) and need to buy TSLA.
5404 2018-12-14 01:04:27 Thats why I follow you, been discussing this for a few years, the goldbugs think gold is the safe bet, in a mess everything is a lost cause, especially as many boomers or others use gold to hedge, so they dont have to sell stocks at half price during a big down turn
5405 2018-12-14 01:04:16 There is diff. When you put 10k in FDIC insured bank, you get 10k back when the bank goes dead. In SPIC, will you get 10k back or will you get $ value at market rate even you have 0 position in any stocks or securities
5406 2018-12-14 01:03:36 Not to mention, these customers have cash in place to quickly buy stocks for zero fees. I’m wondering if this is a better place to stash my emergency fund though..
5407 2018-12-14 01:03:07 I bet I would have won, even though I'd lost all my stocks
5408 2018-12-14 01:02:58 I believe #coinbase added the "follow feature" in order to see which coin was most followed; sort of a sneaky way to add the most followed stocks. I added #xrp and #vet. Who knows what will start the next bullrun..  To many haters on both sides. Just play the game  #JPTG!!
5409 2018-12-14 01:02:46 Wealth begets more wealth.  Those with money, generally have stocks, investments, speeches, book deals. Also, government experience is worth $$ to law firms, political groups, etc.  Sell tens of millions of copies of a book and you're going to be doing pretty well for yourself.
5410 2018-12-14 01:02:19 Yes, you're correct, but still.. price IS price, and we have a series of lower highs and lower lows. The defense stocks are struggling.... no real sign of that ending.
5411 2018-12-14 01:01:41 Seryoso ba 'to? Hahahaha. Punta ka dun ng Monday kasi dun darating yung mga stocks nila

5413 2018-12-14 00:59:10 All the money I wasted before should’ve been invested in stocks, but lesson learned. I’m 20 now
5414 2018-12-14 00:57:50 Lol  such wit.. except few, most stocks are still expensive..
5415 2018-12-14 00:57:18 I see it as this: if you’re going to invest in stocks, you might as well invest in something that is going to do some good in this world
5416 2018-12-14 00:56:17 I let another car go in front of me yesterday and they did NOT flash their hazards to thank me. Devilish behaviour. Should be put in the stocks.
5417 2018-12-14 00:55:43 NOoooo...what a surprise !! #stocks
5418 2018-12-14 00:55:26 Stocks @StocksGFX
5419 2018-12-14 00:55:20 Stocks goes up and @Hedgeye drops it and no comments
Y'all should say why you dropped
Not good
Trapped shorts and you did it around $350

No position, just an observation
5420 2018-12-14 00:55:03 Never mind stocks option. Supposed to be a magic cure for cancer. Oil didn't help me at all. Just put me on a pluck.
5421 2018-12-14 00:54:32 Great! And @LenfestOcean has funded @GMRI and @Sci_Officer to better understand adaptation options in the face shifting fish stocks in the face of #climatechange.

5423 2018-12-14 00:50:43 idk, but i should have bought f****ing pharmaceutical stocks. 
5424 2018-12-14 00:50:43 @InstantGamingFR Ça fait plus d'une semaine que book of demon est hors-stock, le jeu a fait un succès alors pourquoi ne pas refaire les stocks  ? 

5425 2018-12-14 00:50:13 In my 15 years investing I have learned to stay away from Metals and O&G stocks b/c you can be right on your thesis regarding a company specific view, but it doesn’t matter, if the commodity price goes the other way.  And nobody can accurately predict future commodity prices IMO
5426 2018-12-14 00:50:00 Yea i in again at 0.0104 well see
5427 2018-12-14 00:48:06 Funny thing is I'm actually a pumper of quality value stocks!!!! Haha can't say the same about a certain dog shit symbol floating around right now 
5428 2018-12-14 00:47:53 I sold $gs at 195 off a basis of 152.  I was tired of watching all my gains go down the tube.  Financials are truely the house of pain. Cheap stocks that just get cheaper
5429 2018-12-14 00:47:23 i trade pharmaceutical stocks in my spare time  . . . . which involves a ton of research.
5430 2018-12-14 00:46:48 if happy Powell decides to hit that tipping point and crashes stocks....the WH tweets will be in overdrive as never before!
5431 2018-12-14 00:44:03 European stocks mostly fell on Thursday after investors digested news of the end of the ECB’s bond buying program and as uncertainty around Brexit continued to weigh on sentiment.

5434 2018-12-14 00:43:23 oil stocks benefited from a steep rise in the price of crude as Occidental jumped 1.9%, @ConocoPhillips and @ExxonMobil gained 1.3%, and @Chevron added 0.3%.
5435 2018-12-14 00:42:45 How much money have you lost doing the best stocks on their way up? And buying the shit stocks on the way down. Keep it up, we need losers in order to have winners
5436 2018-12-14 00:42:20 US stocks mostly fell on Thursday in choppy trade as investors continued to fret over the lack of clarity and progress in US-China trade talks and as president Donald Trump again criticised the Federal Reserve’s effort to normalise monetary policy.
5437 2018-12-14 00:42:19 How do you find your stocks to look at / pay attention to? Do you have a certain list you keep, or just use a scanner each night?
5438 2018-12-14 00:41:00 My big boss was called me, talk to me alone in room. He note his phone said to me. I hear you GREAT do work like hard work in stocks & trucks loading. Proud of you.

5445 2018-12-14 00:37:46 It’s passed as the only country (outside Uruguay) to be fully legalized.  That’s an accomplishment. Think #trudeau family trust had any early investments in cannabis stocks? #ThingsThatMakeYouGo Hmmmmm 
5446 2018-12-14 00:37:40 $COST reported #earnings after #markets close #revenue fell short of the expected 34.79B, only bringing in 34.31B #EPS also fell short of the #WallStreet estimate by 0.01 - currently down 2.65% in extended hours trading #stocks #investments #investing #StockMarket #economy

5448 2018-12-14 00:36:04 Chart looks  like a lot of other Tsx Venture stocks.  I’ve definitely caught the falling knife. Cheers to a turn around in 2019.   Company sitting on 11.5 mill in cash. This is a cheap stock imo
5449 2018-12-14 00:35:27 Someone teach me how to trade stocks WITHOUT trying to sell me a book
5450 2018-12-14 00:35:16 When @MarkYusko recently said stocks are 2x overvalued I would like to know the metric he's using...
5451 2018-12-14 00:35:02 Yo big same. I was down to stocks to a cloud earlier and then forced a ragequit about 90 seconds later lol. I love this big goofy guy
5452 2018-12-14 00:33:49 @stevenmnuchin1 @ddayen .  Steve, we just received a notice from the Treasury’s Tax Offset Program.  Wilbur Ross’s ex company, (he still holds stocks), Ocwen, hasn’t sent us a 1098 for 5 years!  The IRS knows this, yet we’re being held responsible for Ocwen’s incompetence.  The
5453 2018-12-14 00:33:37 yes
5454 2018-12-14 00:31:24 Isn't the @senJamesInhofe purchase of those stocks INSIDER TRADING?  #tytlive
5455 2018-12-14 00:30:01 C'mon. That's fronting for the Treasury. Why would Saudi give a shit about the overvalued US stock mkt?  Why doesn't the WSJ look into who or what is behind the huge position in U.S. stocks taken by the Swiss National Bank or the big Treasury holdings by "Cayman Island" accounts.
5456 2018-12-14 00:29:35 Yeah so I’m gonna need you to sit down and write down a few tickers Phil. Can you own tracking stocks? Yes? Perfect.
5457 2018-12-14 00:28:56 You mean the number of stocks below the 200 day is increasing?
5458 2018-12-14 00:27:06 Not a single for clue. Just know I passed 500 invites like 6 months ago and they cut me off from free stocks hahaha not sure how I did tho
5459 2018-12-14 00:26:46 Today could just be a day where the nbfc stocks drive the market to higher levels - kotak bank / auropharama / ajanta pharma  are some of the stocks to watch out for.

Unfortunately the promotion is whilst stocks last, however many stores still have stock of the collectables. Our apologies for any inconvenience caused, we hope to see you back in-store in the future.
5464 2018-12-14 00:24:01 its not surprising heroes of the storms esports division is dead, gaming company stocks in general are down, blizz down ~40%, tons of bad press because of a bad blizzcon (but not because of hots) and not really growing viewership

really sucks though, pro hots owned at high end

5471 2018-12-14 00:14:54 That's okay. Makes up for their shorting/put buying of Airlines, Insurance Companies, and Hotels/Leisure stocks the days leading up to 9/11
5472 2018-12-14 00:14:42 Stocks..
5473 2018-12-14 00:13:35 apple stocks rise by 10%.

5476 2018-12-14 00:10:15 Maruti / jain irrigation are some of the other stocks on my watch list
5477 2018-12-14 00:09:24 90% of the stocks ive taken in tournament so far 
5478 2018-12-14 00:09:23 True, though in this case, it's worth noting that oftentimes the stocks expelled from the index end up performing better
5479 2018-12-14 00:08:45 There’s really people out there who thinks 3 minutes is enough for 3 stocks
5480 2018-12-14 00:08:31 Ay ay sir.
All in on Italian banks stocks!
5481 2018-12-14 00:08:13 I like to play with stocks that have cheap premiums for options. I also don't like my socks the extra volatile play Amazon or Apple even. pretty much anything that is $10 to $60 is fair game as long as it has decent volume. I also like low implied volatility.
5482 2018-12-14 00:07:54 Asia stocks begin negative following the lacklustre lead from Wall St and with participants tentative amid key data releases including looming Chinese Industrial Production and Retail Sales figures; ASX 200 (-0.4%), Nikkei 225 (-0.6%), KOSPI (-0.1%)
5483 2018-12-14 00:05:06 Because really, there are only a handful of non-chinese fast-growing EM stocks listed in the US at a decent valuation. 

Chinese stocks just offer the best relative value compared to other EM stocks. Just compare $YY $WB $CTRP (after you subract $10 billion in cash) etc etc vs
5484 2018-12-14 00:04:51 Invest in stocks, not in man. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
5485 2018-12-14 00:04:41 Ummm... Lindz? No one has a problem with “responsible gun ownership.” The conversations need to be about AR-15s, bump stocks, background checks, access of guns by the mentally ill, armor-piercing ammo, etc. No one opposes the 2d Amend. But we can do a lot to prevent mass murders!
5486 2018-12-14 00:04:22 Gp up, go down. That's what stocks do.
5487 2018-12-14 00:03:50 Not really Trump is still a lying chimp, media is saying all is well, stocks not doing what is expected, unemployment #s are fictitious, economy is suffering, the wealthy are above the law, debt is rising. Sorry you lost a friend, try to have happy holidays.
5488 2018-12-14 00:01:49 Normal Americans don't save. Normal Americans don't buy individual stocks, margin trade, or trade options. Robinhood wants to capture the top end of the market; the customers existing companies value the most and want to acquire the most.

Watch for volume breakout on these stocks. Could present a great opportunity for an intraday trade.
5490 2018-12-14 00:01:27 must admit i'm worried we see a "last one out please hit the lights" type close to the year for the markets. no one is in any position to bid this albatross up. $SPY #stocks
5491 2018-12-14 00:01:10 Don’t think you can make a blanket statement saying that”none of the prophets and apostles were particularly happy “. Paul and Silas sang hymns in prison with their feet in stocks. Why would one want to become a believer if it led to being depressed all the time? John 10:10
5492 2018-12-14 00:00:44 Stock market not able to hold morning gains for second day. FED# meeting next week determines direction of stock market.
