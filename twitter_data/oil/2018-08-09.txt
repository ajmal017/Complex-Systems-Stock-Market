0 2018-08-09 23:59:53 I brought back white truffle oil from Italy & the 1st thing I did was put it on popcorn & the 2nd thing was drizzle it on an omelette because while I do eat bougie af, I'm always #cookingforone aka most of my meals are eggs or popcorn.

P.S. Truffle popcorn is better than sex.

11 2018-08-09 23:58:30 It appears that my 10 year old 220,000 mike Jeep Patriot is 2 quarts low on oil :(

13 2018-08-09 23:58:22 I'd pick a few things before a mining rig

1- home economics...teach kids how to balance a budget.
2- cooking ..because Ramen & hot pockets ain't healthy bruh.
3- mechanics aka how to fix your car (tires/wipers/oil etc)

Because if they follow those 3 they can afford a mining rig
14 2018-08-09 23:58:17 Seriously get all of the oil we require at home and we may not need to expand pipelines. Oh wait let others be responsible for spills, safety and the environment.  They will do a great job.
15 2018-08-09 23:58:12 Silly question. Can oil the bearing?
16 2018-08-09 23:58:11 Sorry, I typed out that tweet too fast. I meant pipes from west to east, not the kinder morgan. ON and QC con't to refuse to take our oil and despite this golden opportunity he's STILL proposing we buy from foreign markets? Rather than invest in ourselves?
17 2018-08-09 23:57:58 Oil changes for $10
18 2018-08-09 23:57:58 Oh my word! This guy doesn't get it either. Hello! Ottawa! Its Alberta! We have all the oil you would need. Its clean, too, unlike the crap you insist on importing from hostile countries. @theJagmeetSingh

41 2018-08-09 23:57:47 And they make their expectations and laws and the consequences of breaking those laws very very very clear when you go there to work. I have friends in the oil industry and the collision industry who have worked there. Never a problem, if you follow the rules.
42 2018-08-09 23:57:41 The Saudis were bombing Houthis into annihilation for many years till they had enough and started the revolt. French Total, US, and Saudi are involved since there are vast oil reserves in Yemen and they use the puppet Yemeni gov. to steal it while half of the country is starving.
43 2018-08-09 23:57:24 @WinterbleShow re:Peanut allergies, Brent the reason for the peanut allergy is vaccines believe it or not...thinktwice.com is where I found out one of the root ingredient in certain vaccines is taken from peanut oil...check out the website, eye opening to say the least.

47 2018-08-09 23:56:54 I’ve know my mechanic for at least like 7 years so we’re pretty cool with each other. I called him up and was like “hey man I need an oil change when can I come in?” And no bullshit he says back to me ”the fuck you need an oil change for?” I completely froze and had to hang up
48 2018-08-09 23:56:52 RIP. i heard using like bio oil and stuff like that helps for some people, didnt do a lot for me tho helped a lil
49 2018-08-09 23:56:42 This guy is really clueless...I guess he forgot that the beast he talks about is a creation that his people is  responsible for...He will be the first one to complain about terrorism, but not about his people who decided to go over there to secure oil, that created terrorism
50 2018-08-09 23:56:40 Le peak oil c'est comme Malthus. Sauf que le variant n'est pas la techno mais le prix que l'on est pret a payer :)
51 2018-08-09 23:56:29 Cause we don't have the money to take care of the vets that you republicunts wars you started all over oil. deny if you want, but we know the truth, and was even admitted by a former president. Better to save face, before Trump try to sit on it!
52 2018-08-09 23:56:20 Breakfast foods are being made. Spill the tea mask is on mixed w a little vitamin e oil. And now I’m just waiting  on my mans to get home.
53 2018-08-09 23:56:02 Europe can handle the oil from the Middle East that drives their cars though. Helps their economy funny that...
54 2018-08-09 23:55:38 Cajun pasta and French bread with olive oil and black pepper 
55 2018-08-09 23:55:35 Strange I have that feeling too. I think we ( you and i) should do something about it 
56 2018-08-09 23:55:32 She really put hot oil alllll over my booty & got so deep into it. I’m thinkkkikg is there a hidden camera in here bc she’s almost too into this 
57 2018-08-09 23:55:29 Thanks for clarifying. However, it's still fair to say that supplying Eastern Canada with refined oil is more than just building a pipeline, correct?
58 2018-08-09 23:55:24 Never cry after putting tea tree oil on your face. The fumes in my eyes yeah

64 2018-08-09 23:54:49 Saudi Arabia became a country in the same fascist wave that inflicted Europe. Their “monarchy” is just a bunch of hillbillies backed by the Islamic equivalent of Easter (a thoroughly debauched, irreligious holiday) and oil. It’s as if Kentucky was a major global player. 
65 2018-08-09 23:54:46 CBD oil , tumeric tea
66 2018-08-09 23:54:46 Do you really think we are scared of a country run by weak little men who wear dresses and hold hands? One day the need of your oil will be gone and so will any support you might have right now. I will enjoy that day.
67 2018-08-09 23:54:42 Haha the racing oil smells awesome tho, said to @CElfleet i will get to one meeting before they finish lol

72 2018-08-09 23:53:37 Maybe Shawn, maybe not, oil by rail now, and lots of It available to import
73 2018-08-09 23:53:32 Coat the whole thing with olive oil to even it out
74 2018-08-09 23:53:27 I love FP, but oh boy, I do hate populist arguments for it...  there’s no need to disguise the real medicine as sneak oil

76 2018-08-09 23:53:16 Is there any industry as aggressive as the oil industry?
77 2018-08-09 23:53:14 Are you aware how much oil canada has?
78 2018-08-09 23:53:04 500 mg Tylenol 200 mg Motrin, add bendryl. That’s what the er gives most of the time. Peppermint essential oil rubbed on temples/neck helps too

80 2018-08-09 23:52:48 Not a coincidence.... Supply demand is the factor... Republicans make the economy work, requiring the consumption of oil with higher demand... Democrats stifle the economy reducing the demand for oil... Ignorance is bliss...always a way to create Fake negative Points... nice try!
81 2018-08-09 23:52:38 @theJagmeetSingh I think it's a brilliant idea to build at least one oil refinery in Canada. Costs are enormous, but so are Canadian-built vehicles that also cost billions. Why don't we build an oil refinery here? Others whom I know have questioned that, too. @HappyKarma
82 2018-08-09 23:52:24 $308 for an oil change? 
Yup again my Godfather is the damn best 
83 2018-08-09 23:52:12 It really is something to celebrate (: I hope your kitty is doing great too! We started her on a keto diet (grainfree food and we add a fatty gel to make it high fat) which may or may not be the reason and she gets cbd oil in addition to her medication
84 2018-08-09 23:52:08 That could be anyone doesn't prove anything seems innocent  . What are you trying to imply
85 2018-08-09 23:51:49 One of my progeny broke my bottle of oil I made in a workshop. They can't make up their minds on who did it. They are no longer allowed in the yoga room. They gotta find a new family now.

89 2018-08-09 23:51:18 #Venezuela is a prime example of US interference in the 1950s undermining the stability of a country by installing an antiCommunist Dictator. The modern problems there are likely rooted in the violence that we started to exploit their oil supplies for our own use & profits.

93 2018-08-09 23:50:49 Go home and take your oil with you  ......

5. if a pimple occurs use toothpaste
95 2018-08-09 23:50:43 You can't shut off a runway diesel. It's burning its motor oil & will keep going until out of oil or it seizes.

101 2018-08-09 23:49:37 Shipping oil is not dependably on the price of oil. EE was economic until the federal government burdened it with regulatory madness making it uneconomic with time and cost uncertainty. That’s the facts.
102 2018-08-09 23:49:26 I've done a shitload of chemo and boshed an almighty amount of oil. If this doesn't work, nothing will  but it will  fuckin better like! Haha

104 2018-08-09 23:49:23 @Mobil1 What oil would you recommend for my 2009 softail Harley Davidson.  I'm doing all 3. Engine, transmission and primary. 
Thanks
105 2018-08-09 23:49:14 A simple wish. UK, throw Scotland out of the union. Say what you like. We’re too poor, subsidised, crap, never invented anything, scroungers, leave us with our useless oil & gas, if you want we’ll sell you electricity, rent out Trident for a fortune ... but rid us from the union!
106 2018-08-09 23:49:13 When did America get Iraqi oil?  Or Libya.  Name the barrel.

You will find more truth if you look to the UN.
107 2018-08-09 23:48:48 Curcumin, the oil of tumeric, is what she just started using.
108 2018-08-09 23:48:43 Waterproof mascara...I have the same problem, but my eyelashes are straight and go down. Waterproof is a bitch to take off but just use a oil based eye make up remover
109 2018-08-09 23:48:42 Don't worry. In a couple of years we'll be sending oil to you guys. Just hold on for now, and just keep up your carbon cap and trade discussions going...

112 2018-08-09 23:48:16 Drop my eucalyptus essential oil and it broke.. i thought these mini bottles were crack proof. 
113 2018-08-09 23:48:12 Canada can buy our Oil. Hahaha
114 2018-08-09 23:48:08 That’s because oil companies would lose money if mpg went up
115 2018-08-09 23:48:07 “International Biodiesel Day”, observed on the anniversary of the 1893 testing of Rudolf Diesel’s diesel engine prototype, which ran on nothing but peanut oil. The day promotes the idea of using vegetable oil or animal fat-based bio-fuels to cut dependency on fossil fuels.

117 2018-08-09 23:48:00 He takes Krill oil pills and is probably responsible for the over-fishing of krill and the Emporer penguins population fall in the Antarctica.
118 2018-08-09 23:47:53 Well wait even if he decided to stop buying Saudi Oil, it wouldn't prove he's for women's rights... Trudeau is a slime ball he don't give a crap about anyone but himself.
119 2018-08-09 23:47:41 Maybe Australia would be interested in selling us all their used oil to help fill the shortage.
120 2018-08-09 23:47:12 It’s a “moving it east where it can either be refined in Canada (NB or QC) or shipped elsewhere” pipeline.

Most of the Saudi oil coming to Canada is refined at the NB Irving refinery.
121 2018-08-09 23:47:05 There are a lot of people that want our oil staying here and not going off shore look after Canadians first
122 2018-08-09 23:46:59 Yup - I’m shesplaining here:  Mayo is something you can make from home with eggs and oil.  MW is a chemists concoction.

If you want to find a new & better job w/ a new & better employer, then I will help you. I’m in oil & gas sales & have changed jobs several times. 7 yrs of sales experience + lots of interview experience.

126 2018-08-09 23:46:44 have you looked into CBD oil? There are some amazing results from it for chronic pain!
127 2018-08-09 23:46:40 I would like to see the bitumen refined in Sarnia, ON. Everything is there. The refined product could be shipped to Toronto, Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces. I do believe that there is actually a pipeline that runs from the Oil sands to Sarnia, ON but I'm not absolutely sure
128 2018-08-09 23:46:30 Trudeau will only rise in the polls if the Conservatives take a weak position on the issue and side with Saudi Arabia. 

Conservatives should be pushing harder than ever for an energy independence policy (i.e. no more importing oil and gas from the Middle East)
129 2018-08-09 23:46:28 Are you gonna eat the eucalyptus oil? Will puff puff relax you? You know the right move to make then
130 2018-08-09 23:46:16 Maybe he was a little too forgiving to the oil companies and elided some details but the broad strokes are very good and compelling reading
131 2018-08-09 23:46:16 Red wine, white wine, extra virgin olive oil, tequila, buckshot, tums, guitar pick, doctor thingy, corn on the cob nailed it I NAILED IT GUYS
132 2018-08-09 23:46:05 It’s bad enough we get assaulted on a daily basis by the perfume and lotion smells (among other things) from the residents.  And in the summer we get the trash smell from the loading dock.  And the perms from the salon across the hall.  I don’t need skunk oil too.
133 2018-08-09 23:46:04 It was only a matter of time.
134 2018-08-09 23:45:57 BBC you have neglected to write about the fact that @theresa_may Britain has become a country that has forgotten its values and stands complicit with Saudi. Hummm not the first time though you have stood side by side with the US over oil ( PROUD CANADIAN )
135 2018-08-09 23:45:44 #1, there is no cholesterol in olive oil. #2, you should probably take a look at the ingredients in the dressings you purchase. Nearly all of them are full of junk, such as hydrogenated oils, sugar, & chemicals. This recipe is fine if used sparingly...as you should any dressing.
136 2018-08-09 23:45:43 Sea salt, Bay leaves, Peppermint oil, Coconut oil & Rose water
137 2018-08-09 23:45:39 Singh isn’t the one buying the oil, unless he plans to nationalize eastern Canada’s refineries. It’s time Canadian politicians (of all stripes) understood the oil business before they try to speak for it.
138 2018-08-09 23:45:17 Besides, there is no oil or poor people to bomb in space, so at worst some already superrich defense contractors get somewhat richer
139 2018-08-09 23:45:16 Wait so coconut oil clears skin?!

142 2018-08-09 23:44:15 @dale_hoogs try refining our oil instead of exporting it.

145 2018-08-09 23:43:55 I think I gravitate toward the studio pen and oil paintbrushes bc of how familiar they feel in other art programs I’ve used... but I’ll give those a try sometime! Thank u :)
146 2018-08-09 23:43:47 Gov stay outta the oil business..give tax breaks to Canadian companies to build refineries/pipelines
147 2018-08-09 23:43:41 It’s more of a case of a spineless PM @JustinTrudeau buying oil from Saudis but spouting about human rights.
148 2018-08-09 23:43:38 And I also used coconut oil on the ends! The coconut cooking oil. Not the hair one
149 2018-08-09 23:43:18 I’d buy mineral oil and start over if I built a computer that was over 31° idle.  @QuanFlix_ would disown me

161 2018-08-09 23:42:28 Made an appt to get an oil change. Still have to wait an hour and 45 min. 
162 2018-08-09 23:42:17 Mr Singh, we have enough oil to be self sufficient! What we need is for all people to realize Canadian oil is ethical and the best interest of all! Maybe educate your professional protesters!

173 2018-08-09 23:41:54 Oil in Syria was declining rapidly long before the war, alongside everything else, besides smuggling (by criminals), tourism (sites predominately built by non Arabs), pharmaceuticals (for the gulf of course). Only smuggling remained on course whilst others took a hit.
174 2018-08-09 23:41:49 Don't forget the Western support for dictators who buy guns and sell oil

188 2018-08-09 23:40:14 I have no problem weaning ourselves from Middle East oil...frankly, I’d prefer if we put ourselves in a position to get off petroleum entirely in the next few decades.
189 2018-08-09 23:40:10 Does not compute...
190 2018-08-09 23:40:05 Does WY Treasuer Mark Gordon not realize coal, oil and natural gas are all FINITE resources? Republicans like him claim to be for small government and yet he's sanctioning Bank of the West for running their business contrary to his beliefs. #Hypocrisy

193 2018-08-09 23:39:48 true story. company driver goes 200km to pick up a rental open top tank. (oil industry use). He failed to notice tank had oil residue still in it. Drove to base leaving small oil spot a long route. Fines and Environmental cost forced company to liquidate.
194 2018-08-09 23:39:44 If you read what analysts say you realize they are wrong most of the time. How many analysts said oil would never be over $60 again? There was a glut, but now with massive under investment that glut is disappearing and OPEC spare capacity is diminishing.

202 2018-08-09 23:38:08 It has worked over and over. The medicated oil loosens the taught, pained muscles, calms the over stimulated nerves where pain exists, and allows us the therapist to work more closely with the causes of those pains. People have found freedom again. We just scratched the surface.
203 2018-08-09 23:37:51 I also fasted for 5 days at the end of December.
Sometime in January, I found the Optimal Ketogenic Living page on Facebook.  I began to follow their supplement regimen.  I take potassium, Mg, B complex, K2, D3, fish oil.  Tried Niacin, but the flush sucked.  I also take biotin.
204 2018-08-09 23:37:45 fish oil containing a total of 3gm of omega3 will also do the trick.

208 2018-08-09 23:37:30 With only a few months before the legalization of marijuana in Canada, it is time to start talking about the massive potential to do good by combining MJ with massage. We started some 4 years ago combining cannabis massage oil and Reach Therapy Massage, to reduce pain.
209 2018-08-09 23:37:27 “Yes, we have trained and weaponized the Saudis, the architects of 9/11. (Let bygones be bygones, you know...especially when oil and US profits are concerned.) But once the weapons leave the US, we take no responsibility for the manner in which they are used.”

222 2018-08-09 23:36:11 Get some GW washes/shades to apply after you put your base paint. Nuln Oil is the standard black but they have many colors.

224 2018-08-09 23:36:06 We could be oil sufficient now, if the looney left had not stopped and or interfered with pipelines and fracking in Quebec and  the maritimes  provinces. Better to accept unethical oil from Saudi Arabia? And the media is complicit in this "travesty "
225 2018-08-09 23:36:03 Why are we buying oil elsewhere when we have our own oil that we can refine?
226 2018-08-09 23:35:46 we do NOT need production increases, we need to stop the americans from paying pennies on the dollar because they are  the only market that can be sold to. Billions and Billions lost in revenue and tax dollars because America paying pennies on the dollar for our oil!

231 2018-08-09 23:35:32 Yes @theJagmeetSingh you make a lot of sense.  How about Alberta? We just need a pipe between western Canada and the Atlantic provinces (Hint: it's called "En*@%y E*%t). That way we can supply all our oil from Canadian sources and achieve complete energy independence.
232 2018-08-09 23:35:11 My son bought some jeans for $50 with rips in & designer paint & oil splashes on. I’m getting too old for this listening to him trying to convince me that it’s a bargain
233 2018-08-09 23:34:59 10% of Canada's oil comes from Saudi Arabia? Maybe we do need a Canada East pipeline. I'd rather we owed these misogynists nothing.

235 2018-08-09 23:34:51 That's where the money is. There is no money in winning the PL as to do so means spending beyond what you will recoup. It is why winning the league is the preserve of oil states and oligarchs for whom the money is not an issue. Lewis/Levy and Kronke have a different target £££
236 2018-08-09 23:34:44 You do realize it was the NDP government that illegally blocked the federally approved pipeline to ship oil to the coast on the west?
237 2018-08-09 23:34:32 Yes to peppermint oil!! Look for a certified therapeutic grade....with high quality essential oils you can make tea which may also help keep you cool. The oil is much more potent than tea from leaves and will assist your digestion as well as freshen your breath. 
238 2018-08-09 23:34:30 Did Musk talk to the Saudis recently or last year life SoftBank? They're in the driver seat though now, they have Musk over a (oil) barrel.

241 2018-08-09 23:33:54 Globally there is still oil going into storage. There is ample supply available. The smoke and mirrors happening at Cushing is a result of Saudi Arabia cutting oil shipments to the US.
242 2018-08-09 23:33:50 How about a pipeline to ship Alberta oil to the east coast?

The recent Saudi spat is all the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later. 

So eventually we can stop importing Saudi Oil!!

The sooner we become energy self-sufficient the better our economy will become.

262 2018-08-09 23:30:24 It would be an oil drop in the ocean as far as real consequences for the Saudis (especially since EU, China, India, Commonwealth are not backing up Canada).  But it would be a good symbolic move.

277 2018-08-09 23:28:23 Do the Saudis not understand that once the oil has gone they will be left to rot? Are they stupid?
278 2018-08-09 23:28:08 Are you suggesting that oil going through an eastbound pipeline can never be used to supply eastern refineries?
279 2018-08-09 23:28:02 No kidding there other avenues for purchasing oil

290 2018-08-09 23:26:54 not going to have any oil to run our cars on pretty soon, so ...

why don't we do it in the road?
291 2018-08-09 23:26:40 Cool because buying Russian oil only bolstered a despotic regime.
292 2018-08-09 23:26:32 I never had the White asparagus but I heard that it is good with Olive Oil over it
293 2018-08-09 23:26:24 Like let’s use our own oil genius
294 2018-08-09 23:26:16 I make my own out of brown sugar, honey, coconut oil and lemon. Since I can’t afford the real bougie ones lol
295 2018-08-09 23:25:37 そうなんか！バンコクね、私今月末に一人で行く！！英語通じてる、、？言語が心配
296 2018-08-09 23:25:35 I dry off after my shower, apply it by hand wherever I'm going to be sweaty, and...get on with my day? If you're looking to combat chafing, I actually use coconut oil.
297 2018-08-09 23:25:23 He increase low quality jobs and reduced the high quality jobs there is a huge difference, just in the Oil & Gas he achieved a reduction of 500k employees in the USA O&G, just to give u an idea the average taxes paid by them was USD60k/year... just multiply those 2
298 2018-08-09 23:25:12 Just got word that my CBD oil was delivered! Just in time for the new school year. Review soon come.

310 2018-08-09 23:23:31 Does my sassiness upset you? 
Why are you beset with gloom? 
‘Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells 
Pumping in my living room.

Just like hopes springing high, 
Still I’ll rise.

311 2018-08-09 23:23:30 Me too. I always have lavender oil around.
312 2018-08-09 23:23:23 I don't think oil derricks constitute "infrastructure improvements" but I will check the dictionary and get back to you.
313 2018-08-09 23:23:21 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.

315 2018-08-09 23:23:04 Doesn't matter the amount. They still make a profit off oil, which is not a socialist asset
316 2018-08-09 23:23:02 I pump gas check the water and oil and yet i can’t take the car ?
317 2018-08-09 23:22:41 As you enter his memory, the smell of oil fills your nose. It's overwhelmingly strong, almost to the point of nausea. 
A young man stands in front of you, looking nervous. 

"You have to tell me What's going on.  Otherwise I can't do anything.  " You tell him.
318 2018-08-09 23:22:38 Oil interests know climate change is happening, they just want to keep profiting off biz as usual. So they repress climate science reporting in corporate media, cripple the govt with lobbyist cash & quietly push to solve the problem via less-than-ethical means (geoengineering)

320 2018-08-09 23:22:36 I was making a nice healthy dinner and then my Mom thought it needed flavour and overkilled it with balsamic vinegar and olive oil..
321 2018-08-09 23:22:34 Don`t forget, US want war with middle east, nobody else. Even the US can pay less, but the lobby is strong. What is better for the american? War for Oil or healthcare?
322 2018-08-09 23:22:30 Its almost too obvious..perfect goon for Russians.  The sad thing is, the Americans that believe(d) the snake oil salesman
323 2018-08-09 23:22:30 Say no to conflict oil. Canadian oil is the sweetest and the cleanest, let’s ramp up our renewables, and cut that madmax country loose. They are the opposite of what we are.
324 2018-08-09 23:22:20 Interesting we are willing cancel fighter jets over Bombardier dispute but not SA oil that can easily replaced.
325 2018-08-09 23:22:20 Um, since we apparently are going to be using oil for awhile and we’re sitting on more or less 1/4 the worlds reserves, maybe we should use our own. Funny how when it’s in “National interest” the West bends over, the east, not so much.
326 2018-08-09 23:21:35 So he missed his opportunity to said fish oil?
327 2018-08-09 23:21:32 We have enough oil we don’t need theirs. We need a government who wants Canadians to be self sufficient as possible. Virtue signalling is not getting us anywhere
328 2018-08-09 23:21:31 When the Saudis decided to leave the tap open and not boost the price of oil, it signaled the end of the oil era. 

They wanted (want) to cash in - whatever the price - on the asset they have in the ground before it is obsolete.
329 2018-08-09 23:21:12 Why the F are we even buying oil?

332 2018-08-09 23:21:00 Maybe they think there is oil beyond the cosmos?
333 2018-08-09 23:20:59 Yooo @Toyota what's up with these brittle ass oil filter caps??
334 2018-08-09 23:20:52 As long as it's cheaper to keep using oil we will keep using oil. As long as the environmental cost of fossil fuels is not recognized we will keep using oil. It's ignorance and greed. Future generations will pay.
335 2018-08-09 23:20:43 Always get sunburn but still will just put tanning oil on my face 
336 2018-08-09 23:20:34 Hypocrites as they disrespect Saudi Canada is still glad to send money buying Saudi OIl! Fixed that for you.
337 2018-08-09 23:20:30 Quite a shocker that they will still sell us their oil....they will continue to back down, as the last thing they need is to remove any barriers for a western country to constantly rip them about their human rights. If all trade was limited we can tweet every day.. as we should!!
338 2018-08-09 23:20:22 Sure. But there is no need we have a monopoly on the oil and gas. This is thunderdome.
339 2018-08-09 23:20:18 Oil and chipping roads may be the worst thing ever! 
340 2018-08-09 23:20:12 Jamaican black castor oil (edges) and olive oil (scalp) are awesome

Buckle up!
342 2018-08-09 23:20:06 Why don't we get it from the same country that aviation fuel for YVR is shipped from? Surely, we can't get oil from our own country.
343 2018-08-09 23:20:06 ... "Buy our oil somewhere else" eh! Definition of a politician; he sees which way the crowd is leaning and going; so he then runs out in front of the crowd and claims single-handed ownership and leadership over it. Looooser!  Jagmeet please don't move to BC!
344 2018-08-09 23:20:01 After chemist Roger Adams first extracted CBD in the 1940s, research continued well into the 1960s. That's when tests were completed on primates and researchers were able to produce the first CBD oil intended for therapeutic use. British Pharmacopoeia was the first to release it
345 2018-08-09 23:19:59 "Energy East" was never about delivering useable oil or gas to the East Coast. It was about delivering "bitumen" to tankers so it could be refined off shore... how is that supposed to help get us off Saudi oil?
346 2018-08-09 23:19:56 Not only muslims, all south asians suffer from the corrupt oppressive oil states in the middle easr. Most of them do not go thers just for the lure of money, many of them are neck deep in debt in their home countries.  A few years working in the gulfcountries is literally a (1/2)

You are so clueless & gullible
355 2018-08-09 23:19:06 you people have started again . are there no oil before bambam did hers. no body has a monopoly of a particular market .
356 2018-08-09 23:18:59 Will definitely reduce GHG if we use offshore oil tho

370 2018-08-09 23:17:50 We only use aproximently, 40 percent of our own oil, and buy the rest to use, it has been that way for years. If we open up refineries here, we would save a bundle and make more of a profit, but that makes too much sense.
371 2018-08-09 23:17:48 When I used to dab oil I would get so high and write YouTube scripts 
372 2018-08-09 23:17:05 Tell me how I take my car to a dealership for an oil change and they forget to put oil back in my car. Like how does someone not remember half of the job

376 2018-08-09 23:16:33 Yes, as does the UK, Canada... etc, etc, etc. Everyone is forever 'gravely concerned', but nobody actually does a thing because the oil smells so good.

382 2018-08-09 23:15:47 I bought some coconut oil today so I guess I can heal everything now
383 2018-08-09 23:15:47 Why don’t they make grease-proof eyeliner for people like me, a woman who uses a paper towel as an oil blot sheet?

392 2018-08-09 23:14:43 Wow! What a concept! I have an idea! What don’t we use our own oil? Ffs....
393 2018-08-09 23:14:41 @JustinTrudeau as a Canadian with ties to Canadian oil, this is the time to pull ALL Saudi ties.  We cannot afford to sit on the opportunity to take it to SA in the oil market.  We don't need them.  Make the right call, play hard ball with a government that violates human rights.
394 2018-08-09 23:14:30 The best feeling is having enough money to get your oil changed on time. The downside is that your car holds so much oil it cost $140 just for an oil change...
#Goals?
#5oh...
395 2018-08-09 23:14:24 Just a question why can't we have a refinery in Alberta right where the oil is
396 2018-08-09 23:14:10 Saudis enjoy billions because of their oil. The rulers keep most of it. Treat women terribly, imprison activists. Cut ties w/ Canada over a tweet. Grow up, you don't live in tents anymore. Stop the tyranny of killing children. @ananavarro
397 2018-08-09 23:13:54 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
398 2018-08-09 23:13:54 It's about time we shake that addiction to #Saudi oil. Maybe our minds will clear up so we can focus on the things that really matter.
399 2018-08-09 23:13:46 After the un-signalled, un-consulted oil and gas ban that will actually do nothing for our emissions footprint, I am skeptical about the degree of research that may have occurred.

405 2018-08-09 23:13:10 When I’m not sifting through the custody fight bills or flipping through Christian Mingle? Pouring my energy into restoring #civility and bringing Dems and GOP together on critical policy, like supporting the watering down of safety standards for oil pipeline infrastructure!
406 2018-08-09 23:13:08 どりーまは もうすぐそこです
407 2018-08-09 23:13:03 I went for an oil change and they tried to charge me way more than I expected. Gave me the most expensive option. I was like I just wanted my oil changed, I don't need the other services.
408 2018-08-09 23:12:50 If oil imports were to shut off into the east coast and the gas pumps act like a vacuum to every ones wallet I’m sure there would be many that would rethink their opposition to pipeline.

Bad News: forgot i didn't have a shirt on,  oil popped up and burned the mess outta me
412 2018-08-09 23:12:13 But for real, being back in Lucas Oil as a performer gave me such a gratifying feeling and I can’t wait to wake up and do it all again.
413 2018-08-09 23:12:07 My guess he plans to buy oil then from Venezuela or Russia...or both. 
@theJagmeetSingh would this be where you would turn to buy the oil? 
More refineries? Where? How would you transport oil before and after? 
Why not just pull out of OPEC entirely? Can we be self sufficient?
414 2018-08-09 23:12:01 I said exactly the same thing! Libs run down Saudi but buy their oil
415 2018-08-09 23:12:01 Me too, as well, a lot
btw-my saw arrived with needed, fine blades and, the oil paint for background of one small picture has dried. The great shapes of driftwood can now be cut into slices and rounds, some gold copper and silver leaf applied and some paint.
416 2018-08-09 23:11:55 I want to oil that cock and ride it

420 2018-08-09 23:11:22 Yeah , Betta check the Subaru's oil level. They tend to burn a little at high revs 
421 2018-08-09 23:11:17 Or they could use the money to counter using oil while transitioning to hydrogen 
422 2018-08-09 23:11:15 Lettuce, onions, procuto, pepperoni, oil, vinegar, salami, provolone, and obviously on bread
423 2018-08-09 23:11:11 Obviously not worth the time of day. I think you should have exposed her completely and let her receive emails and texts and phone calls from a whole lot of people who stand behind you 100%!  Oil?  Seriously?
424 2018-08-09 23:11:05 Saudi crude makes up about 1/3 of the oil stocks at Irving’s Saint John facility, the biggest refinery in Canada... time to put Energy East back on the table yet? #cdnpoli #saudicanada #NLhasoiltoo

435 2018-08-09 23:09:57 Ziyen Inc. is entering a market place where the demand for oil both domestically and globally is increasing, utilizing proprietary technology to reduce oil production costs provides the company with a tremendous cost advantage #energy #oil #invest #socialfin
436 2018-08-09 23:09:36 Indeed, that's why no one could open any kind of meaningful business unless he is "one of them". That's why zero money from the oil proceeds goes into the budget. Makhluf owns cell service, airport duty free zone, even the fucking metered parking on public street.

439 2018-08-09 23:09:20 Can't all be like you. Keep killin' bro. No way you could be wrong. But if you are that's why you own oil & natgas stocks in your fund, right?
440 2018-08-09 23:09:19 Broke niggas Jack their dicks with the same oil they cook with.
441 2018-08-09 23:09:13 When are we going to transition to clean energy from oil? when the tarsands hole breaks through to Antarctica? We should be getting in on the ground floor with early investment. You know, Lead the Way.
442 2018-08-09 23:08:51 Oh how I long for the day when I have a President that speaks of policy . I'm so tired of a self promoting snake oil salesman.

446 2018-08-09 23:08:40 My friend forces fish oil (rubs on his nose and paws and he’s forced to lick it off) and his appetite has finally become normal. He was doing the same. Wouldn’t eat regularly, Wright was starting to plummet but vet said he was healthy. Now he wakes her up to eat.
447 2018-08-09 23:08:33 Basically adjusting my diet a week before, herbs and oil blends and water. I only had one day of pain and 1 day of heaviness. Pain was managed with cannabis products
448 2018-08-09 23:08:31 Can this guy be more stupid? We are a resource nation. Canadian Oil needs to be extracted responsibly, efficiently , environmentally but EXTRACTED and Piped to market nonetheless. Another idiot Dipper.

454 2018-08-09 23:07:21 Tips

-when brushing you hair brush it wet and add small layer of conditioner to help with less breakage 
-wash your hair with sulfate free shampoo and conditioner
For normal oily curls
-don't add conditioner to the roots, this will add more oil to the hair that don't need it

462 2018-08-09 23:06:55 Castor oil can help with hair growth. Some you have to heat up a little and then put it on your scalp and others you can just massage on your head without heating it up, it all depends which one you get but it really helps.
463 2018-08-09 23:06:54 Tried fish oil, did not like. Have not tried coconut.
464 2018-08-09 23:06:51 Yoooo so I thought I had lost my ID and debit cards again tell me y I’m cleaning rn and I guess my drunk ass got home and hid it in my coconut oil jar  they’re melted into the coconut oil with this heat
465 2018-08-09 23:06:37 Wait...
When ?
did love make 
the world go around again?

I definitely missed 
that episode...

in this land of novice minded white people, it's been oil money making it go round, 
for last 100 years.
466 2018-08-09 23:06:33 Stopped by @Take5_OilChange for one of their famous 5 minute oil changes and they turned me away because they were closing in 8 minutes... 
467 2018-08-09 23:06:17 Literally means nothing; others will buy Saudi oil.
468 2018-08-09 23:06:07 The trump brand is literally nothing but a marketing scheme selling junk products (many manufactured overseas) of dubious quality for inflated prices. I would loves to see their markup and their profit statement. Smarmy, sleazy, snake oil salesmen extraordinaire.
469 2018-08-09 23:06:01 We will do quite fine without your corrupt oil. We have enough oil here to serve our needs....
470 2018-08-09 23:05:55 Hmm. That’s a tough one. Fish oil, coconut oil added to the raw food?

472 2018-08-09 23:05:43 The children became weapons of war. But, as long as there is oil, Western governments will look in another direction.
473 2018-08-09 23:05:34 Me, everyday:  I need to get my oil changed.  Today we do it!
474 2018-08-09 23:05:29 I agree that JBP is a snake oil salesman!

476 2018-08-09 23:05:02 I put chilli oil on my pasta tonight and I didn’t complain. I am amazed! I can now handle spice! (This is a biggie for me)
477 2018-08-09 23:04:59 We do not need your money to buy oil. We are in Saudi Arabia, the richest country in the world, and Canada must respect itself and not interfere in the affairs of others
478 2018-08-09 23:04:48 So we should ship logs elsewhere ,but we should buy oil anywhere but SA , meanwhile we are sitting on the third largest stockpile in the world,but he is against pipelines ,but let’s build a refinery .. a little all over the map , perhaps a few policies need to thought through

480 2018-08-09 23:04:41 That was directed at the snake oil comment.
481 2018-08-09 23:04:40 Holy balls… It just occurred to me that if Mars ever supported life, there probably is the equivalent of coal/oil somewhere under the surface.
482 2018-08-09 23:04:38 ali, go back to pumping oil, k? Next, we stop buying your tainted oil.
483 2018-08-09 23:04:37 今日の分はもう使っちゃいました！！
すみません、
484 2018-08-09 23:04:28 I’m proud of what Canada has done. Next step is too stop buying their oil.
485 2018-08-09 23:04:26 LOLLLLL my car has been running on no oil for about a month..... I’m such a fag
486 2018-08-09 23:04:07 I am so mad!

My all time fave and only lotion I use without rashes and breakouts on my body and face is the Johnson & Johnson original pink baby lotion.

I saw the dreaded "new and improved" sticker today 

they added fucking coconut oil! now its an allergen to me and my family
487 2018-08-09 23:04:02 Go look into mirror! Laugh at yourself. My nephew is US border patrol, we’re a military family that that has honor , dignity , compassion and we’re standing on righteousness. You sold your soul to the lying snake oil con man. Stop drinking the purple Kool-Aid!
488 2018-08-09 23:03:57 yeah i wanna use it in place of an oil cleanser since I feel like it would be a waste when i don’t wear makeup 95% of the time lol

491 2018-08-09 23:03:39 Most likely Patterson brand oil tank. Should have a band that secures top half to bottom unless new style with flange seal that bolts two halve together. Standard type round O-ring is the norm.
492 2018-08-09 23:03:34 Warning: explore them soon before they become oil fields, coal mines or deforested for riches!
493 2018-08-09 23:03:33 This is a headline-grab to take the heat off falling business confidence and the waka-jumping bill... just like the oil and gas ban was constructed purely to give Ardern talking points in Europe. Form over substance, again.
494 2018-08-09 23:03:29 Build pipelines and use the oil we have. Become independent from foreign oil whether from US or Saudi or Timbuktu
495 2018-08-09 23:03:24 Too many humans around here and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
496 2018-08-09 23:03:19 Living in Oklahoma has put me on to a ton of different shit. All I gotta say is “oil money” is no joke smh
497 2018-08-09 23:03:09 We should have a pipeline to carry oil east. What should we call it?

507 2018-08-09 23:01:21 My sister has cancer, docs suggest CBD oil. $80 in Denver for a dropper bottle that lasts a month or two.

521 2018-08-09 22:59:46 I think that's like 1/3 of it. Israel was the tip of US spear against Iraq in the early 80s. US has critical interests in Saudi oil etc, etc. The Goyim ain't always as dumb as they look.
522 2018-08-09 22:59:38 Siren: Vossert. Mateus is any of them but Volundr is the highest(by that i mean like...42 or 43). I can pop any of them on any server, though! 

Ive been burning extra oil on Balmung to gear my MS fully,l since i geared him ICly first. i hope they open it soon ;_;

524 2018-08-09 22:59:24 Unfair. Because these ppl have overwhelmed our systems capacity with huge numbers doesn't mean nobody cares.
525 2018-08-09 22:59:21 so you mean like... Ethical Oil?

545 2018-08-09 22:56:59 Why the felony, though? Was it the amount of oil in which he was in possession, or because reckless conduct was included? Even though schedule 1, possession of small amounts of marijuana is a misdemeanor.
546 2018-08-09 22:56:56 Now there's a thought selling Canadian oil to Canadians
547 2018-08-09 22:56:53 I know, but I was so bored :( I got my oil changed and it took the mechanics 2.5 hours, so I had to do something ://////

556 2018-08-09 22:55:59 He deliberately and knowingly fanned the flames of his listeners ignorance and hatred because it was PROFITABLE to him. He used his program to hawk snake oil to MAKE MONEY. When you defraud the public for profit, it's a crime.
557 2018-08-09 22:55:51 "You become unhinged and oil me into silence"... wow. 
558 2018-08-09 22:55:36 I just want to get this out there:

578 2018-08-09 22:53:04 It's both wild and not surprising at all that 80% of the problem with American politics comes from 2 brothers who gained their wealth inheriting it from their dad who got rich making oil refineries for Hitler and Stalin.
579 2018-08-09 22:53:02 Some ladies will bleach and look like concussion rice cooked with red oil with no pepper and onion and with indomie maggi to spice it up
580 2018-08-09 22:52:57 Ok. Now that we agree. Form whom do you wish to buy the oil. I have an idea. How about from Canada. But that will mean support of  Energy East Pipeline. Will you change party policy on this pipeline?
581 2018-08-09 22:52:55 That works then! But yeah coconut oil saves lives (and in my case bleached hair lol)
582 2018-08-09 22:52:50 I would hope you'd understand why oil is going up, it's the economy stupid, not gas efficiency.
583 2018-08-09 22:52:47 And what about my hands? How am I gonna put oil and massage them?

589 2018-08-09 22:51:57 MSM is now all ahoy for pipelines to counter SA oil imports. Never said one damn word when Trudeau was fking up Energy East for Denis Coderre & to save Lib seats in Que. Same when he cancelled Northern Gateway because he didn't want PMSH to get the credit.

592 2018-08-09 22:51:17 Pour it over coffee grounds into a used restaurant container and freeze til trash day. Add oil as it is dirty/used. I prefer Chinese soup containers.
593 2018-08-09 22:51:06 This kind of trade we don't need support Canadian oil
594 2018-08-09 22:51:06 Look up charlottes web. It’s a type of CBD oil. I heard it does wonders for people with chronic pain. It also helps a lot for people with epilepsy 
595 2018-08-09 22:50:54 @KSAembassyCA Why don't you restrict oil sales to Canada considering how it's Gov & it's citizens see you as such human rights abusers?
596 2018-08-09 22:50:45 Yes Canada here’s the chance to get off Saudi oil n refine our own bitumen instead of shipping it away in pipelines...kinda makes sense....just like human rights does. #SaudiArabia canada #HumanRights #selfsufficient #Canada
597 2018-08-09 22:50:35 Time to start a micronation. There must be an abandoned oil platform somewhere...

600 2018-08-09 22:50:26 Up to the future society — not us. The point is guns would no longer be needed for defense as there’d no longer be any robberies, burglaries, car thefts, muggings etc. Global socialism would also mean no more wars for oil and other resources between competing capitalist elites.
601 2018-08-09 22:50:22 It does not John

West coast oil reserves, that were not allowed to be explored because of the UK Mod are not included in the figures that I quoted above. They refer only to the north Sea.

604 2018-08-09 22:49:54 Good for them. Now Canada should cancel their contracts to deliver oil.
605 2018-08-09 22:49:44 Lmaooo no cause my ass be sweating without no oil soooo
606 2018-08-09 22:49:41 Buy Oil from other countries? Your gat is on a little tight Jagmeet. Might want to check where Canada sits on how much Oil we have. Am I missing something here??

610 2018-08-09 22:49:16 Agreed, it’s the market choosing their suppliers.  But Energy East would go a long way to providing options for oil for the east of Canada.

614 2018-08-09 22:48:54 Unfortunately, the solution in the short-term is already in place, but it's dirty and unpopular.  Fracked natural gas has already replaced oil (and coal) in many applications; policy removing KSA economic leverage over US would require commitment away from oil to NG in most uses.
615 2018-08-09 22:48:54 What's another word for dip stick?
I know. Check your oil, cuzz your 2 qts low..
616 2018-08-09 22:48:53 日差しが迫ってくる
617 2018-08-09 22:48:52 Yea it's basically a bunch of meetings with white guys and oil executives, as if it never occurred to them that saving the planet might involve other people.
618 2018-08-09 22:48:45 So.. If all goes well tomorrow, I should be able to drive my car. Just gotta fix the brake lines (no idea how, but that's what my grandpa is for), and that should be it

Then its just a matter of driving it around and checking the oil whenever I get gas. And learn how to pump gas
619 2018-08-09 22:48:43 Business moving, closing, layoff started in February and on the rise.  Latest victims in SC, laying off all 126 employees.  Element TV Company another victim of Trump tariffs. Food prices going up, gas up, oil up, some will need food stamps, unemployment and it is getting worse.
620 2018-08-09 22:48:41 Call Guiness. Got to be a record.
621 2018-08-09 22:48:32 Wow. This guy is a leader of an official party and clearly doesn’t get it. There is trade relation problems between our own provinces  and he thinks buying oil from wherever will help settle our own issues. Dumbass. This guy can’t lead preschoolers out to recess. 
622 2018-08-09 22:48:30 An AAA card is a must 4 emergencies. If u must jump urvbattery, there r battery chargers that you can charge from the cigarette lighter plug. You can get a basic $29 oil change from Pep Boys & have them check your other fluids like coolant & have them check the air in your tires
623 2018-08-09 22:48:15 On one condition.
That Solar City will buy 1 billion barrels of oil.....
624 2018-08-09 22:48:13 Does that include the oil fields to west of Shetland? To best of my knowledge they immense?
625 2018-08-09 22:48:12 We have some oil we could sell you. We just need a pipeline east to get it there......
626 2018-08-09 22:48:05 yo wtf oil changes should be no more then 30
627 2018-08-09 22:48:03 Name a single special interest you plan to stand up to.
Before the Republicans took over America by way of Russia, there was a government agency that looked out for the environment. I seriously doubt you'll do a damn thing but rake in big oil funds and offer thoughts & prayers!
628 2018-08-09 22:48:02 I’m a bit more interested in the leader of the NDP saying we should buy oil from other countries, while saying we should ramp up our refinery capacity, while hedging on pipelines. Seems designed to please nobody.
629 2018-08-09 22:47:41 oil from out west would only travel 50 miles thru #quebec but we Prefer it travel thru the seaway from across world. #traitors
630 2018-08-09 22:47:37 근거없는 자신감이 있으면 근거없는 불안감도 있다..
631 2018-08-09 22:47:34 Sounds too easy, Alberta's oil is our oil, but we can't get it to the East coast.
632 2018-08-09 22:47:27 You need to tend to all those ETFs. The ones brimming with oil & gas stocks. That's some might impressive active management you got going there, chief.
633 2018-08-09 22:47:27 Hey @theJagmeetSingh we do have plenty of beautiful clean oil in Canada!
634 2018-08-09 22:47:24 The oil on my face right now........
635 2018-08-09 22:47:24 message from Saudi is loud and clear don’t meddle with our judicial system , we have our own laws and culture. We are not the west ! 
We may not like it and we may choose not to go to Saudi but we sure love their oil and investments. Keep politics away.
636 2018-08-09 22:47:23 Oil change today, hopefully 2 new tires tomorrow and then my car is good to go!
637 2018-08-09 22:47:13 I think @itsKarliWoods would be more fun!
638 2018-08-09 22:47:13 Brought my car in for an oil change and somehow the air filter is just gone who the heck takes an air filter or forgets to put it back in wow #life #thursdaythoughts #why #really
639 2018-08-09 22:47:11 Do you like brussel sprouts? Fry them up in a little olive oil and then toss them in wing sauce... you can do the same with cauliflower.  Dip in blue cheese...  YUMMO.

641 2018-08-09 22:47:00 Heated blanket and baths...CBD oil but I’m assuming you probably have heard all of these lol. Meditating is also helpful. I usually get really tense and anxious when I’m dealing with this.
642 2018-08-09 22:46:53 It would be good if he had an idea which other countries Canada can get oil from.
643 2018-08-09 22:46:34 They can take their oil and “shove it”.
644 2018-08-09 22:46:31 I use avocado oil in my hair.
645 2018-08-09 22:46:09 Next time I get my oil changed I’m bringing a guy w me cause they think I’m a dumb girl and charge me for whatever 
646 2018-08-09 22:45:58 What if they gave a war and nobody came? Oh did you hear? I think someone found oil in outter space

650 2018-08-09 22:45:03 Eat oily fish.A few studies suggest that omega 3 oil supplements may reduce symptoms in people with depression on antidepressant medications
651 2018-08-09 22:44:48 Stop buying oil from saudi and buy it here for one
652 2018-08-09 22:44:35 Not as cunning as John Wiley 'Coyote' Price.
653 2018-08-09 22:44:29 You left out counselling service and holy water/oil
654 2018-08-09 22:44:26 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Ghana 
is selling coconut oil?
655 2018-08-09 22:44:23 oh cool there's a space force now we must have found oil on mars
656 2018-08-09 22:44:15 Aww hell naw they fr charging me $92 to change my oil
657 2018-08-09 22:43:55 Ever try cbd oil for that?
658 2018-08-09 22:43:43 Okay Scotland  will just have to be be happy with $500,000,000 Sovereign Oil Fund then.
659 2018-08-09 22:43:42 I play clarinet and auditioned for the Oregon Crusaders after playing euph for two weeks and auditioned with a Clarke study for them and now I just got done performing in Lucas Oil. There is always a way and good corps will recognize effort and work ethic!
660 2018-08-09 22:43:42 Yes, lets use ethical oil for a change!!!
661 2018-08-09 22:43:33 No actually Cannabis flower. Just vape oil and tincture available at only 2 shops in Minnesota. It's really lame and not good for the patients.
662 2018-08-09 22:43:22 @theJagmeetSingh I really agree with your views to forget Saudi Arabia and get oil from other sources. But why not use our own oil we produce here in canada?
663 2018-08-09 22:43:08 Tuna oil
664 2018-08-09 22:43:00 Oh, and including HVAC technicians to pad the numbers is fuzzy math at best.  But, we should expect that by now from these snake oil salesmen.
665 2018-08-09 22:43:00 Lime oil
666 2018-08-09 22:42:41 @jiffylube get to your store at 6:37 when it closes at 7 and there’s no one in line, and they tell me they can’t change my oil because “we close in 15 minutes.” Thanks appreciate it. 
667 2018-08-09 22:42:38 Or use Canadian Oil?  Oh yeah, idiot PM socks killed Energy East and continued to buy oil from a country with limited human rights, supposedly something he is against.  The stupidity of this government is actually amazing.

673 2018-08-09 22:42:12 Oh what did someone find oil in space??
674 2018-08-09 22:42:07 Wrong target. Let's nationalize G3,  the Manitoba based Saudi owned wheat trading company. Then the federal gvt should sit down with provinces and develop a national energy policy that includes hydro-electrcity, oil sands based petroleum, wind power, etc. Control our own destiny
675 2018-08-09 22:42:00 In a group chat for our fantasy soccer draft and have some Man City fans claiming they are the best ever which I followed up with “they are pretty slick” it was a oil money joke. No one laughed.

677 2018-08-09 22:41:38 Yeah.  Isn't Canada one of the top oil producers in the world? Why would we have to buy elsewhere? I know Libs don't want to help Alberta, but seriously....

680 2018-08-09 22:41:18 I dont think Canada economy could handle high prices of oil nor economic penalty from the US if they think of baying oil from there loved government of iran. Face it, your gov is trapped alone and no one is ready to back you.
681 2018-08-09 22:41:14 And I'm originally from B.C. So this is a losing situation for you folks. But, if you strike it rich off of plastic made from the oil rock sands of Alberta, you can fly me out for a showdown.

685 2018-08-09 22:40:29 -Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!
It would be a disaster if these fires jumped to Alaska, which is why we are going to drain the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge of all it's oil. Safety first, examining obvious ulterior motives, never!
686 2018-08-09 22:40:28 I’ll be the guy who does the illlegal stuff since if the government arrests me you can just cripple them with by raising the price of oil
687 2018-08-09 22:40:28 Just the right amount of heat . And topped off with a drizzle of harissa infused olive oil  Thank you so much !
688 2018-08-09 22:40:25 Saudi Oil! Time to use Canadian Oil.
689 2018-08-09 22:40:13 Of course not. I mean they didn’t have any issue sticking it to US if NAFTA but heaven forbid we stop buying oil from them and buyout own!
690 2018-08-09 22:40:09 Why haven't you cut ALL ties to SA yet? Why r we still buying their oil? Why haven't U cancelled the LAV deal? Why haven't you closed ALL Saudi funded mosques and schools? R U standing up or not?
691 2018-08-09 22:40:09 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
692 2018-08-09 22:40:03 also, the failure mode (using engineering terms) is a total failure.
Failure mode analyze / life cycle analyze shows that when the product fails, the failure is costly.
Oil leaks
Blades breaking off
Fires
And now, replace the turbine
Ya but its free
693 2018-08-09 22:39:54 Why every oil field worker have the same shitty font oil field trash sticker swear I see that ugly shit 100x a month. Shit screams I have money please rob me
694 2018-08-09 22:39:50 The oil that caused the fires was believed to have come from the rods and the crank axle rather than the oil bath.
695 2018-08-09 22:39:35 Why isn't Canada using Canadian oil?
696 2018-08-09 22:39:22 Let's agree then that, given Scotland has more oil reserves than Norway,  the UK . . . As you imply . . . Has utterly mismanaged north Sea oil and that is why Norways revenues are higher. So why can't Scotland, as and independent nation, do as well as Norway?
697 2018-08-09 22:39:20 Welcome ladies! Lets "bring all minds together" :)

700 2018-08-09 22:38:29 Like I can't stand when someone is cooking with oil or I actually can't drink my favorite stuff like I used to like coffee  & water  I have a hard time drinking it. I get nauseated a lot 
701 2018-08-09 22:38:18 I may be naive or uniformed, but why do we have to buy oil from other countries.
702 2018-08-09 22:38:17 Not sure if we should give you a plastic medal from the dollar store or tell you that a picture like this makes for a good souvenir of that one time when oil & gas ran the show. Collect some good memories, boys, before Nov. Still waiting on the CoGOP to gather *actual support.

704 2018-08-09 22:37:49 I relate to this so much girl I’m so sorry it’s awful it kills me on the days where I can’t even do yoga  I always find ice helps as well as lying in a dark room with a peppermint/lavender oil diffuser. I’ve also found reiki to be effective sometimes.
705 2018-08-09 22:37:42 Maybe we can train some oil drillers to become astronauts
706 2018-08-09 22:37:35 Too funny. U can keep your oil.
707 2018-08-09 22:37:33 Very soon, the increasing use of electric cars will drive down the prices of oil irreversibly. The world is turning a new page and my counrty doesn't seem to be on that trend
We don't seem to be preparing for the inevitability of a world where oil is obsolete.
708 2018-08-09 22:37:24 The Saudi Oil goes to refineries in the east.  Without a pipeline to the east it’s not a fiscally prudent option - shipping by rail is too expensive (not to mention dangerous).
709 2018-08-09 22:37:07 Our flawed enviro policies are based on oil companies that own you pathetic / corrupt representatives.  Thats why the republican party is the only political party in the world that denies climate change.  You are owned by oil and its obvious.
710 2018-08-09 22:37:06 Don't please don't put anything in her ear I once put oil a warmed oil to be specific in my ear it worked but ear is very sensitive inside anything can be damaged permanently I learned this later. Rather see a doctor or pharmacy they'll recommend something but pls no oil.
711 2018-08-09 22:37:03 He should tell them to screw themselves and stop being such big babies. They are some of the worst oppressors of human rights but get away with it because they control the oil.
712 2018-08-09 22:37:00 Crude oil?
713 2018-08-09 22:36:40 It's the customer that pays any of penalty for bailing out, not the company. The company bails, the customer would sue is how that works. The Saudis can replace any loss like that in a few minutes of oil output, doubt they sue. Parent corp is American big, other goings on here.
714 2018-08-09 22:36:02 Oh so pakai micellar water then cleanser? Or is it micellar water then cleansing oil pastu facial cleanser biasa? And can I use biomiracle water instead hehe
715 2018-08-09 22:36:02 @antoni said coconut oil gets rid of that smell
716 2018-08-09 22:36:01 The big oil guys to be majority private owner for the electric car company whose CEO is uncontrollable.
717 2018-08-09 22:36:00 Solution; protect land & environment at the same time benefit from our treasure oil sands is a 100% leak proof pipeline on land and in ports. Enclosed conceptual design, automatically monitors flow, stops pumps, gathers leak in tanks, replace section. Up initial cost&low running.
718 2018-08-09 22:35:59 Or btspmkcwflltw for short.
719 2018-08-09 22:35:57 Even he does not want Canadian oil. How many non-canadians do we have trying to ruin this country
720 2018-08-09 22:35:51 I think my siblings and I eat yam and oil because we are just too lazy to fry egg and there’s a fry for one fry for all rule in my house and everybody has their own variety of eggs
721 2018-08-09 22:35:49 Okay lets run a thought experiment. I will pkay the part of the big oil companies that come together in a cartel and you tell me how the free market would stop them.
722 2018-08-09 22:35:43 Why aren’t you asking why Canada doesn’t put an embargo on Saudi Oil?
723 2018-08-09 22:35:18 TBF he said that he thinks we should consider looking elsewhere. Meanwhile I am wondering why we cannot buy our own oil..
724 2018-08-09 22:35:14 @Avon_UK a little concerned to read advice from a rep (to someone holidaying in Florida) that dry oil spray could be put onto skin ahead of suncream and it would be fine, she is “knowledged in it”
725 2018-08-09 22:35:09 If alternatives to oil were available Saudi Arabia would be a non issue in the world and they would go back to being nomadic desert dwellers where they belong. Lets get on with making oil superfluous.
726 2018-08-09 22:35:05 then lets tell them to keep their oil
727 2018-08-09 22:35:04 It seems to me that nearly everyone knows this is a stupid idea. So is his military parade. So is his “wall.”  So is his meeting about “ adoptions.”  There is a reason snake oil salesmen never stayed in one place for very long. Most people can see through the shiny object MO.

729 2018-08-09 22:34:51 Sure they won’t turn down votes, but they don’t seem to be working for them either. They need to work for them. I vote green locally when I can & my prez election vote went green cuz the platform better aligned w/my values re: hc, fracking, oil, money in politics, among others.
730 2018-08-09 22:34:38 Steam them (add a capful of vinegar to the water) then sauté them for a hot second in olive oil and garlic
731 2018-08-09 22:34:31 Haha I got yo back girl! I hope it works for you! They use it a lot in “raindrop” oil therapy if you feel like some research!
732 2018-08-09 22:34:30 We’re suckers to the Oil of Saudi! #Yemen  This is the way of this #beautiful world. It’s horrific, and yet we’ve lived with the horrors of war all of our lives.  #shameontheworldfordoingFUCKALL.
733 2018-08-09 22:34:30 There is no bull case for oil
734 2018-08-09 22:34:23 Currently at @mrlube Vancouver Main & 2nd. When I arrive I'm quoted $105.99 for an oil change. When I ask for the price menu, there is not one single service at that price and the actual price is $74.99. Lordy. #greasy

737 2018-08-09 22:33:46 Get that protien and mosture! Coconut oil great especially if it’s thicker hair.
738 2018-08-09 22:33:41 But they make money from Oil ???
739 2018-08-09 22:33:40 Hmm, I had pegged you as a coconut oil guy.  I mean, I didn't literally peg you ... to be clear.
740 2018-08-09 22:33:39 If you remember some people in China had no heat last winter cuase they couldn't get enough LNG-Saw tonite where India is buying a lot more oil form us and very little from IRAN

742 2018-08-09 22:33:29 I actually prefer Argan Oil for my own hair. Coconut oil makes my scalp itch like crazy
743 2018-08-09 22:33:25 Ai how does the guys in the Scandinavian countries like Norway do it...they gave free education yet have only oil as their resource
744 2018-08-09 22:33:20 Any Nigerian crude oil deals
745 2018-08-09 22:33:13 CBD oil has literally changed my life. its a strain of cannabis with little to no THC so you get all of the pain reliving qualities of medical marijuana but it doesn't get you high. its completely legal in every state. i promise it will help
746 2018-08-09 22:33:02 I live in Holland I can get canabis oil legally here 
Everything that makes you high is taken out and you just get the 
Medicinal oil one or two drops on the tongue  and your done
747 2018-08-09 22:32:53 You can wash it, If it's seasoned well, it wont hurt it at all. "Seasoning" is just polyermized oil, it's bonded to the iron, soap wont hurt it.
748 2018-08-09 22:32:49 Coconut oil for the hair is a must ladies

750 2018-08-09 22:32:45 National raised petrol excise tax 6 times and another 2.5% rise in GST on top of 15%
Whenever cost of crude oil dropped or when the NZD appreciated petrol prices still went up or stayed the same and National didn't do a thing to stop the rort as the cost of living also spiralled
751 2018-08-09 22:32:45 Mr. LaCroix, he knew the parking lot! That ermine-gland oil in here to buzz you all the tasty cream fillin' of life was real
752 2018-08-09 22:32:06 Why buy oil outside Canada? Build pipelines to refineries east. And to export west.
For the benefit of all Canadians... and then the Saudis can go pound sand and compete for markets
753 2018-08-09 22:32:05 I mean it's a dodge lol i just haven't had an oil change in a while
754 2018-08-09 22:31:58 Husband is going old school with a pot of oil on the stove for fries and I am hiding because it makes me super nervous. Hate that our deep fryer is broken. I asked him not to but he “pfffftttt-ed” me. Jerk!
755 2018-08-09 22:31:50 @JustinTrudeau what will be our response to Saudi Arabia's rash choices? 

They are our friends? Alberta has a lot of oil we can sell Canada. Think about it.
756 2018-08-09 22:31:36 Guys I’m watching the DCI prelims right now and it’s in Lucas Oil Stadium and it’s making me really wanna go to the Indy show
757 2018-08-09 22:31:19 For its "10th" anniversary, Lucas Oil has decided to show DCI its appreciation by having half their concession employees go off the clock during the dinner break.
758 2018-08-09 22:31:10 Le facteur 4 CO2 en 2050 preconisé par le GIEC ne semble émouvoir personne. Pourtant le climat n'est pas un sujet anodin pour nos descendants. Pourquoi si peu se mobilisent pour exiger des EPR à la place des centrales à gaz en Europe ? Inconscience ou lâcheté ?

763 2018-08-09 22:30:42 MSM is all ahoy now for pipelines to counter SA oil imports. Never said one damn word when Trudeau was fking up Energy East for Denis Coderre & to save Lib seats in Que. Same when he cancelled Northern Gateway because he didn't want PMSH to get the credit.

764 2018-08-09 22:30:34 Ahh! I know what's happening there.  

So, diesels can run on motor oil.  

A diesels speed is controlled by how much fuel you put in the engine.

Therefore if you get some kind of leak from the oil system into the engine itself, it'll just rev until it eats all its oil or dies.

772 2018-08-09 22:29:44 My one buddy got a degree from a shady university in Wyoming because his marks couldn't get him in anywhere else in the world. Now he is running a division of a large oil co and making much much more than that. Dumb libs.
773 2018-08-09 22:29:38 Wendy under NAFTA the USA has increased trade with Canada by 400 billion a year. Without that protection, you'd be paying about triple for the 5 million barresl of crude oil we sell you a day.
774 2018-08-09 22:29:34 Best way is to start putting pressure on Irving Oil @irvingoil since they are the ones buying Saudi oil in Cda.
775 2018-08-09 22:29:34 Doesn't it seem odd that a country dependent on foreign consumption of oil would purchase an electric car company?
776 2018-08-09 22:29:29 Palm oil is so weird. Like, no other part of the hand has oil? Not even the wrist? Cuticles? There's no knuckle oil?
777 2018-08-09 22:29:23 Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world,

Ripe for aigricultural abundance, 

And has a dynamic culture and history,

Socialism has reduced one of the richest countries in the Western Hemisphere to one whose citizens must eat their own dogs. #SocialismSucks
778 2018-08-09 22:29:00 I hate going to get an oil change or anything dealing with my car bc they always try to play me and ask me questions and try to upsell me !!!
779 2018-08-09 22:28:42 I did level 10 maintenance, mechanics did 20 and above -- fuel and oil checks, and track pad maintenance is all we did--outside of actual gun maintenance. Lol.
780 2018-08-09 22:28:32 That is not how the Saudis deal with receiving the actual hardware. For that part the Saudis buy/pay on delivery. The shipments are in batches as the factory outputs. Payment is on delivery on a per batch basis. Cash, gold, oil, whatever.
781 2018-08-09 22:28:30 BIG OIL!!!!
782 2018-08-09 22:28:27 nothing funnier than a man consuming a literal gallon of cooking oil and then redispersing it across the carpet
783 2018-08-09 22:28:23 Never has a President polluted our science with self-serving politics they way Traitor Trump has.  True, Reagan tried to get away w/calling ketchup a vegetable & said oil rigs off our coast were beautiful.  But Trump is the most evil Nero in his scheming while our planet burns.

788 2018-08-09 22:27:35 Cruz doesn’t have to talk about what He “wants to do”, look to his voting record to see what he has done... removed needless govt regulations to spur job growth, have you seen the oil boom in west Texas? He’s lowered Texan’s taxes, he’s got the ball rolling on removing Ocare
789 2018-08-09 22:27:26 Products? Or oil? Maybe we should become self sufficient and stop trading with countries who don't give women rights
790 2018-08-09 22:27:16 This sums it up:

Saudi: We’re pulling all our citizens, money and investment out of Canada!

Canada: GOOD! Go ahead we don’t want your stinkin blood oil anyways!

Saudi: Oh except oil. You can keep buying that.

Canada: And we will!!

791 2018-08-09 22:27:05 Investing in safe and reliable public transportation is a great idea for several reasons:

1). Increases access to more opportunities for lower-income individuals.
2). Reduces our daily dependence on oil and gas.
3). Attracts and enables businesses.
4). Creates local jobs.
792 2018-08-09 22:26:58 Maybe your jaw needs a little 3 in one oil, or maybe you have TMJ and need to wear a bite splint
793 2018-08-09 22:26:57 the tobacco vanilla perfume oil from @KrazyEssentials smells so amazing. sham has really been killing it with these scents lately. 
794 2018-08-09 22:26:56 I cracked my first oil pan like that (,:

796 2018-08-09 22:26:33 I want my free shit to include bank bailouts, oil subsidies, wars for oil & tax cuts for the already wealthy, NOT health care, education or a job. Libruls r stoopid
797 2018-08-09 22:26:19 Just blew oil smoke in some fiends face lmao idek why 8 I did, no hand outside here cuz
798 2018-08-09 22:26:14 Better oil up the clippers then 
799 2018-08-09 22:26:03 well, I ran over my push mowers fuel cap today & I ran out of oil while mowing with it last week. So this is the summer I’m glad I did get myself a riding mower 
800 2018-08-09 22:25:53 There is some truth to what was said, anti oil, anti fish farm groups receive significant funding from US based groups, fish farming in BC is controversial, but it is evolving to be better environmentally, and employs a lot of people in remote areas
801 2018-08-09 22:25:50 Coconut oil makes for a great lube for jerking off
802 2018-08-09 22:25:49 I’ve been moisturizing with Vitamin E oil for about a year now. It didn’t help with scarring I have but it reduced the appearance of my stretch marks.
803 2018-08-09 22:25:45 Okay, look it up. Bear in mind that Ireland,  Finland, New Zealand etc. Have become wealthy and successful nations without oil and whilst you're at it, also look up Norways (who has less oil than Scotland) oil revenues over the same period. 

Revenues can increase outside of UK.
804 2018-08-09 22:25:34 How about we stop buying there oil and use our own.
805 2018-08-09 22:25:15 Instead of disparaging him based on crap you’ve ingested on Twitter, do a little research.

811 2018-08-09 22:25:01 You don't remember Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Libya, that Obama deported more than Bush supported oil and coal... Shall we continue on about how fucking horrific these parties are or should we break away?

822 2018-08-09 22:24:10 Surely that would be a short book, it just has to say "because some scientists are paid by the oil/gas/coal industries".
823 2018-08-09 22:24:04 keep living ur dream, don't wake up to see ur economy shaking to the ground due oil prices and sanctions pulled by "arab tribes" xD
824 2018-08-09 22:24:03 only makes sense if other countries are REQ’D to let us do things like, put military weapons in their country for OUR protection, send back our arrested citizens on foreign land, send us oil so we can drive cuz trump says renuables = bad. $$ isn’t everything all the time...but ok

828 2018-08-09 22:23:19 Fat bombs with weed infused coconut oil is where it's at. My faves are like Reese's Peanut Butter cups.  1/2 cup each of melted oil, cocoa powder, and peanut butter mixed with 1 tablespoon of Swerve sweetener; pour into silicon mold and refrigerate 
829 2018-08-09 22:23:09 Not having coconut oil is damn near the worst thing that can ever happen
830 2018-08-09 22:23:06 I don't pay attention to engines unless they need an oil change or filter, or a rod is knocking.
831 2018-08-09 22:23:00 America has enough oil stored to run this country for decades without buying Saudi oil,or pumping

834 2018-08-09 22:22:55 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
835 2018-08-09 22:22:54 Canada isn’t in a position to say no.  Not self reliant, so pick your evil country to buy oil from.
836 2018-08-09 22:22:47 I would spend it on a Air Fryer.  Gave up cooking with oil.  So far I lost 25 lbs.
837 2018-08-09 22:22:44 This is important 
In the Tesla fan group they dont understand that 90% of the buyers simply dont want one.

Not big oil 

Just not interested
838 2018-08-09 22:22:42 Republicans use fear while Democrats use intellectually valid discussions. We have a high percentage of uneducated within our population. Con artists, like Trump, sell their snake oil to the uneducated. These uneducated voters will empty their pockets for false security.

846 2018-08-09 22:22:02 Churchill or other British Involved with the rejection of Iran's proposal would likely justify the rejection by asserting that Britain built the Oil Industry of Iran. So, you know, it's theirs. Also Britain had the embargo option, which they knew would be effective. #British
847 2018-08-09 22:21:30 Except for the GOP. Republicans want to trash our beautiful state with fracking and oil pipelines and waste

849 2018-08-09 22:21:08 Being told a child I supplied free cannabis oil to wth a terminal brain tumor has bn told by drs the tumor is still liquefied and dormant. Was given 3 months to live 3yrs ago. She looks and feels amazing #legalisecannabisnow #iamnotacriminal #cannabissaveslives #illegallyhealed
850 2018-08-09 22:21:02 Because he is making a change. Electric cars and renewable energy are disrupting the big oil companies/energy co. My theory: Those companies paying media and politicians to try to stop musk.
851 2018-08-09 22:21:01 Didn't Pierre Trudeau try to do this with his NEP but the western provinces said no and they rather deal with oil companies? lol don't blame the east for pipelines.  This goes way back in 80s where greed overtook national dependency.  Now Canadians are paying the price #karma
852 2018-08-09 22:20:52 Similar to Trump's decision on Iran benefitting Russian Oil?
853 2018-08-09 22:20:48 everyone thinks so actually But people don’t realize I’m the kind of man that carries his girlfriend on his head like government work. You don’t like this person? She’s gone. I should grow beards? I’m buying beard oil.

857 2018-08-09 22:20:23 What’s pissing me off today: Non-vegans bringing up soy consumption. Why, you ask (but even if you don’t, I’ma tell ya)?? I just spent 20 minutes trying to find a loaf of bread that didn’t have soy flour or soybean oil or soy isolate in it. 

P.S. Kroger, you need to do better.
858 2018-08-09 22:20:10 Great read. What drives the Brent-WTI spread always confuses me. Is it the cost of transporting oil from Cushing to the Gulf and than to China or is it stock levels in US vs Europe?
859 2018-08-09 22:20:09 Seriously? I didn't know that. I overheard a witness saying it sounds like a car hydroplaned and struck the other. The road was coated in oil.
860 2018-08-09 22:19:51 I. Hate. Air. Fresheners. And. Diffusers.

I have one myself and I literally use straight up peppermint oil or orange oil. Usually before company is coming over and I feel like I need to have a fresh scent. That’s it. Well and sometimes herbs in the disposal.

Otherwise I die.
861 2018-08-09 22:19:37 Okay...who the fuck is Lucas Oil??
862 2018-08-09 22:19:24 I buy the brand “Eden’s Garden” on amazon but any oil brand you trust should have it as long as it’s 100% pure! It is super blue though so don’t drop it on a white towel you want to stay white like I did 
863 2018-08-09 22:19:22 Y’all actually believe that witch doctor essential oil shit works or does anything?
864 2018-08-09 22:19:01 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
865 2018-08-09 22:18:58 If you are Zimbabwean and you happy with the USA and you down the food chain . My Bro o sister you are the fool . They don't do anything for free , there is always a catch . Look at the middle east when they wanted cheap oil. It became a warzone
866 2018-08-09 22:18:36 I think we should build energ east and proudly tell the Saudis to stuff there barrels of oil where the sun doesn’t shine
867 2018-08-09 22:18:02 境内がコース？？
868 2018-08-09 22:17:54 Kai  with confirm oil
869 2018-08-09 22:17:54 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.

871 2018-08-09 22:17:36 I wonder what future generations will think about The Oil Age.
We need another Renaissance 
#TYTLive
872 2018-08-09 22:17:17 And they also have the turning circle of a North Sea oil tanker which doesn’t help in traffic.
873 2018-08-09 22:17:15 Only trouble... changed starter twice...replaced flywheel once...changed oil every 5000 miles like clockwork
874 2018-08-09 22:17:12 The Koch Brothers Made All Their Money By ROBBING The Osage Indian Tribe of Their Oil Lands. . . “By 1924 There Were At Least 24 Murders Alone of The Osage Indians.”
875 2018-08-09 22:17:09 Chef Kawasaki cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with hot sauce.
876 2018-08-09 22:17:09 Keep eggs & oil same temp and add oil very slowly
877 2018-08-09 22:16:47 Money seems to oil the machinery Tom. Apart from the overt violence of the drug cartels what is it that separates them from the out and out fraudulent activities of big pharma?? And anyone who accepts their money is tainted by association.
878 2018-08-09 22:16:44 Because they're too busy fighting each other....the entire debacle looks like an episode of the new statesman with Rick Mayall when they thought the country was running out of North sea oil
879 2018-08-09 22:16:42 most disheartening discoveries thus far in my adulthood: 
-$400 is not a lot of money
-why is olive oil so expensive
-this whole list is just me not being able to afford stuff
-vanilla extract?
-forget about it
880 2018-08-09 22:16:38 I hate coming to get oil changes
881 2018-08-09 22:16:35 crushed for illumination
oil down our cheeks
mingling with tears and bursting
into flame
882 2018-08-09 22:16:07 Holy shit... I just performed in Lucas Oil
883 2018-08-09 22:16:06 @HeadtoHeadRadio Mississippi State vs Michigan state at Lucas Oil in Indy
884 2018-08-09 22:15:58 Not only can I not see because am fucking blind but I’m also crying and have oil in my eye
885 2018-08-09 22:15:58 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
886 2018-08-09 22:15:51 Wilding...
My child will never go near fire or hot oil at that age
887 2018-08-09 22:15:46 Turban is wound to tight...we are sitting on oil why go to another country.
888 2018-08-09 22:15:44 I have retweeted long ago.
889 2018-08-09 22:15:42 Saudi Arabia is a rogue nation, depending on its oil reserves to quell Western condemnation. Luckily Canada isn't so easily intimidated and is calling them out on their human rights outrages. #TYTLive
890 2018-08-09 22:15:41 Should just buy the oil pan myself! Stopped shopping there once discount rules changed. Cost plus 1.0% was good! Perks of CTDreamin!!
891 2018-08-09 22:15:38 Didn't find oil, then?
892 2018-08-09 22:15:27 I've gotten really into CBD oil to help with my anxiety.  I'm thrilled to say it's working for me #nomorepills #CBDlife
893 2018-08-09 22:15:25 im the bodybuilder of opec. call me oil piggy
894 2018-08-09 22:15:21 Oil money plausible imo, we shall see
895 2018-08-09 22:15:20 Dunn There are used in shit Oil as the sense …).
896 2018-08-09 22:15:17 Why would we continue to buy oil from a country who is not buying our grain, divesting from CDN investments and pulling diplomats and students from our country?
897 2018-08-09 22:15:05 @realDonaldTrump Hey Con Man Don. If this is a witch hunt, then you make me believe there really are witches. Let see. Well respected professional vs a snake oil visceral liar. Acting and looking guilty pal. Embarrassment and divider. Awful for America (AFA). Sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
898 2018-08-09 22:15:02 "...thinking saps brain oil", new phrase to add to my dictionary. Lol
899 2018-08-09 22:14:53 And just like that I have preformed at lucas oil
900 2018-08-09 22:14:50 Easy to find UK veg oil for general cooking & cold pressed rapeseed oil can replace extra virgin olive oil. For bread bake your own sourdough, no yeast needed.
901 2018-08-09 22:14:41 Putin had every reason to want Trump after the annexation of Crimea. They claimed the warm water port they needed for oil exports, were slammed with sanctions, and needed a blackmailed fool to not enforce them. 

Am I missing something?
902 2018-08-09 22:14:39 African black soap R100-150g. R300-1kg. 

Jamaican castor oil R200-100ml.
903 2018-08-09 22:14:38 @cnn @BillWeirCNN fascinating expose on red tide in Fla but surprised no mention of the chemicals used in the NOLA oil spill clean-up. Many fertilizer and phosphate based chemicals dispersed that washed into Fla shores and likely culprits to the red tide epidemic.
904 2018-08-09 22:14:27 From 8¢ (Canntrust)-14¢ (Medreleaf)/mg of CBD oil from licensed producers in Canada.
905 2018-08-09 22:14:20 Hey #cdnpoli does this @Saudi spat even matter, if they keep buying our armoured cars / tanks & we keep buying their oil? @saudi still helps our economy & Canada still helps their's? #allgood #steadyasshegoes
906 2018-08-09 22:14:20 Seriously you’d allow an oil backed state to finance this?
907 2018-08-09 22:14:15 CAP its self relies to some extent on funding from the UAE, otherwise known as oil financing.
908 2018-08-09 22:14:12 Maybe a sale on the horizon? To a rich oil company 
909 2018-08-09 22:14:08 "The nastiest and whitest things in the world cannot be fondled or even cuddled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
910 2018-08-09 22:14:05 Same excuse every time “I had to assist #SaudiArabia or else they’d cut off our oil supply!” #tytlive
911 2018-08-09 22:14:04 That woman (?) looks nothing like a human. There is more resemblance to a perforated oil drum than a happy, fearless human. If she chooses to look that way, good for her but I have the same right to be incredulous at her dress & to laugh & to suspect some mental issue. Don't I?
912 2018-08-09 22:14:03 Butter and olive oil don't mix... (sigh)
913 2018-08-09 22:14:02 This has nothing to do with oil. The current Martian regime is a threat to the entire galaxy.
914 2018-08-09 22:13:58 Mom just made THE best popcorn popped in coconut oil and topped with butter. Wow.
915 2018-08-09 22:13:56 Yes. That’s a Burning oil rig. Leda is African American in this version.
It is a complete twist on the ancient myth
916 2018-08-09 22:13:46 One of the rovers found oil.
917 2018-08-09 22:13:41 now, maybe Irving Oil planned to upgrade its Saint John refinery, but i can't find any reference to such plans
918 2018-08-09 22:13:32 Gone have to postpone for a minute  coming from getting an oil change. It's gone take me an hour to get home lol
919 2018-08-09 22:13:27 So does coconut oil 
920 2018-08-09 22:13:26 Guys just use coconut oil and wet wipes to take off your makeup, it's comes off fast fast
921 2018-08-09 22:13:16 コミケ行ったことないからわからないですね。
922 2018-08-09 22:13:11 Sunscreen be my favorite smell. Who needs tanning oil?
923 2018-08-09 22:13:04 Not really. Climate scientists on the other hand are given government grants and are hailed as public heroes. And your second tweet makes zero sense. Oil companies don't have the power to punish dissenters.
924 2018-08-09 22:12:49 Norway have shitloads of oil and gas - that's why they're prosperous. And, as I said, we can't have the Norway model anyway.
925 2018-08-09 22:12:44 هذي توفره @Oil_organic1
926 2018-08-09 22:12:31 @GOP hides the “free stuff” better in billions of dollars in subsidies to big oil, corporate welfare so WalMart can refuse employees a living wage, double Irish with a Dutch wrapper tax fraud schemes. Amazing how “free stuff” looks different when the wealthy exploit it daily.
927 2018-08-09 22:12:16 This was one of my favorite Maddy scenes that wasn't a foot fetish scene. Loved the oil & sheer pantyhose & the intensity!!
928 2018-08-09 22:12:16 Oh my god these people are paid by oil companies to tell big fat fucking lies about climate change. Wind and solar will REPLACE OIL AS BEST ENERGY, they know it and they fear it. They should be looking for NEW WAYS TO SUPPLY CLEAN ENERGY.
929 2018-08-09 22:12:15 Well, whoever it was at, please ask your local spirit guide for some blue ice skate fish oil. My pineal gland is calcified again from all the fluoride in my water
930 2018-08-09 22:12:07 Hot water with lemon, apply lavender oil on your temples, take deep breath,
931 2018-08-09 22:12:06 Many varieties of bitter orange are used for their essential oil, and are found in perfume, used as a flavoring or as a solvent. The Seville orange variety is used in the production of marmalade.
932 2018-08-09 22:12:03 2018-08-09 17:01:49 | ADMIN GENERAL | OIL CHANGE, COLUMBIANA
933 2018-08-09 22:12:00 So wait, it is ok for America to have an interest in a foreign nations resources as long as that resource is not oil? How does that work exactly?
934 2018-08-09 22:11:55 Good question ....There won’t be any way of producing & distributing solar panels without oil (but I think you probably knew that). 
935 2018-08-09 22:11:41 No. They choose that oil.
936 2018-08-09 22:11:36 With a little elbow grease and snake oil all things are possible through $$...i mean god...fck it, they're one in the same
937 2018-08-09 22:11:33 Do they need to kill the sperm whale to harvest the oil..?
938 2018-08-09 22:11:28 だって、コミケの音系エリアって、えむすりゃーみたいじゃんw
939 2018-08-09 22:11:19 Just paying 30 for full synthetic oil change is pretty amazing life 
940 2018-08-09 22:11:18 I use anointing oil
941 2018-08-09 22:10:46 Why Oil well owners are crying against Buhari government? @nassnigeria @MrAbuSidiq @SaharaReporters @iameneji @ogundamisi @tvcnewsng @APCNigeria
942 2018-08-09 22:10:44 Because it used to be a Democratic Republic and turned socialist. That's why all if the hype about Venezuela. It's a country RICH in oil and it has turned to a mound of asphalt cement. That is what happens to socialist countries. Don't wish for it, we don't want that here.
943 2018-08-09 22:10:41 I’ve been sneak ripping my oil pen and all these people probably think I’m sick as fuck but really I’m just so high
944 2018-08-09 22:10:39 True, never stretch latex after smear it with oil
945 2018-08-09 22:10:24 Also, sorry to interrupt but shoutout to Raquel & her Castor Oil recommendation on InstaStories a few weeks back - my face is glowing & baby’s rears are jealous AF
946 2018-08-09 22:10:21 Oil, candle outside (not inside)
947 2018-08-09 22:10:17 Today I'm serving slouched, comedic, rowdy, buglike sesame oil realness.

950 2018-08-09 22:09:40 Does anyone remember that guy who pumped oil into his arms? Is he still alive or is he not?
951 2018-08-09 22:09:39 Putting the oil in dildo.
952 2018-08-09 22:09:32 “blizzard wants yall to throw balls during summer games not matches” me, in match chat, 2018, oil on canvas
953 2018-08-09 22:09:28 yup might as well go to space..we can send you there..besides you won't help clean up the mess your oil buddies have made of our sweet planet....and let the martians pay for it
954 2018-08-09 22:09:25 受かってるらしい。
955 2018-08-09 22:09:25 I would assume it's out of trade fears! (Oil) the world is held hostage by global trade, precarious to say the least!
956 2018-08-09 22:09:20 We proposed Gas turbines from GE to provide 850 MW in 90 days, the Minister insisted on Barges and Heavy Fuel Oil.claiming we don't have Gas,but he has HFO.We replied both products are imported, and we included gas in our offer to give KWH in 9.5 c Shameful
957 2018-08-09 22:09:18 The best feeling is knowing you can take your car in for an oil change and not come out spending $400+ getting your car fixed 
958 2018-08-09 22:09:16 I didn’t know this existed, thanks for sharing! I’m sure I have something in the oil’ archive I would revise and submit.
959 2018-08-09 22:09:15 You guys know how there’s normally like...bars and restaurants around your favorite sports team’s stadium? Yeah, Lucas Oil Stadium didn’t get the memo that that’s a good thing to do.

961 2018-08-09 22:08:59 There's oil out there and we're going to get it, baby!
962 2018-08-09 22:08:58 1) who knows

2) nah these aren't inoculated at all, they just pick up N-fixing Burkholderia from the env't & give them a good place to live. 

Most of the time, "inoculants" sold for ag are snake oil. The bacteria you want are already out there. Just gotta give them a good home.
963 2018-08-09 22:08:55 They have oil payouts to it's citizens.
964 2018-08-09 22:08:42 Because the weapons we sell them are worth far more than their oil reserves.
965 2018-08-09 22:08:26 私も今回の夏えむすりゃーは辞退(´･ω･ `) 

つか、ちなさん居たの？
966 2018-08-09 22:08:26 Tomato salads with mozzarella, cut up some onion, basil, oregano, olive oil, salt and pepper. You can also use balsamic vinaigrette
967 2018-08-09 22:08:22 Seeing what Qatar, United Arab Emirates do with their oil money makes me wonder what Nigeria and Ghana are selling. coconut oil?
968 2018-08-09 22:08:14 A dose but a taste better with lemon essentially oil
969 2018-08-09 22:08:13 If it makes you feel better about meaningless chatter, please feel free. Now would you support stopping our purchase of KSA oil? That might get their attention. Just asking.....please reply.
970 2018-08-09 22:08:11 As an oil or in what form?
971 2018-08-09 22:08:09 They are an odious government who suppress their own people. Especially women and religious minorities. You note though that they will still sell us oil.
972 2018-08-09 22:07:55 The Bush family is makes money from Oil and The production of arms manufacturers. Did Iraq have nuclear arms? I don't know. But there could have been a reason not to go to war with Iraq. Kennedy was going to take us out of Vietnam and they killed him for it. Johnson kept us there
973 2018-08-09 22:07:51 i swear when i run thru my oil fast i get a feeling that the wax company i copped from skimped me
974 2018-08-09 22:07:20 He can still sell his snake oil out of the back of his horse buggy. Giddiup. But finally Twitter, glad to see you put on your big bird pants!
975 2018-08-09 22:07:19 raga qualcuno sa un fondotinta buono per chi ha la pelle grassa e che sia oil free? Ho fatto un po’ di ricerche ma se ci fosse qualcuno si è trovato bene con qualche prodotto me lo dica graziee
976 2018-08-09 22:07:18 Warm some cooking oil and put some drops inside the eat. .. seal with cotton wool
977 2018-08-09 22:07:12 あとはDNSの待ちだから国際展示場向かっても大丈夫かな？
978 2018-08-09 22:07:10 It's time to drop bombs on Mars and bring democracy. Also we need to take their oil...if you are not with is then you are against the USA. God Bless America.
979 2018-08-09 22:06:58 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
980 2018-08-09 22:06:54 SA supplies Eastern Canada with oil!

Our leaders are ALL utterly visionless.

Eastern Canada, agree to give preference to Alberta oil.

Alberta, it takes 10 YEARs, but build some refinaries and directly sell oil to Canadians.

Canadians, elect people who CAN GET THIS DONE.
981 2018-08-09 22:06:46 I swear by my flaxseed bag when I’m in a lot of pain! It’s essentially a heating pad, just a cloth bag filled with flaxseeds that I heat up in the microwave. It really helps to relieve my pain when nothing else will  also blue emu oil!!!
982 2018-08-09 22:06:41 fair criticism, but in addition to human rights abuses saudi arabia has massive amounts of poverty. perhaps our two nations could help each other out by making poverty obsolete. nationalize and redistribute oil wealth to the mass population instead of 10 billionaires, for example
983 2018-08-09 22:06:35 What I find fascinating is when you first look at the painting it looks like something done a few centuries back . Then you look at the slender woman, not typical model, her hair , the oil rig and you see it’s a modern day painting .
984 2018-08-09 22:06:12 Says some obvious astroturf front funded by oil billionaires.
985 2018-08-09 22:06:06 Plus subsidies given to big oil; absent these, green energy would be far more competitive, and can you imagine if we were to subsidize the greens?
986 2018-08-09 22:06:05 That coconut oil be doing something to me man..
987 2018-08-09 22:05:58 Oooo I have never heard of copaiba oil??
988 2018-08-09 22:05:29 何とか新旧サーバ動き始めました。DNSはやく切り替わってくれ。。。
989 2018-08-09 22:05:21 Why would we take their oil . You can't have it both ways . I hope companies and government dont allow this
990 2018-08-09 22:05:21 There's also the parallels between Sylvannas and Arthas to consider, which have been getting laid on thicker than oil since as far back as Cata and have really taken off with the DK plotlines in Legion.
991 2018-08-09 22:05:12 At the end of the day ALL that matters in a GE is who votes for what party. Crank left or oil slick right who gives an f.....g toss!!! You either vote Labour or you don't. Grow up!!!!
992 2018-08-09 22:05:11 They are still pretty backward over there.  Too bad oil was found on their land. They would still be living in tents.
993 2018-08-09 22:05:10 1. Even if you are for a balance, you should still accept the science.
2. A balance won't be enough and if you understood the extent of the problem, you wouldn't be for a balance.
3. Germany is getting rid of fossil fuels completely. Russian gas(not oil) is just a stepping stone.
994 2018-08-09 22:05:05 ちなさんとnayutaさんにあいさつ周りしたい気持ちはあったけれど、仕事と仕事と暑さには勝てない
995 2018-08-09 22:05:04 Blue Tansy essential oil!! Apply it with a carrier areas of pain and also 15-20 drops into an epson salt bath! It’s an amazing natural anti-inflammatory and has helped my fibromyalgia/chronic pain SO much. And it smells amazing! Just don’t ingest orally! Hope it helps you girl!
996 2018-08-09 22:05:00 so you are telling me that Saudi Arabia attacked its best ally, its greatest friend..and put oil production, future and the whole country into a jeopardy!! that's the most absurd and foolish thing I've ever heard. have you ever thought that it doesn't make sense at all???
997 2018-08-09 22:04:49 Yes. But it's not on point with what I know folks are currently paying for high-quality CBD oil for seizures.
998 2018-08-09 22:04:49 Thank you I'm sure olive oil will do nayo
999 2018-08-09 22:04:16 Get a small carbide drill bit and some cutting oil and drill the screw out
1000 2018-08-09 22:04:15 We got Tang, Jesse. TANG!!!
1001 2018-08-09 22:03:58 Coconut oil is so good for hair and skin... just keep in mind it’s comedogenic so if you get it on your facial skin too much it may cause it to get angry and mountainous!
1002 2018-08-09 22:03:54 U know the bitter truth is the fact we all know various ethnic, religious and co bigotry exist among us but we choose to pretend with the crossing the line chant wen someone is so bold to bring up the topic, the earlier we own up our problems the better.
1003 2018-08-09 22:03:48 What better way to diversify you economy away from oil.  It hits strategic point for Elon and Saudis.  #smart
1004 2018-08-09 22:03:19 This STINKS! Evidently the @CA_Dem party is run by gas and OIL-i-garchs.
1005 2018-08-09 22:02:47 But I love broccoli. Nice and fresh, roasted with olive oil? Not a lot that's better.
1006 2018-08-09 22:02:45 Ok I understand you now lol yea we arent betting our survival but I still wouldnt say unnecessary they still provide fat which can be used for many things(candles, oil wicks, cooking oil etc),can be sold/exchanged for more valuable things.
1007 2018-08-09 22:02:39 Aku pakek bio oil sambil diet. Ngecilin badan. Eh samar alhamdulillah.. :)
1008 2018-08-09 22:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
1009 2018-08-09 22:02:29 Thanks Chris.
cc: @HeidiHenkel One more. Colorado has 7x the oil and gas jobs as PA? Really? Doesn't feel like that's the right multiplier.
1010 2018-08-09 22:02:19 Russians are notoriously pro-environmentalist & are leading the way on Green energy, if by Green energy we’re talking about cash  for oil 
1011 2018-08-09 22:02:14 yet Canada continues to buy Saudi oil. 
1012 2018-08-09 22:02:06 This is definitely a completely different modern take on the Greek mythology with Zeus being dead and an oil rig burning in the background. Survival amongst the destruction of our environment??
1013 2018-08-09 22:01:59 Interesting thing about ketchup, it becomes a lot more fluid when shaken. I forget the name for this but phenomenon but it's used in drilling oil.
1014 2018-08-09 22:01:37 Me:*uses truffle oil & not olive oil* Fuck 

"You can look online to see how to cancel out the taste of truffle oil"

Me: Sweet I can salvage my food

Reads article :

"Chef Gordon Ramsay on the one ingredient you should NOT have in your pantry: Truffle Oil"

Me: Gee thanks 
1015 2018-08-09 22:01:37 I like that i live right by Walmart so i can just come back home when my car is getting an oil change and walk back when it’s ready lol
1016 2018-08-09 22:01:35 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil!?

1019 2018-08-09 22:01:19 Plate (volume II, folio 19) from ADVENTURES IN KU-TA-BA WA-DO
John Edward Steichen
Oil, black without ink
1020 2018-08-09 22:01:19 Why not used truck?

Two years ago we bought 2012 F-350 for $26,000.00 out of Texas oil fields.  90,000 miles out of Warranty, then couldn't keep it out of a Ford repair shop.

Loss 2016......$20,000.00 just in repairs and tires.
1021 2018-08-09 22:01:03 I say stuff. Like when Denise Batters says something racist, I call her a racist. When Pierrre says something douche-baggish, I call him a douche-bag. When Justin Trudeau buys a pipeline I accuse him of sucking on big oil. When he cancels vote reform, I call him an asshole.
1022 2018-08-09 22:01:01 Looks like mine when I put oil
1023 2018-08-09 22:01:00 for nights i've burned the midnight oil waiting for you
for days i've held my hands in prayer wishing for you
and now this post is cheesy as hell but i' glad my wish came true

Happy second @cypgonz 
I love you 
1024 2018-08-09 22:00:57 So I bought this facial oil awhile ago and it smells awful so I haven’t used it I can’t find anyone I can give it too lmaoo
1025 2018-08-09 22:00:55 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
1026 2018-08-09 22:00:54 Norway is a bad example because of the oil wealth.
1027 2018-08-09 22:00:53 Hey Singh, We do not need to import oil. Canada has large reserves, but then again you support the Leap Manifesto, right?

@VassyKapelos 
If you are going to have people like Singh on them you should also have people from oil sector.
1028 2018-08-09 22:00:32 With new pipelines nearing completion in  energy hungry China, in addition to Chinas extraordinary investments in alternative energies (especially solar - they are world leaders), they will soon no longer need our expensive oil. Seriously, it’s over! B.C. can’t even sell LNG.
1029 2018-08-09 22:00:31 No they are not. They have the world by the balls. They own the satellites. The money. The oil. The coal. Healthcare. Food. Water. And control the weather. After all. What happens when you heat up the ionosphere with exciting microwaves. But hell. What do I know.

1032 2018-08-09 22:00:06 Clinton's start the   "Prisions for Profit". Some towns went broke with their snake oil sales. Democrats started the Welfare no father's in the home to get the checks. Causing the absent father's. Causing fatherless kids..causing more criminals to put in jail
1033 2018-08-09 22:00:06 Esse era um trabalho para o grande super herói Oil Man!!!
1034 2018-08-09 22:00:04 2018-08-09 16:47:43 | ADMIN GENERAL | OIL CHANGE, COLUMBIANA
1035 2018-08-09 21:59:51 It's a big money pit, to divert more taxpayers $$ into the pockets of today'a carpetbaggers and RR contract snake oil salesmen.
1036 2018-08-09 21:59:44 Don't want to splurge on oil blotting sheets? Take a thin toilet-paper square and use it to blot excess oil on your T-zone.
1037 2018-08-09 21:59:36 Well yeah if you fund it by setting up a petrostate and then the price of oil collapses
1038 2018-08-09 21:59:32 I only got 2hrs of sleep then I woke up early coz I need to accompany my bro  to Honda Cars Carmona for the change oil. I demand for a trade. Just a cup of coffee please? 
1039 2018-08-09 21:59:29 Right!  Lets pay $70 a barrel for US oil while they pay us $40.  That is Liberal economics!
1040 2018-08-09 21:59:17 Felicidades Presidente. Reconversion de lo ilegal a lo legal. “Standardized Medicinal Grade Cannabis Oil”. Con los impuestos que conlleva. Colombia de puede convertir en el lider global de un industria billonaria. Ya tienen a su pionera @PharmaCieloCol

1045 2018-08-09 21:58:25 Engaging their addiction to oil. How Progressive.
1046 2018-08-09 21:58:17 And no striker of any significance. Stay In denial. Overall I think your starting 11 this season will be weaker. No stadium on the horizon, just oil money keeping you afloat.
1047 2018-08-09 21:58:13 I use my conditioner as leave in. I actually have olive oil but I don’t use holds much.
1048 2018-08-09 21:58:06 Fucking bitch the oil popped on my fucking hand 
1049 2018-08-09 21:58:04 When will 'oil spill' and 'smokescreen' be implemented?
1050 2018-08-09 21:58:02 Wow... women can drive! But you still throw them in jail when they think!

Best case scenario, KSA/Canada cuts off your oil shipments and we never buy another drop of oil from you again.
1051 2018-08-09 21:57:55 おめでとうございます！！
1052 2018-08-09 21:57:49 Why *don't* we want to steal their oil?  We steal from everyone else, but them we sell weapons to & turn a blind eye over 9/11?
1053 2018-08-09 21:57:43 きょーこりん

1056 2018-08-09 21:57:18 I could not give a rats ass if milo or jones are banned or not.  They are both people playing characters selling snake oil.  The dangerous ones are the idiots who worship at their alter
1057 2018-08-09 21:57:07 So if sale of oil unaffected by this dispute, by the same token do our grain farmers assume Saudi threats to cut off Canada was just a bluff??
1058 2018-08-09 21:57:00 Y'all better stan parrots too.
Our tropical friends want to live in the rainforest so don't eat any kind of food with palm oil or fruits like Avocado
1059 2018-08-09 21:56:58 someone asked me what highlighter i’m using today. 

it’s sweat & oil. lol.
1060 2018-08-09 21:56:53 They believe in it. They want it to melt the ice caps so they can get oil drilling equipment through.
1061 2018-08-09 21:56:50 May I ask where you procure your almond oil? My son grows stronger by the day
1062 2018-08-09 21:56:47 Muskrat uses one-time oil money to create renewsble energy supply for future generations. We'll all be cold in the ground when the kids of 2118 will be nice and affordably warm from an asset that is long paid off. Or should we just leave them debt and nothing else?
1063 2018-08-09 21:56:36 just make sure you are clothed in white and your lamps are filled with oil,because darkness is coming when no on will be able to work
1064 2018-08-09 21:56:36 Believe Saudi shipments of oil to NS refinery are bought & paid for three months in advance.
1065 2018-08-09 21:56:33 Defeatist attitude? You misunderstood my reply. I was simply stating economic facts. 

Did you miss that I ended my message with a positive idea that we have an opportunity to succeed in alternative energies? Oil is a dying business... albeit, dying too slow but it’s finite.
1066 2018-08-09 21:56:32 India needs Oil and is spending massively to build their infrastructure. It would be beneficial for Canada. Only problem is the Canadian federal government which is sympathetic to Khalistani separatist in Canada.
1067 2018-08-09 21:56:30 Ano gamit mo @MomshieArts ako nag try ng oil of olay now
1068 2018-08-09 21:56:19 Yes again agree with what you have opined but cad usually is the canary in the coalmine for $ strength or weakness.. Usually moves first before others and I dont think a move of those proportions would be based on Oil alone.
1069 2018-08-09 21:55:52 Maybe add a daily moisturizer/leave in, a natural oil and a shine/hold mist.
1070 2018-08-09 21:55:35 同期が一足先に盆休み。
初日からオールしたという一報有り。
楽しそーだなー

さて、仕事行こ。
1071 2018-08-09 21:55:27 The small bird yes. Didn’t realize it was covered in oil. A contemporary myth?
1072 2018-08-09 21:55:27 If a Veyron didn't cost two orders of magnitude more than the oil change, then yes it would make more sense
1073 2018-08-09 21:55:17 Agreed. Removed future steady income from oil and gas (mining and agriculture too) and added additional liabilities like free fees, PI donations, regional slush funds etc  to  the already tight balance sheet. Now its not balancing, wonder why.
1074 2018-08-09 21:55:10 Reason #286 why my parents’ house sucks: who the fuck buys a tub of MARGARINE to put on toast and shit?! It’s 80% vegetable oil! Nasty! It’s called “bread and butter” NOT “bread and margarine.”
1075 2018-08-09 21:55:08 We were all told that Mexico is going to pay for the Wall, have we forgotten the mantra at his campaign rallies. The snake oil salesman strike again, a bunch of jackasses
1076 2018-08-09 21:55:07 Yoga is usually my go to but if that hurts, focusing on deep breathing and slathering myself in copaiba oil as well as a chiropractic visit. People have suggested acupuncture to me, though I haven't ever tried it myself. If all else fails, sleep.
1077 2018-08-09 21:54:46 Why are we going to space if we can't prove there is oil there? Is there Vicodin on Mars? Otherwise not sure why Trumpkins would enlist.
1078 2018-08-09 21:54:18 Realize that the "old money" rich have run this country for a long time, they have all of their assets in the original industries, coal, oil, and timber. As the worlds attitude changed and technology began to make these obsolete they saw a future they couldn't abide, being "poor"
1079 2018-08-09 21:54:07 now I'm adding that to my mental images of the problems of impotence, the spiky purple thing you just posted and the bacon grease, butter and vat of corn oil 
I think it might be time for me to switch off ,
1080 2018-08-09 21:53:32 We’re do you think the Americans get there gas and oil. Not from the rag heads
1081 2018-08-09 21:53:31 I work with hydrovacs, illegal dumping? They are just unloading water+ dirt usually. Normally do  it in the field where daylighting occurs. Were they using the vac to suck up oil?

1084 2018-08-09 21:53:08 i accidentally took half of my eyelash extensions off with an oil makeup wipe that i thought was oil free so now i need to go get a fill and i barely have any time to shop for the things i need and pack for puerto vallarta tomorrow :)))))
1085 2018-08-09 21:53:06 Is he a president or a fucking priest?
Redemption? New beginning?
This level of bullshit used to only be reserved for snake oil salesmen and evangelical faith healers.
1086 2018-08-09 21:52:58 Aaaah, I don’t understand why every spurs fan doesn’t feel like this. We’ve had the best time of anyone last 4-8 years, done it organically without oil money, I wouldn’t swap it for anything
1087 2018-08-09 21:52:52 Don't Fuck with MURIC...
This is Nigeria
1088 2018-08-09 21:52:42 Leada and the Sawan...know the story?? 
The Swan is the father. Leda is the woman. Leda was the mother. That’s an oil rig burning in the distance. See the bird covered in oil?
1089 2018-08-09 21:52:31 Thank God I'm already selling coconut oil o 
1090 2018-08-09 21:52:25 What a rollercoaster $tsla ....from blatant lies on balance sheet and on cc, Saudi oil money buying stock, Elon pumping a buyout rumor, insanity

1092 2018-08-09 21:52:11 I save my rendered fat from most of my meat (mostly bacon and beef) and reuse it as often as I can for cooking.  Otherwise it’s olive oil and coconut oil for me too.
1093 2018-08-09 21:52:04 savings are up from 2016 which is when oil tanked
1094 2018-08-09 21:52:01 Now I know why plagiarism is a sin!
Content development takes critical thinking and thinking saps brain oil.
1095 2018-08-09 21:51:56 I have this exact thing !  I hasten to add that its also not got anything to do with the uses of corn oil .
1096 2018-08-09 21:51:54 I use to love coconut oil, then I started sleeping on it.. I started buying it again and now I'm mad I slept on it in the first place 
1097 2018-08-09 21:51:48 Damn bro gotta be careful, that’s when it’s the most dangerous when it starts raining and the oil from the roads mixing and can cause a car to slide
1098 2018-08-09 21:51:40 Falz would have passed his message without offending peoples faith,and promoting ethnic profiling,there are lines you don't cross,this is the simple truth ,look at it from that angle.
1099 2018-08-09 21:51:40 It’s weird to me we have to pay for all medical treatment via insurance because of these inflated rates. When I get my car’s oil changed I don’t use car insurance. Why do I have to pay for medical care with insurance or pay a much higher price?
1100 2018-08-09 21:51:27 Coconut oil it up 
1101 2018-08-09 21:51:02 Old snowblower guy and his friend came for my old mower that stopped working. They asked if they could take mine cuz he had another wheel that'd fit better. They brought it back with been wheels, an oil change & new air filter wonder if they do cars?
1102 2018-08-09 21:51:00 Why are we buying oil from SA and exporting ours??
1103 2018-08-09 21:50:56 @Trader_Moni when is activation going to happen in the Eastern Markets like Main market Onitsha, Ariria Aba, Ogbete Main Market, Oil mill market PH
1104 2018-08-09 21:50:53 A game called “qifane” here we all write down a name and i wrote down olive oil heuheu
1105 2018-08-09 21:50:42 “Mars awaits”…. Mars awaits what? Space marines? That one’s all red…and there’re trees. Red. Trees. Do these dipshits think there are forests full of space-oil-hoarding Star Muslims? Islamic Space Infiltration Legion? Terrorist training camps on Acidalia Plantitia?
1106 2018-08-09 21:50:40 He's done very well out of drizzling olive oil..
1107 2018-08-09 21:50:37 I stole Randy’s tea tree oil and just got like $50 worf of new products from innisfree I’m goina take mi skin to a whole new level
1108 2018-08-09 21:50:32 CanadaA doesn’t buy oil.  Private businesses buy oil. 
Canadian business can help get Canadian oil to market to minimize oil imports. 
If we build pipelines. (Which Mr Singh opposes)
1109 2018-08-09 21:50:30 I performed in Lucas Oil Stadium. This is unreal.
1110 2018-08-09 21:50:05 @JustinTrudeau @CFRAOttawa Listening to @brianlilley filling in today for @billcarrolltalk and he and Ian Lee are talking about exactly what came to me yesterday! Build an east-west pipeline stat and then actually walk the walk: stop buying SA oil. Otherwise, stop grandstanding!
1111 2018-08-09 21:50:00 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1112 2018-08-09 21:49:55 bro it’s cheaper if you buy the oil itself and then go to the mechanics to change it out, spent only $100 for it
1113 2018-08-09 21:49:41 They're being muffled by oil & money.
1114 2018-08-09 21:49:41 Soon California will be free of the axis of oil. No more hard earned CA dollars for Saudis, Russians or Texans.
1115 2018-08-09 21:49:35 Phew, little hot out ... felt half-baked, when I can back from dog walk but now, with an ice coffee and peppermint oil cooling my legs, I’m in heaven or close to it ... and the writing continues #heat #coffee #peppermintoil #mynxlife
1116 2018-08-09 21:49:31 Who says you need a highlighter when you've got natural oil on face
1117 2018-08-09 21:49:28 Looks like lunchbox needs some coconut oil 
1118 2018-08-09 21:49:18 < #油song の曲目から、中の人が主に誰のペンか想像がつくと思います…ふふっ
1119 2018-08-09 21:49:10 Coconut oil really be moisturizing y’all skin and hair ? Cus it don’t do nothing for me . Olive oil tho >
1120 2018-08-09 21:49:05 So glad you featured at least one oil from Peloponnesus. In Greece, Cretan oils are considered better for cooking, Peloponnesus oils, especially around south, where Sparta is located, could be the tastiest olive oil for raw consumption.
1121 2018-08-09 21:48:55 Already thought about those but previous statements vehemently against Oil interests seem to disqualify them. Or not...
1122 2018-08-09 21:48:40 Aromatherapy Tip of the Day: Put one drop of Lime essential oil in your sunhat on a hot day. Refreshing.
#57aromas #aromatherapytip #limeessentialoil #aromatherapy
1123 2018-08-09 21:48:40 Can’t help but wonder if the Iran situation was created to take their oil off the market and throw price support etc at domestic producers
1124 2018-08-09 21:48:36 Working superbly....but an Oil play rather than $ IMO.....not seeing Oil/$ as the usual inverse play for a while, Oil has its own agenda right now I think
1125 2018-08-09 21:48:29 それ使うくらいなら阿鼻叫喚のアエギにしろ
1126 2018-08-09 21:48:29 I like how a destroyed oil rig gets lower story billing than a bikini contest
1127 2018-08-09 21:48:24 I was sincere...I would give him full marks if he banned Saudi Oil...I truly would..but we all know the Irving family who profits off Saudi Oil and basically owns the Liberal party would never allow that.....
1128 2018-08-09 21:48:17 So I can scream .. curse .. degrade .. and spout ridiculous conspiracy theories .. while blaming everything on conservatives .. big oil .. the banks .. and deranged conspiracy bloggers?
1129 2018-08-09 21:47:49 1章と野獣関係ないだろ死ね
1130 2018-08-09 21:47:49 Not to state the obvious, but no matter republican or centrist Dem, the Saudis are our friends no matter what they do. Oil is thicker than blood (or principles [principles LOL]), although one always seems to lead to the other.
1131 2018-08-09 21:47:47 Someone invent an oil change+weed store #zerogiven
1132 2018-08-09 21:47:45 “The oil of the Holy Spirit is poured upon the Church at particular times for a reason. … It is the call of God to every believer to collect enough oil of the Spirit in order that we will be able to continue to burn brightly as the world fades into darkness.” —Richard Riss
1133 2018-08-09 21:47:42 Not really. Startch, oil, msg
1134 2018-08-09 21:47:19 i underestimated the power of tanning oil and now i think 500 layers of my skin burned off
1135 2018-08-09 21:47:17 @Maxxyproski get over here & see how you could explore this. I know you sell great coconut oil
1136 2018-08-09 21:46:47 I'm no fan of monopolies, but comparing it to standard oil is a stretch.  Imagine bitmain controlling the shipping, the communications, the credit finance, the silicon suppliers and all factories.  That'd be standard oil.
1137 2018-08-09 21:46:36 @realDonaldTrump  Why is Niki Haley standing on border of Venezuela  with propaganda. Do you need more children? Several countries have starving children but Venezuela has the richest oil reserves! hello............Well, I guess you want healthy looking kids, like Venezuelan!
1138 2018-08-09 21:46:26 I love this, and seeing good on Twitter instead of our Twit-in-chief. What I would like to do is get them out of harm's way, and only put them there when absolutely necessary. Never for oil, or profit. Thank you for all you do. May you be pumped on your 100th Birthday, and beyond
1139 2018-08-09 21:46:18 Our need for oil and gas in the UK helped this happen
1140 2018-08-09 21:46:15 As a household products company, we sometimes use synthetic ingredients because it's a more environmentally responsible choice. For example, palm oil can lead to deforestation if not harvested sustainably. Other times, natural may be a great choice. Hope that helps clarify.
1141 2018-08-09 21:46:13 A drop of pure and natural extra virgin olive oil is an amazing moisturizer for your skin and won’t clog pores!
1142 2018-08-09 21:46:11 Hahahaha I mean you CAN do it that way  I love watercolor/gouache for fast stuff but it def dries fast and if you go over it too many times, you peel off the paint layers lol. Oil you can mix directly on the canvas/paper!
1143 2018-08-09 21:46:05 Even if we were backed by the gold standard, we would still want oil sold in dollars no?
1144 2018-08-09 21:46:04 Transport klingt irgendwie wie Oil Wrestling.

I mean, what's a few years in comparison to you being bio-mass for a human species in a million years who decided that oil is a great resource for energy.
1147 2018-08-09 21:45:45 My beard oil is vanilla sandalwood.

My beard oil is as basic bitch as beards get.
1148 2018-08-09 21:45:36 it’s the COCONUT OIL
1149 2018-08-09 21:45:29 Same. Also, managed to get all of the ascension material. Now to grind for oil in part 2 because I drained the part 1 shop of fires and blazes.
1150 2018-08-09 21:45:11 My son’s Cress & Tracker have been rough housing for hours. They’ll no doubt demand i rub them down with almond oil later and make them steaks
1151 2018-08-09 21:44:54 Canada needs to fully develop its oil industry and markets for domestic and export and drop all US and Saudi Oil.
1152 2018-08-09 21:44:49 KINGS OF INFO: MEDIUM OIL USING THOUGHTLESS FLUORIDATED TOOTHPASTE TO CONTROL HUMAN OR ALIEN!?!?!
1153 2018-08-09 21:44:44 @miguelitolemuel FaceTimed me and he was telling me how to make chorizo properly and he got like visibly mad when I pulled out my Spanish organic Estate Grown & Bottled Cold Pressed  extra virgin olive oil from Trader Joe’s :\

1156 2018-08-09 21:44:23 82% of USA middle class think you have too much MONEY now.We don't need you to bring back asbestos. ..mine the whole country..coal gas. Oil...
1157 2018-08-09 21:44:18 Guhhhh. This bitch need tires, air cabinet filter, seats need cleaning, oil change 
1158 2018-08-09 21:44:16 But that's different: Eastern Canada is almost totally dependent on imported oil so it gets a pass. But Western Canada is almost totally dependent on oil exports to USA so its access to offshore markets via @TransMtn gets blocked by enviros. Is that fair? No!! It's madness.
1159 2018-08-09 21:44:14 And am I correct to think that the label "Product of Italy" does not necessarily mean that the olives/oil are grown in Italy; only that the oil was bottled there? Despite some reading, I'm not at all certain. That, of course, is a separate issue from land use & farming practices.

1161 2018-08-09 21:44:03 I'm getting an oil change and the guy said I looked "tired" and gave me a discount. 
1162 2018-08-09 21:44:03 Try with supplementing Vitamin C if you're into this stuff, it can help overall and especially with the radiations you get while flying. Best one is liposomal, which gets insta-absorbed. I would also recommend magnesium oil to improve sleep. Not medical advice ;)
1163 2018-08-09 21:43:43 Vitamin E oil is wonderful for dry chapped lips. Use in place of a chap stick or lip balm.
1164 2018-08-09 21:43:39 I believe it is the tax cuts for 1%ers, stripping protections for workers,  giving oil & mining rights to plunder public lands & on & on.

1169 2018-08-09 21:42:44 Babe, honestly I wish you would try Blue Emu Oil. Emu oil has many benefits and has been used by aborigines for centuries. This WILL help!
1170 2018-08-09 21:42:42 Every western democracy needs to have their own energy strategy to stop buying oil from Saudi. They have two things to control the world oil, and the two most valuable religious sites to Muslims. They know oil sales are going to slow so now they export Islam.

1174 2018-08-09 21:42:08 I bathe in corn oil daily, add it to my tea & coffee, cook everything in it,  use it as a flavoring, sometimes I even treat myself to a pint of it instead of beer,  and it often replacest he red wine on the table - even the cats get it . lovely jubbley.

1184 2018-08-09 21:41:09 We’ve been distracted for decades about the evil relationship between the US & Saudi Arabia that exists purely for the control of the price & flow of oil. The war in Yemen could be de-escalated if not stopped by ending US participation & full US diplomatic pressure on Saudi’s.
1185 2018-08-09 21:41:01 Tea tree oil is so strong, it’s overpowering my perfume today 
1186 2018-08-09 21:41:01 i'll post abt one more that surprised me that @CNBC is reporting abt: that #oil has been suffering 6 weeks of declining value, last i knew oil values were booming, but its so easy to miss these swings.
1187 2018-08-09 21:40:59 If y’all tryna grow ya beard put castor oil on it worried about putting pussy on y’all face 
1188 2018-08-09 21:40:43 @Saudi_Aramco your govt has overstepped, keep your morally dirty oil, we have more than enough.
1189 2018-08-09 21:40:39 There is a new refinery in Alberta that is half functional that can refine tarsands crude. It is only functioning at 1.3rd capacity as yet. Soon, even ships won't be able to use our oil as the sulphur content is too high for new International shipping regulations.
1190 2018-08-09 21:40:34 i found prescribed xanax and lavender essential oil in my make-up bag and i feel like that is something that essentially sums up my life

1195 2018-08-09 21:40:12 I’m not convinced. I think spraying oil would kill many insects and spiders.

1198 2018-08-09 21:39:56 Exactly. Snake oil to vulnerable people who are desperate. It’s despicable.
1199 2018-08-09 21:39:48 Fox News Anchors know that when DonaldTrump abolishes a crucial regulation, Paul Ryan silently prays for help #resist
1200 2018-08-09 21:39:41 Your oil is beautiful. We’ve been showing it around here for you. Lovely balanced oil xx
1201 2018-08-09 21:39:05 good..we don't want there money and there oil..also shut down any Mosque
that is sponsored by  the Saudis
1202 2018-08-09 21:38:54 Why do we keep revisiting the same mistake?

The Saudis are NOT our friends. They are an awful, radical regime.

Meanwhile, our stupidity is creating new generations of people who (rightfully in many cases) hate us.

All for oil? Greed? Both?
1203 2018-08-09 21:38:51 FTR: my mother showed me how to change a tire. Had to learn that plus how to check the oil and tire pressure in order to drive when I got my license. #NoSkillsNoKeys
1204 2018-08-09 21:38:49 My favorite part of today was bringing my car in for an oil change and picking it up with a $440 bill because everything was wrong with it

1208 2018-08-09 21:38:18 No. I own an electric car and ride my bike. Plastics don't contribute to #climatechange. The pipeline WILL - it will add 2 700 000 cars worth of emissions every year it operates. And our oil is not used by Canadians. It's too dirty and we don't have the refineries.
1209 2018-08-09 21:38:18 Some girl came into giant eagle and said "Where is, shit you gotta nice ass for a white girl! wheres the cooking oil?"

1211 2018-08-09 21:38:10 For soup, cook sliced leek in oil, then simmer with chicken, rosemary, beef broth and black beans. Top with tarragon.
1212 2018-08-09 21:37:54 You are very amazingly funny .. now Saudi Arabia would go to your shore to steal gas and oil and uranium lmao .. it is the other way around dumbass it is you who have pirates all over the sea and terrorize the ships and steal .. cause that is the only thing you are good for
1213 2018-08-09 21:37:46 CBD oil drops directly under the tongue!

wtf? how about from Canada?

1218 2018-08-09 21:36:43 I'm for a balance, so we aren't dependant on foreign sources. Look at Germany's need for Russian oil.

Not your standard olive oil. C'mon now.

1226 2018-08-09 21:35:35 I am not the one claiming I need to detox. 

Shall we discuss the raw materials that went into producing your phone or computer. Crude oil (possibly fracked oil), lead (smelted), mercury, maybe a bit of gold. Right....it only matters if it matters to you. 

Chemtrail trigger?
1227 2018-08-09 21:35:35 Shut off Saudi Oil.
1228 2018-08-09 21:35:31 Not convinced this is an advertorial however does leave some concerns unanswered regarding the possible environmental impact of increased Palm Oil production to date... never mind it's sustainability going forward. Re-planting is good but not if jungle was replaced to do so.
1229 2018-08-09 21:35:28 Dunkirk's on. The sequence where Farrier is coming around to take on the bomber as the wee boat is grabbing men out of the oil filled water is still tense as hell.

1232 2018-08-09 21:35:15 It was not about oil.  You are quite the conspiracy theorist, aren't you.  Geez!
1233 2018-08-09 21:34:56 At least it will be an ideology instead that ,,,hole saying (we fighting an ideology),,,,,,,,,dick did sign all our oil contracts before war(you know my ideology towards that),,
1234 2018-08-09 21:34:43 Which oil are you talking about 
1235 2018-08-09 21:34:40 Easy to make mayo: into cylindrical container, put 3 yolks. Juice of a lemon. Tsp of Dijon mustard. Season (I like garlic/onion salt). Pour in 1 cup of light olive oil. Use immersion stick-blender to blend for 20 seconds from bottom. Lift stick slowly continuing to blend. Mayo!

1237 2018-08-09 21:34:34 Zach sounds like he has a police record, changes oil for a living and makes child support payments to multiple single moms
1238 2018-08-09 21:34:33 I did some research and apparently people use coconut oil etc too. It’s brill because it gives you a clean finish and no cuts... watch out, legs are out 
1239 2018-08-09 21:34:30 Fake news. Wake up, sheeple! Who gains most from Alex Jones being banned from these platforms? Alex Jones. Because he can play his crybaby "I'm a victim" card and get idiots to buy more of his snake oil nonsense.
1240 2018-08-09 21:34:26 An event that enabled the American-Anglo backed Iranian coup d'etat of 1953 was the AIOC's refusal of Mosaddegh's proposed 50/50 partnership. The previous relevant agreement, known as the D'Arcy oil concession, provided Iran with 16%. #operationajax #cia #sis
1241 2018-08-09 21:34:22 I'm smart enough to see you're rather emotional right now so I'll chalk that "implication" to the nerves. 
Again, I don't see where did he threaten to hack you but I'm pretty sure last thing you need is more "oil" to the fire. 
So I'll wish you best in fixing this.
1242 2018-08-09 21:34:20 Yep so much winning for the Rich, the Russians , people against The environment( oil companies) lets drill in Alaska for  oil so big business can make more money. The racists who are against minorities , immigrants of any kind. . What a great legacy Trump

1247 2018-08-09 21:33:59 But Trudeau said he wants to phase out oil.
1248 2018-08-09 21:33:55 Has CBD oil helped anyone with anxiety, sleep problems, bipolar, chronic pain or autism? I need help with all of these things bit have severe reactions to most meds and can't take pain meds at all for my spine issues. Is CBD a good option to consider? Any negative side effects?

1260 2018-08-09 21:32:56 Possibly CBL oil?
1261 2018-08-09 21:32:54 it's oil
1262 2018-08-09 21:32:46 Yeah, by looting kurd's oil or by funding ISIS to get oil? 15 years are a good no.. Yes, Political instability causes economic growth to suffer which brings us to the point that; was all the mess (in terms of economy, social fabric) for putting Imran in that seat really worth it?
1263 2018-08-09 21:32:44 I came for an oil change and they’re really trying to give me a job 
1264 2018-08-09 21:32:37 Canada has no need to purchase oil.  Refine our oil in our country. Not only does it provide good paying jobs but it ends our reliance on foreign nations.
1265 2018-08-09 21:32:33 The 1ml vials never have enough in them. And even if they do contain 1ml, it's impossible to draw all of the oil when it's at the bottom of a vial with the needle at a higher level.
1266 2018-08-09 21:32:23 The reforms they are making are essentially about diversification of the economy so that they are not quite so dependent on oil income. The rest of it is for Western consumption.

1269 2018-08-09 21:32:06 If this is anything like the climate scientist @jclement4maine  who was reassigned from working with rural villages Alaska to an oil and gas revenues office in Oklahoma...(with Zinke overheard saying the intention was to get climate scientists to quit), then my guess is bad news!
1270 2018-08-09 21:31:58 Right. More tyrant oil. Brilliant.
1271 2018-08-09 21:31:34 Ever try CBD oil? Not a miracle by any means, but it helps me. Just too expensive.
1272 2018-08-09 21:31:33 Hey 1890s citizen, if you don't like buying oil from Standard Oil, go start your own oil company.
1273 2018-08-09 21:31:33 He sold them military material and buys their oil. Trudeau stands for nothing.

1285 2018-08-09 21:30:16 Hoy hable con el gerente de un ypf directo, me dijo q las privadas no refinan xq a este valor no les conviene, ypf sigue con sus cant habituales y no hay gas oil suficiente para el campo ni transporte ¿Habrá corte de rutas o subirá el precio del combustible?la dejo a tu criterio
1286 2018-08-09 21:30:04 Just responded to a Oil Of Olay BG commercial on CN. I put in the response “ Are you crazy I’m a Noxema man myself
1287 2018-08-09 21:29:58 Wd-40 is not a lubricant.  Soap is also only temporary.  3-in-1 oil, or graphite, or lithium grease will likely do the trick.
1288 2018-08-09 21:29:53 Easy allergy and sinus headache relief. Put locally made honey in your morning tea or coffee and lavender oil in your bath. Find more natural stress remedies on our blog.
1289 2018-08-09 21:29:52 my skin is read and itchy and im ignorant and think it helps putting on oil like it wont make my skin break out more
1290 2018-08-09 21:29:52 Simon Cowell left American Idol, Earthquake in Haiti, Saints BountyGate, Kobe won his last championship, Eminem released Recovery, The Walking Dead premiered, BP Oil Spill, Shaun White won a gold medal, and in the fall me and you entered 8th grade.
1291 2018-08-09 21:29:42 sautee big portobello mushroom heads in a pan with olive oil and put it on a bun with toppings just like a burger but no meat and a super good sauce to use for that is spicy aoili sauce which is like 4 ingredients super easy to make! there are recipes for the sauce online
1292 2018-08-09 21:29:39  Eisha honestly, this stuff is revolutionary!! I’ve never shaved my legs with oil before, I am a new woman 
1293 2018-08-09 21:29:38 We should stop buying their oil , everything, we supply them with has been shut down or called back , so a little fu@k it , Saudi , you have soft shoulders, keep your oil, and no produce made with Canadian grains , on your shelf’s,
1294 2018-08-09 21:29:21 These guys are priceless - they pull everything that puts $ into Can out - but - will readily ship oil for Cdn $. What hypocrites. Smarten up Canada, oil will be used for a long time and we have it to use if pm would get his act together and do what's best for us
1295 2018-08-09 21:29:20 今回初日は行きませんけど自身そっち側の人種ですし今日だけですから、夏の風物詩として微笑ましく受け取ってます。ただ、客観的に見てやはり身だしなみは整えようぜとちょっと思いますねせめてそのシワだらけのシャツぐらいは…

1297 2018-08-09 21:29:14 You’re further proving your racism. Anyways yall are illegally fishing on our shores, taking uranium,oil & natural gas. Ive never went to any country illegally & we are going back  to help. Besides Saudi Arabia isnt exactly heaven on earth. Even refugees are fleeing there
1298 2018-08-09 21:29:08 Mum’s showing me how to whiten my teeth with coconut oil and we can’t stop giggling at each other 
1299 2018-08-09 21:29:01 They shut off our grain... shut off there oil..
1300 2018-08-09 21:28:57 Allways remember to check vintage lenses before buying. Check for fungus and dust inside the lens and be sure the blades is not full of oil... happy hunting for great vintage lenses for your mirrorless camera ;-) #vintage #mirrorless #fungus #nooil #huntforvintagelenses

1302 2018-08-09 21:28:28 As a confirmed olive addict I am headed in to @TheOliveOilTapr to stock up on my favorite; the hand stuffed Gordal olives! They are finally back in stock. They are extremely addictive: red chili, green, almond, orange, lemon & garlic. #olive #oil #RVA
1303 2018-08-09 21:28:15 Years ago reviewer likened watching a particular movie to rolling down a marble staircase in an oil barrel: loud, dark and not even a little bit fun. I unapologetically love that description. Embrace it
1304 2018-08-09 21:28:12 Just because a dick gets a taste heaven changing the oil in your Porsche don't mean you gotta make it copilot, does it!
1305 2018-08-09 21:28:08 Without oil and gas who would care what happens in Libya
1306 2018-08-09 21:27:59 Just as long as we don't find space oil, we're good.
1307 2018-08-09 21:27:54 They are also using their oil money to kill fellow Arab brothers in Yemen !!!!
1308 2018-08-09 21:27:48 An anti-Big Oil company getting bailed out by the biggest of Big Oil would be the most ironic thing ever. $tsla #tesla
1309 2018-08-09 21:27:47 I just KNOW gps has contract with oil & gas companies as much as they make you go the wrong longggg wayyyy 
1310 2018-08-09 21:27:42 This black seed oil really suppresses your appetite. Wow.
1311 2018-08-09 21:27:29 Hot bath with baby oil an exfoliating gloves comes off sooo easy x
1312 2018-08-09 21:27:28 Unless you'd find oil on Mars
1313 2018-08-09 21:27:26 And in one vote you ruined all your so-called work and ANWR along w the world because once all that permafrost is defrosted due to acceleration from oil drilling our world will heat up even worse.
1314 2018-08-09 21:27:04 but just think of all the space oil and space jesus you could find up there! 
1315 2018-08-09 21:26:52 $60 for a fuckin oil change  this mf better last the rest of the year
1316 2018-08-09 21:26:50 Wickens was running great today! That rookie mechanic should be promoted for tuning such a good car today!
1317 2018-08-09 21:26:49 I drove a 9axle and ran cranes in the oil/gas patch for over 20 years. Nice rig
1318 2018-08-09 21:26:44 i've only done one tiny oil painting in my life but i have an idea for a big 4-piece mixed media series partially in oil so that's happening i guess
1319 2018-08-09 21:26:37 Plus a severe olive oil shortage in Anatolia, leaving the lamps very dry indeed.
1320 2018-08-09 21:26:34 He’s not the canary in the coal mine you think he is . He’s a grifter and a snake oil salesman , he’s an opportunist who still has plenty of platforms at his disposal . He was also saying shit that threatened the sites he was on with legal action . Defamation and slander.
1321 2018-08-09 21:26:20 了解です
1322 2018-08-09 21:26:16 Some olive oil in the water.
1323 2018-08-09 21:26:16 Close the window? If it doesnt help ask them to close theirs if you absolutely have to. Otherwise; helpful tip: essential oil mixed with some water in a spray bottle works like a charm; better than regular air freshener bc some molecule shit i cant remember rn
1324 2018-08-09 21:26:08 Depends what kinda oil!
1325 2018-08-09 21:26:06 If they do Indy2 they will keep their fish and oil but return Trident to Plymouth?
1326 2018-08-09 21:26:06 I just did what the box said: Melt a bag of 10 oz. marshmallows with 3 TBS of butter. Mix that with 6 cups of Rice Krispies. Spray a 13x9 pan with oil and then spread the mixture in there. Put in fridge for it to harden a bit, cut & serve! 
1327 2018-08-09 21:26:00 now that stick your foot in mouth pissed off the Saudis the East May have to look West for oil & gas.
1328 2018-08-09 21:25:59 I have to be up so fucken early tomorrow to go get a damn oil change 
1329 2018-08-09 21:25:50 Vai que os veneno concentra tudo no caldin

1334 2018-08-09 21:25:05 @BusinessAdv Horizon Oil investors see wealth destruction as PNG moves to take away their prime resource, the Stanley Gas field. The sovereign risk grows in PNG
1335 2018-08-09 21:25:04 Se n pudesse beber o caldo n poderia comer o noodles
1336 2018-08-09 21:24:56 No matter how mattifying and oil free your foundation is .... it’s all about your skin care and primer beforehand.
1337 2018-08-09 21:24:53 They scared this will encourage us to further develop our own oil resources; would also cut into _their_ markets and prices; which would be a major backfire.
1338 2018-08-09 21:24:50 This is red dead. Not GTA 6. Pump your last gen brakes and get an oil change
1339 2018-08-09 21:24:31 I kind of jus eyeball it. I don’t like a gooey scrub; so I tend to add more brown sugar than coconut oil. But I wanna say I do like 4 tablespoons of sugar and 2 table spoons of the coconut oil.
1340 2018-08-09 21:24:22 If Trudeau said no to Saudi Oil or selling LAV I would give Trudeau credit. So far he tweets tough but is happy to keep buying dirty Saudi oil and sell tanks that will end up causing the very problems Trudeau attempts to care about.
1341 2018-08-09 21:24:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i started crying over pizza please let the speed of hoshido bathe or
1342 2018-08-09 21:24:05 ... and if high speed rail becomes a reality in the US, how will the oil.companies who own the politicians remain so fabulously rich....
1343 2018-08-09 21:24:02 Castor oil is a super outdated method of inducing labor & its actually really dangerous for baby!
1344 2018-08-09 21:23:53 Gold payment for oil is nascent gold remonetization.

Holders of JGBs must look at that abused currency as least attractive in face of sound money restart. Money printing as 'wealth creation' ends when gold cycles (and paper #gold suppression ended by physical #petrogold demand).
1345 2018-08-09 21:23:51 The artists who did the oil paintings at Gen Con sold their pieces for between $4-600 - very reasonable. May not be an original from a card but maybe see if artists have anything available at a Con/GP?
1346 2018-08-09 21:23:46 It is time to get in to @TheOliveOilTapr because their beauty line of 100% extra virgin olive oil has expanded & the ever popular soothing balm is back in stock. Fantastic products for irritated skin whether sunburn, psoriasis or chapped. Love these products! #RVA
1347 2018-08-09 21:23:37 I dunno. Saudis look like paper tigers in a lot of ways here. They kicked up a huge fuss, cancelled everything except the defence contracts and oil sales (i.e. everything really important). The biggest losers would seem to be Saudi students and the Cdn schools banking on them.
1348 2018-08-09 21:23:31 Being one of #SouthernCameroonians who had to leave my homeland to study medicine elsewhere because of no English University despite the fact that oil was exploited from my region, i find your reply very provocative. I am very angry right now. Don't provoke me further 
1349 2018-08-09 21:23:17 Drink cold milk, it gets rid of the capsaicin oil in your mouth. Water can’t. And DONT RUB YOUR EYES for at least 24 hours LOL in other news your veins and arteries are feeling great!
1350 2018-08-09 21:23:15 The world leaders do especially oil companies  like the one the rothschilds own ... ever wonder who tells the president what to do? Wonder why people just bow down and except lil ass pay because Americans are pussies and they let themselves get bossed around stand up forfreedom
1351 2018-08-09 21:23:13 Me sinto melhor agora
1352 2018-08-09 21:23:01 “That does not mean the United States will no longer buy foreign oil or energy commodities. It means the United States will sell more oil and energy products overseas than it imports.”

So @GovMikeHuckabee has no idea what he’s talking about. 
1353 2018-08-09 21:22:51 I'm trying to run out the rest of the oil but don't want to run out before I move at the end of the month!
1354 2018-08-09 21:22:49 Oil
1355 2018-08-09 21:22:48 Aha. Yes, that does prove more difficult. Well, literally any vegetable tastes good roasted with olive oil, salt, and lemon.  Good luck!
1356 2018-08-09 21:22:43 Put the whole Ghana country in oil rice
1357 2018-08-09 21:22:37 How much coconut oil do you usually do? Like what’s the ratio you do?
1358 2018-08-09 21:22:32 My main ingredient is coconut  oil  not a secret if u know me I use it from head to toe. Even to whiten teeth 
1359 2018-08-09 21:22:20 Heat some oil in a pan, fry for approx 7 minutes on each side, until Nicky browned.  Check they are cooked through and enjoy!!
1360 2018-08-09 21:22:20 No, I'm stating a point of fact. Green energy is as much an industry as the oil business.
1361 2018-08-09 21:22:19 Don't give up. Keep fighting. You are still a warrior.
You don't say what your injuries are, but I would tell you it can't hurt to try CBD oil. It's amazing stuff.
1362 2018-08-09 21:22:04 And even the Juul is modeled from the PAX loose leaf/ oil vapourizer. Need to keep up.
1363 2018-08-09 21:21:48 Saudi Arabia spread terrorism,have spread Wahhabism ,have a dreadful human rights record,have caused trouble in Qatar,have pummeled Yemen for years & now they are bombing children on school buses...but it's ok...they have lots of oil & buy lots of weapons from the west
1364 2018-08-09 21:21:34 But you can't ignore concerns from North Burnaby either, given it will be the ones holding almost 30 oil storage tanks on Burnaby Mountain
1365 2018-08-09 21:21:33 I mix brown sugar with coconut oil for a DIY body scrub and it leaves me soooo smooth and it smells amazing. You can also substitute it with coffee. Helps get all the dead skin off!
1366 2018-08-09 21:21:28 There’s absolutely nothing better than gettin a hot shower gettin into bed with no bra tits out face oil applied an a pair of granny knickers on
1367 2018-08-09 21:21:28 Neutrogena has a nice sesame seed body oil that is A-MAZ-ING!!!
1368 2018-08-09 21:21:27 Because that's the oil that grease politicians.
1369 2018-08-09 21:21:15 Update: The vent fire at an industrial manufacturing plant started in an oil mist filter box that got too hot. Fire was contained to the box and the vent system. The fire was extinguished, no injuries were reported and all PCFD units have cleared from the scene.
1370 2018-08-09 21:21:10 A face oil in Jordan costs 23jds in turkey it only costs 7jds WTFFFFGGFF
1371 2018-08-09 21:21:06 Castor oil is great jus don’t put too much on it or your hair will start falling out literally
1372 2018-08-09 21:21:05 Who do you think built it Oil?
1373 2018-08-09 21:20:56 You're sorted then if you ever need your chimney swept, or someone to oil running machinery :)
1374 2018-08-09 21:20:52 UK company, UK oil so please bring it back to UK exchange. Your announced big boy investors on ASX are not doing anything ...

1376 2018-08-09 21:20:46 My birth mother took a table spoon of castor oil and she was in labor a few hour later
1377 2018-08-09 21:20:36 Never tried air frying before but want to know how the food tastes?without oil? Any one?
1378 2018-08-09 21:20:30 Space Force: Mars Awaits. So we can blow it the fuck up and take all their oil.
1379 2018-08-09 21:20:15 SA: Dont disrespect us Canada, don’t meddle with our countries business.WAIT - you know what? F you guys. We’re cancelling our biz deals with you and pulling our kids from your schools. We’re done here. 
Canada: uhhh what’s happening 
SA: WANNA BUY SOME OIL

1381 2018-08-09 21:20:09 I’ve felt so sweaty and ugly this whole week and last night I slept with coconut oil in and wore a low cut shirt today and slapped on some lipstick and I really feel like Beyoncé rn
1382 2018-08-09 21:19:53 Claro q pode pq n poderia
1383 2018-08-09 21:19:38 Sindh receives royalty worth Rs100 billion for oil and gas in ten districts, but there is no accountability, but bad governance, poor education system, roads bridges, and public transport.
1384 2018-08-09 21:19:34 Yes please 
We have Tolo beef rice ,coconut oil  rice, butter rice and vegetable oil rice.
1385 2018-08-09 21:19:32 Net exporter, yet still the price of oil as a whole affects anyone who uses oil or refinery products. Meaning, if the oil supply outside the US has a disruption, US consumers still suffer. No oil use means less pain. So while your statement is true, it doesn’t contradict mine.
1386 2018-08-09 21:19:31 Through experience good RNS do not normally happen on Friday, so probably next week now if not later.
1387 2018-08-09 21:19:26 I'm SURE Jakeleh will be EVER so fair:

@jimgeraghty
1388 2018-08-09 21:19:23 He is only going to move if he wins. He thinks we should buy oil elsewhere instead of providing Canadian jobs by developing/consuming and selling our own. Sure hope Burnaby has more brains then he gives them credit for
1389 2018-08-09 21:19:14 Ooooo I lovvvve rose hip oil!!
1390 2018-08-09 21:19:07 Only my dad would go to the dealer to get my car’s oil changed and walk out with a deal to potentially trade in my car for a another one.

1393 2018-08-09 21:18:33 Dearest mother  I have received your care package of salted sparrow knuckles, dried  skunk bites and, of course, squirrel oil. The unit will begin its march  tomorrow to confront the Hawks of the Sea. I will finally see  battlefield action. Do not fret. I will be cautious.Andrew
1394 2018-08-09 21:18:31 Is the US energy independent?

One portion of the U.S. energy system — the portion that runs on renewables, nuclear, coal, and natural gas — is energy independent. But the transportation system is still dependent on oil, and the United States imports a significant portion of oil

1396 2018-08-09 21:18:23 Today, I let a white man cut my hair for the first time in my life. He did a solid job. I have three complaints: He didn't have any alcohol to wipe my hairline or any oil sheen, no one was there selling food, and country music was playing the whole time
1397 2018-08-09 21:18:15 Awareness that you have no history and are a bunch of rich oil farmers?
1398 2018-08-09 21:18:08 The key is never roast pork chops. You can roast pork loin roasts and pork shoulders etc. Not pork chops. You cook it like a steak. Season up like a steak. Lightly flour. Medium hot  pan with a bit of oil. It should sizzle. Leave on don't touch for about 2 to 3 minutes then flip.
1399 2018-08-09 21:18:06 The dipstick is not touching the oil.... not a full quart low like Donald or Stephen Miller... but low.
1400 2018-08-09 21:18:04 I'm sorry if I think Erdogan dealing money for arms to ISIS through shady oil deals is worse. 

Gulen could be a crook, but you are going to have to do more than send me pics and # tags to do it.
1401 2018-08-09 21:18:01 Where the fuck did this check go?? Nah screw that where’s my gammas oil field cause I’m one of 36 grandkids ?
1402 2018-08-09 21:17:53 Skin overproduces oil when it's dried out. Whatever you've been doing has been drying out your skin
1403 2018-08-09 21:17:47 No eggs/ rice/ oil? Make some egg fried rice
1404 2018-08-09 21:17:38 The way some girls does act when they see men with nice car yuh could swear they mother   breastfeed them  with engine oil 
1405 2018-08-09 21:17:26 I’m about to throw hot oil at one of my co workers
1406 2018-08-09 21:17:24 @HolstaT it takes 13 minutes longer in the morning to properly wash dry oil balm then cement clay my beard it costs a lot more than shaving.
1407 2018-08-09 21:17:23 I feel like non-Oklahomans look at Oklahoma and think all we care about is Jesus, oil, cows, and football. I, an Oklahoman born and raised, also feel like those non-Oklahomans are 100% correct.
1408 2018-08-09 21:17:07 Coconut oil!!
1409 2018-08-09 21:17:06 First, I would have raised him right, up to and including not using motor oil for his hair.
1410 2018-08-09 21:17:01 sure  it makes your house smell nasty and gets oil everywhere
1411 2018-08-09 21:16:55 It's probably dehydrated. Might sound counterproductive but actually works, you need to put oil on your face. Maybe before you cleanse or  after moisturizing? Also do several rounds of patting water into your skin and follow with hyaluronic acid & a good moisturizer.
1412 2018-08-09 21:16:54 why do people call them "dabs?" its OIL
1413 2018-08-09 21:16:51 My oil?? Lol no i made it with 10%!!!
1414 2018-08-09 21:16:42 the D&D ruleset is just a selfish piece of flank steak marinating in some oil on both accounts
1415 2018-08-09 21:16:41 I can then discuss how a local oil spill from a pipeline has ruined an entire neighborhood, and the home owners still deal with the after effects even after the “cleanup” has been completed.
1416 2018-08-09 21:16:29 Case Number 12S47: Responded to noise complaint at 3:07 am at 11 Maple Court. Terrance Merkle was found singing loudly to Cher while rubbing himself with good olive oil. He asked if we had any sea salt, but we did not. He was permitted to carry on.
1417 2018-08-09 21:16:26 Incorrect. He would kick this test in the neck, possibly while covered with motor oil.
1418 2018-08-09 21:16:26 Example: Hard right leaning friend shuts down at mention of climate change. But what we both can agree on is that fracking from gas and oil extraction causes people in local rural communities to have polluted groundwater, poisoning children and ruining lives.

1421 2018-08-09 21:16:09 spinach, burrata, and bone marrow nachos. . .15
harvest grouper grilled cheese. . .7
harvest salmon of the day. . .6
corn olive oil. . .8
1422 2018-08-09 21:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but you and your family.
1423 2018-08-09 21:16:02 I saw this earlier and was like “I literally spend £10 a week max on food when I’m at uni.” Like yeah you’ll have to buy herbs and oils at the start but how long do they last? Like I literally bought oil once last academic year and had my herbs/spices since the year before.
1424 2018-08-09 21:15:51 Why would Canada take Saudi oil? This world is ridiculous! We don't have enough oil in North America? Saudi Arabia wants to cut trade with Canada then stop taking their oil! Our government always sucks. We can't refine and ship our own oil? That would make a few jobs.
1425 2018-08-09 21:15:32 Just had to slather Mike's arms and neck with baby oil so the sweat bees would leave him alone while he cuts wood.
1426 2018-08-09 21:15:32 Re: firefighting foam in taranaki streams: 'And also in the region, oil company Shell admitted it had been using the foam – which was banned 12 years ago, up until March of this year.'

so we fined the shit out of them and closed all locations where this occurred, right?
1427 2018-08-09 21:15:06 Jaws is awesome. Hard to belive he spent 18 months in a shelter after being rescued from a vat of oil.
1428 2018-08-09 21:15:05 @CRBenavidesJ no es hora que consideren otras opciones? Como darle luz verde a la concesión petrolera congela a Mallon Oil? O vender activos? RECOPE me parece una primera excelente opción para la venta...
1429 2018-08-09 21:15:02 Mudkip oil!
1430 2018-08-09 21:14:54 The first one from left (Jordanian) is my favorite one. Mixing it with olive oil makes it yummy 
1431 2018-08-09 21:14:49 Nah, this is wrong. Saudi Arabia isn’t threatened by a nation that can’t build pipelines to transport oil. But Canada should refuse Saudi oil, kick out Saudi officials, refuse to deal with them, etc to make a point of its own. Kicking Canada around comes with consequences.
1432 2018-08-09 21:14:23 Ok. So it is ok for a person to sell snake oil as long it is available only with voluntary donations.  Check.   We should tell that to all the people scammed by nonprofit organizations.
1433 2018-08-09 21:14:21 There’s no oil on the moon though, or is there 
1434 2018-08-09 21:14:19 Oh no don’t talk about Human Rights violations America will get the same over the top treatment Canada has.... oh wait no it won’t since they need America to continue arming them and buying oil (btw Canada stoped our arms deal shortly thereafter the “human rights”  mess started)
1435 2018-08-09 21:14:01 Ontario does not have any oil but it has an abundance of water. @FordNation please review our agreement with Nestle.  Water is one our  most precious & important resources.

NO water no life for Canadians .. Peace & God Bless @CandiceMalcolm @MichelleRempel @lraitt @AndrewScheer
1436 2018-08-09 21:13:56 Crisco? Corn oil?  Holy moly.
1437 2018-08-09 21:13:54 Me: "Look! I took a delicate strip of meat & smoked it for an hour w/olive oil & garlic cloves. Then I mashed the garlic, minced the meat, stirred it together & smoked it for another hour. It'll be perfect in the BBQ sauce!"
The Missus: "No. It won't." (Pulls out spoon)
1438 2018-08-09 21:13:53 It'd be cool if you there was an alchemy mechanic in RDR2 so you could con people as a moustachio-twirling snake oil salesman
1439 2018-08-09 21:13:52 I like calling it a shock to us self esteem. A new oil/economic crisis wouldn’t be a shock to the west’s self esteem but it could again unleash powerful forces. You already saw that post ‘08 with the occupy movement. I think back then we didn’t quite know what we wanted,now we do
1440 2018-08-09 21:13:26 @djadvicer10 happy fm is loud and clear here at Benab oil Kasoa...am enjoying the convo .champions #SM4lyf #TheReignAlbum
1441 2018-08-09 21:13:24 Will the PG have the guts to call out Wagner’s lies about education!  This slob resembles the failure Rick Saccone more every day!  Too many free meals from the gas and oil lobby!!  Shameful!
1442 2018-08-09 21:13:24 No one wants Americans nation dead but my people are angry of your governments. In past centuries they just make war in Middle East to get oil and its money and for that every day they have an excuse for their action read the history of the Middle East u find out the truth
1443 2018-08-09 21:13:17 DONALD, as I've mentioned in some of My previous tweets, Saving Time and Energy is an Essential Principle. WE assume Iraq as a Strategic Interest to the U.S. (Strategic Position, Oil Reserves). WE assume and advise that up to 14 Bln USD to be additionally transferred ...

1445 2018-08-09 21:13:13 Saudi Crude doesn't have shit on Moon Oil
1446 2018-08-09 21:13:11 Saudi Arabia has kicked out the Canadian ambassador, plans to pull out thousands of students and medical patients from Canada and is suspending Saudi state airline flights to Toronto .... but they will still allow us to buy their oil. Well we all knew it was only ever about greed
1447 2018-08-09 21:13:01 It's pouring & I'm down here having to get an damn oil change.
1448 2018-08-09 21:12:57 Who is going to build new refineries for heavy oil and bitumen? If that was profitable, we would already have them. #pnpcbc
1449 2018-08-09 21:12:38 Coconut oil + sesame oil + palm kernel nut oil + shea butter stays winning. 
1450 2018-08-09 21:12:32 Hamuna oil or any help to them
1451 2018-08-09 21:12:28 Most of it is priced on perceived demand.  When oil prices are depressed refineries fill their storage tanks to capacity!  When the summer driving season begins they always find a way to raise prices!  The market lets them do this year after year.  Freezing prices a non-starter!
1452 2018-08-09 21:12:26 Emotional talks with my mum tonight. We fight like cat & dog, clash like oil and water but boy do I love her 
1453 2018-08-09 21:12:07 I need my oil changed while im at work
1454 2018-08-09 21:12:05 Still don't understand why we don't look to alternate sources to import oil?Iran or we need Trump approval.
1455 2018-08-09 21:12:04 Ted supported your tax scam bill? Does he own his own jet or is he drilling for oil in the Arctic? Wait, he probably has an offshore bank account and needs to repatriate his money at 8%, not like the rest of us paying 12%, 22%, or 32%. The above are part of the tax scam bill.
1456 2018-08-09 21:12:00 FACT: In the Permian Basin, oil and gas companies partnered with the National Fish & Wildlife Foundation to commit to conservation efforts! #PermianPower

1458 2018-08-09 21:11:39 America must've found oil in space
1459 2018-08-09 21:11:28 What does jag meet think about BCs oil and gas industry then , he seems to always gloss over their own massive industry .
1460 2018-08-09 21:11:22 Daniel and syntax is like water and oil they don't mix.
1461 2018-08-09 21:11:18 Bought a ginger and mint body oil...super refreshing
1462 2018-08-09 21:11:16 In current National Energy Guarantee #NEG some of our biggest most profitable corporations, like oil and gas companies, will NOT have to follow the same rules as everyone else in their emission reduction targets. This will increase the cost of electricity to everyone. #auspol
1463 2018-08-09 21:11:13 ATTENTION:  BIG OIL WANTS TO DESTROY ELECTRIC/ ALT FUEL CARS.   FOR A LONG TIME NOW.   REMEMBER BUSH SHREDDING EVO ELECTRIC CARS?
1464 2018-08-09 21:11:10 Next, the seasoning oil.
1465 2018-08-09 21:11:03 The oil they take gets exported.
I'm not a Saudi fan. They were behind 9-11, pay Kushner and T***p and are currently committing genocide in Yemen. Their laws about women are atrocious. They just jailed tons of people for not being a big enough kissass to their leader. Not a fan.

1467 2018-08-09 21:10:52 Mr Lammy is little more than the twenty-first century version of a snake oil salesman. Were he not able to wangle himself a Labour rotten borough by playing the one ace he eternally holds up his sleeve thanks to his peripatetic father he would have made a fine estate agent
1468 2018-08-09 21:10:47 I used tinned! I got mine from Nature’s Charm. They actually marinade it in olive oil and thyme - so tasty 

Bit of a nightmare to find in supermarkets all though I’ve heard Sainsbury’s sell it? 
1469 2018-08-09 21:10:46 I don't doubt it, we're actually extremely similar, even fanbases. I would welcome our board pissing off and getting some Arab oil money in - it's the only way to really win anything in this modern game anyway.
1470 2018-08-09 21:10:44 I forze then thawed the tofu for a meaty texture. press it LOTS. Crumble it, don't cut it. I fry it w/ mostly olive oil & a bit of sesame oil, then add sesame seeds to toast
After frying i add Teriyaki sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, tiny bit of soy sauce. Mix & eat w/ rice!
1471 2018-08-09 21:10:34 Dumpster claims his beautiful wall has started.  Replacement of existing fence?  Great wall lol.  Snake oil and lies are his specialty!  Would love to see you visit the beautiful Pacific Northwest!

1473 2018-08-09 21:10:20 IGR per capita is what is stated in that table. The monthly 13% oil derivation of Akwa Ibom is more than the total money Edo gets in a month.
1474 2018-08-09 21:10:16 How can u criticize a country for human rights abuses then continue to enrich them with oil imports. Our PM needs to grow up and cancel all such imports.

1477 2018-08-09 21:09:49 Anyone tried Kratom? I heard Kratom Red Horn is good for pain?  My doctor even said it might be beneficial ...also BDL(?) oil is suppose to be great...I’d really like to try these two
1478 2018-08-09 21:09:45 My name is Alyssa, and I should be Practicing Piano™ for my cousin's wedding next week, but I just spent 2 1/2 hours at the Toyota dealership getting my oil changed, and would rather be sleeping. Stay tuned to see if I learn this freakin song in time
1479 2018-08-09 21:09:38 $CVSI continues to be the market leader and 800 pound gorilla in the CBD Oil space
$CANB is at .015 with a float of 80M, revenues doubling from Q1 to Q2, selling a full line of CBD products in 125

Much higher % gain upside in $CANB with $3M market cap
1480 2018-08-09 21:09:35 It was never the case in his labour days when he played to the gallery or wore expensive Italian shoes. But oil money does wonders.

1482 2018-08-09 21:09:24 Yes, and like oil some of us are more crude than others and need more refinement.
1483 2018-08-09 21:09:22 Really?
1484 2018-08-09 21:09:21 Is there such thing as using the right amount of olive oil when cooking?
1485 2018-08-09 21:09:02 My fave facial routine is oils. Currently loving apricot oil. It's vegan, cruelty free, relatively cheap and cleans so much smeg off. Satisfying!!
1486 2018-08-09 21:08:55 今日は良い日になりますよ〜

1487 2018-08-09 21:08:37 The sooner we all tesla our privates, the sooner we can all stop relying on the big oil companies.

1489 2018-08-09 21:08:14 They will when we find some space oil that needs liberation
1490 2018-08-09 21:08:13 When I visited Sevilla a few years back, they had a tiny 400ft long street that had about two dozen shops. Each one had a niche: olive oil shop, bread shop, wine shop, shoe shop, etc. Each one was 150-500sqft. I loved it. I wish we had that, but I think code doesn't allow it.
1491 2018-08-09 21:08:05 the world should hang its head in shame today...killing children is not on are we happy that the UK and USA put oil and arms before the lives of the innocent....what a vile world we then live in hang our heads in shame 
1492 2018-08-09 21:08:04 I agree never said we should shut down Oil we just need to start using less RFN a lot of this country is on fire, rivers are drying up, canot go out side my house for smoke in Calgary third summer in a row. #ClimateChange is fucking real
1493 2018-08-09 21:07:59 I remember when Okocha was forming loyalty to Bolton. Once Allardyce saw oil money, he agreed deal behind my guy's back & binned him. That's the game. You look out for yourself first. My own issue is with players making promises then doing the opposite. Just don't make promises.
1494 2018-08-09 21:07:57 One of my most painful memories was when I was opening with Tanner, his second shift back. The oil didn't stop dispensing and we didn't notice until it overflowed. It was terrible.
1495 2018-08-09 21:07:55 Uncle Sam Cereal, with Flax-Seed. Guaranteed!!~  Flax Seed = Linseed, which has Oil and Fiber used to make Linoleum, and House-Paints back in the day. You still can mix Linseed-Oil with Bee's-Wax and Turpentine, & whip it up, for an 'Antique-Restoring Material.'~
1496 2018-08-09 21:07:40 I’m guessing this has something to do with oil being found on mars?
1497 2018-08-09 21:07:38 i’ll try tea tree oil again but it stopped doing anything for me a while back... maybe it’ll work now that it’s been a while  thank u <3
1498 2018-08-09 21:07:36 Mentally, you're not right. 

You still wanting to extract every last drop of oil from the North Sea?

Total hypocrite, if you do.
1499 2018-08-09 21:07:29 Why not acknowledge the corruption via Tripoli and corrupt UN appointed government is a failure? Why not just state the corrupt #UN will keep these men in position in #Tripoli? Why constantly attack #Barqah?  Ohh got to remember, it is the oil and gas!
1500 2018-08-09 21:07:17 And 0 progress... guess it’s more birthing ball bounces and time to break out the evening primrose oil.
1501 2018-08-09 21:07:15 We get our full share of north sea oil revenues allocated on a GEOGRAPHICAL basis. If you think there is evidence we are diddled do you not find it strange that ONLY the cybernats like yourself seem to have clocked this? Its never been raised by the SNP?
1502 2018-08-09 21:07:15 INVADE MARS AND KEEP THE OIL!
1503 2018-08-09 21:07:11 Fair play to Canada for standing up to Saudi Arabia regarding their abominable human rights. What they're doing in Yemen is truly heartbreaking. But that's alright cos we've got our arms deal off them an they flood the world with their wealth and oil.
1504 2018-08-09 21:06:59 full engerlish for dinner tonite. been thinkin about it all day. will be the 2nd of the day. fryed in lard an lard only. none of this vegtabal oil shit. set it on table. grab can of carling. panic. dinner gone. dogs face covered in hp sauce. booted it in to neybors garden. fumin
1505 2018-08-09 21:06:50 Well you’re certainly MBS’s toady! It’s already come out that Baird is compromised by his extensive business ties to KSA. And then KSA, for all it rhetoric, states that they still want to sell Canada oil!!! If I was Trudeau, I’d make sure we buy Qatari oil and teach MBS a lesson.
1506 2018-08-09 21:06:47 The Saudis have been buddies and mended fences with Putin since 2000. The Russians are in on the 9/11 job and they had to be in order to recover from the Cold War!! They excelled after 9/11 because the Saudis and Russia control the oil!! Hello!! No one put this one together!!!
1507 2018-08-09 21:06:44 I need my tires rotated & an oil change :/ & I need to get my brakes looked at... just gonna wait for my dad to come in town
1508 2018-08-09 21:06:37 Yeah so I’m making mint-basil lemonade. Mashing the lemons in the sugar to infuse it with the lemon oil from the peel. Got a couple of handfuls of herbs. Yay! Might redeem this day after all
1509 2018-08-09 21:06:32 Nothing to do with free speech no matter how loud or long you try and spin that. Hopefully next on the radar is the FDA investigating your snake oil products.
1510 2018-08-09 21:06:23 Tea tree oil helps repeal mosquitoes, I’m allergic to off so I use that
1511 2018-08-09 21:06:12 It seems hotter in Edmonton than in past summers. I'm guessing we're slowly going to grill to death all over the world. @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer But what do politicians care? Gotta get the oil moving @OilGasCanada Climate change? Not a problem. @RachelNotley @jkenney Until...
1512 2018-08-09 21:06:04 Ssshh Stacey; it's our oil rich 'friends' who are bombarding the poorest Country in the region. 

Nothing to see here.
1513 2018-08-09 21:06:01 Bruh I took so much pain killer and my aunt gave me some weed oil or some shit and I’m high af right now trying to take these kids to get some food 
1514 2018-08-09 21:05:59 I gotta do another fucking cleanse tomorrow because I didn’t do the first one correctly apparently. My thrush came back with a vengeance. I’m gonna ingest fuck load of coconut oil to kickstart the die-off. I’m not fucking around this time.
1515 2018-08-09 21:05:38 Canada is not expecting Trump to defend its ally. Saudi's funded 9/11 and provided the hijackers so I find it mind boggling that USA supports Saudi's. Apparently money and oil trump allies
1516 2018-08-09 21:05:26 I been hip to coconut oil forever now but this new shit y'all dropped is something serious
1517 2018-08-09 21:05:23 girl just dilute some alcohol, tea tree oil, or soap water

1519 2018-08-09 21:05:16 Lmao a lot of them be getting braids too so that makes it worse. My cousin suggested protective styles with no tension and keep them oiled. She used wild growth oil.
1520 2018-08-09 21:05:10 Coconut oil!
1521 2018-08-09 21:05:05 Wow she is clueless... you don’t write a check for tax cuts? Taxes with 65% being paid by the top 1% pay for Medicare, most minorities or underprivileged already go to school for free?? She’s selling a lot of snake oil
1522 2018-08-09 21:04:58 Here u come lmao how was the motor oil fried chicken ? Lmao
1523 2018-08-09 21:04:33 I came to get an oil change and I’m falling asleep 
1524 2018-08-09 21:04:22 Apparently, as a woman, walking out of the store with a case of oil makes you a badass.
Thanks guys?
1525 2018-08-09 21:04:21 @jiffylube It would awesome if your guys spent as much time changing my oil as they did standing around shooting the shit. #nosenseofurgency
1526 2018-08-09 21:04:16 Have y’all tried CBD oil? If so, tell me about it
1527 2018-08-09 21:04:11 I eat loads of oily fish. Mind you it's the oil that I fry it in
1528 2018-08-09 21:03:50 I used soy oil because I haven't gone to Costco. And I want to die
1529 2018-08-09 21:03:41 I don’t feel like going and getting an oil change! 
1530 2018-08-09 21:03:39 Rough fucking day laughed to much at shit luck for someone and fucking Karma bits again.  Nozzle stopped up and flipped the handle....damn thang blew so much tack oil on my pant leg it looked like a cumshot after holding off for a week!

1532 2018-08-09 21:03:34 I need supervision when I go shopping. I went in for 3 things: a shower head, fish oil pills, and bananas. I emerged from the store with 5 full Wal-Mart bags 
1533 2018-08-09 21:03:25 Agreed.  I've only ever seen Teslas plugged into them.  Its a heavily tax subsidized luxury vehicle.
One in my town has "NO OIL" as a vanity plate, complete unaware that our electricity comes from an oil burning plant.
1534 2018-08-09 21:03:12 Well he certainly is not going to defend us seeing as he has business ties with Saudi's. It is weird that USA supports Saudi bc they funded 9/11 and provided the hijackers. I guess money and oil win at the end of the day
1535 2018-08-09 21:03:01 I agree with all of the above.
May I add, that in this situation it is very important for Canadians to stand together.
Peter McKay case in point on P and P. 
Imho, the Saudi reaction has several factors: Saudi relnshp with USA, Saudi loss of face being called out on HR and oil.
1536 2018-08-09 21:02:55 Lookup RSO, as in Rick Simpson Oil. It’s cured people with stage 4 cancer and a month to live. Other people have improved upon the RSO recipe.
1537 2018-08-09 21:02:47 So they will yank their students but keep selling us oil? Gotta admire the Saudis; they know it's all about the money.
1538 2018-08-09 21:02:27 im up here taking notes! hell i already use coconut oil but I might need to get what he's selling bc lawd hammercy that skin is just silky 
1539 2018-08-09 21:02:26 Sunnis except for the Eastern (Gulf) Provinces, where most of the oil and gas reserves are.  That's Shia territory and the people have suffered oppression.
1540 2018-08-09 21:02:08 To late bro, my oil is getting changed right now
1541 2018-08-09 21:02:04 It would also be a much stronger article if they didn’t present hydropower as a green/sustainable alternative energy source by placing it in the same category as wind and solar and then juxtaposing it to oil, gas, and coal.
1542 2018-08-09 21:01:41 Now, let me school you on how we fell into recession.

Oil prices went down but foreign reserves wasn't that too low to absorb the shock.

1. Buhari's TSA took all the working monies out of the banking system, no loans to give out so ongoing businesses and proposals had to die.

1549 2018-08-09 21:01:00 I hope all these thread gurus are right when they said coconut oil will make my lashes grow. I nearly blinded my self and I’m crying oil but I need something to make my face look at least a bit exciting so this shit better be worth it or I’m exposing

1551 2018-08-09 21:00:55 Glowing skin: Massage your face daily at night with almond oil and honey mixture and wash it with cold water after few minutes.
1552 2018-08-09 21:00:46 Tbh even coconut oil should be yielding more than this hmm.
1553 2018-08-09 21:00:45 To let you all know my husband will have a website up soon we are working on it for the CBD oil so you can make payment there and it can be shipped out to you. Most shipping's run between $5. To $8.00.
1554 2018-08-09 21:00:42 Brokered a deal, the oil is out there and they want it, check the fine print and see what she gave away to make the deal.
1555 2018-08-09 21:00:37 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1556 2018-08-09 21:00:31 You know your car is well engineered if the oil change guys can’t figure out how to check the air filter lol

1570 2018-08-09 20:59:03 The Calgary oil sands is the 3rd largest reserve in the world with  proven reserves of 165 billion barrels! It’s the  distribution of it that has Canadian provinces bickering. So, ya, Canada has a fucken shit load of it!

1573 2018-08-09 20:58:20 They've found oil in space
1574 2018-08-09 20:57:49 It’s not overheating but the temps are definitely being pushed l I feel like it’s gone uo a little over time but I might get a oil cooler or mishimoto radiator
1575 2018-08-09 20:57:41 Your water is not being given away...it is being stolen, like Scotland's oil.
1576 2018-08-09 20:57:35 @DicksDriveIns....do your buns contain soy flour or soybean oil?
1577 2018-08-09 20:57:31 ありがとうございます！！
これからもよらしくです
1578 2018-08-09 20:57:24 That too! I forget about the oil since well 1. I was almost strictly rbo’s and 2. I try to forget the things that have pained me the most
1579 2018-08-09 20:57:24 Check tyres, oil and adjust their chain, spot worn brakes, basics really but a lot can't do it right
1580 2018-08-09 20:57:04 Alex always pays for my oil change and today when my car was ready , they called me up by MRS.Castaneda   LMFAO NO!
1581 2018-08-09 20:56:58 You can have it, Libertards. In some other country. Fins are so deliriously happy. Go live in Finland. They’re also sitting on top of a huge oil reserve. That’s what pays for their pinko paradise.

1584 2018-08-09 20:56:52 Don't forget the yam will be hot. So the butter is literally melting into oil.
1585 2018-08-09 20:56:39 She was getting oil under the table along with France.
1586 2018-08-09 20:56:27 A challenge to all you engineers out there: how would you design a condom to accommodate a rotating metal penis that ejaculates hot motor oil?
1587 2018-08-09 20:56:18 Or it could be because they’re about to start a major drill programme in an area known for its oil and could be pumping 5000bopd within a few weeks.
1588 2018-08-09 20:56:10 i need to get a oil change but they’re taking forever
1589 2018-08-09 20:56:05 If I break your heart na oil spillage
1590 2018-08-09 20:56:04 No we are not! there is plenty of oil and we unlike Saudi Arabia believe in progress ,human rights and clean fuel it’s only greedy men that let them hold all the cards so they can line their pockets
1591 2018-08-09 20:56:01 olive oil, aka "you're probably just as well off using butter"??

1593 2018-08-09 20:56:00 I thought the turks hated YPG so much wasn't because YPG attacked turks (they did not, except in retaliation), but because erdo could not stand to see a Kurd-controlled and successful area. 

Also, erdo worked with daesh (oil trade, keeping border open, etc.)
1594 2018-08-09 20:55:57 No mames! Do an oil change if you’re down?
1595 2018-08-09 20:55:54 第四駆逐隊だと野分が一番すき
1596 2018-08-09 20:55:53 Just out here trying to be financially stable enough to say “yes” when the guys changing my oil suggest 5 other services that are “recommended today”
1597 2018-08-09 20:55:52 Heard about US Space Force - they know that there is no oil up there, right? #spaceforce #SpaceForce2020 #trump
1598 2018-08-09 20:55:51 He had his finger so far in his ear trying to dig it out, it was bleeding. The bus got there and off to the ER he went. It was 3am and you could hear him screaming throughout the apartment complex. The ER uses a glycerin oil to float it out.
1599 2018-08-09 20:55:44 It's actually the oil that adds the yellow colour! That's one of the ways I could always tell the oil was running low, we would get super white popcorn.
1600 2018-08-09 20:55:40 Yeah huge step forward when he jailed women activists that agreed with him about driving but jailed them anyways for being activists. You’re funny, we know it’s the money  and oil keeping your government’s mouths shut. America land of greed and gluttony.
1601 2018-08-09 20:55:33 Just stop buying thier oil ha ha ha

1603 2018-08-09 20:55:17 やはり東京の規模がおかしいのだろうな
1604 2018-08-09 20:55:14 I'm going to resist making a horrible otome pun because yeah...it sounds painful...and well it is painful trying to figure out this. It's a tool for use down a sub sea oil well. To get technical, a "stab" is a connecting tool for parts going down the pipe >_>;;
1605 2018-08-09 20:55:07 #SaudiArabia is always in the side of barbarism by cashing the #Islam. #Islam is only a tool to them as like as #oil. Deep condolence for #Yemen.
1606 2018-08-09 20:54:57 Gulf states are becoming less relevant to the U.S b/c of the increase in domestic oil production and the U.S no longer provides them z security guarantee and protection it used. They have to protect themselves particularly from rival and mortal enemy Iran. 1/2
1607 2018-08-09 20:54:45 I have this strange desire to wrestle this woman in a paddling pool full of baby oil.
1608 2018-08-09 20:54:34 Actually Ben that could be Katie's reaction to her A Level results this time next week....oh my days get ready.
1609 2018-08-09 20:54:31 This is a close call. If we're crediting olives for olive oil I honestly don't know if I can make it.
1610 2018-08-09 20:54:30 I don’t even feel like sitting up here to get this oil change
1611 2018-08-09 20:54:30 I'm sure that it is just socialism.  Not the crushing US sanctions or the price of oil, which Venezuela's entire economy is based around.  Nope.  Just socialism.
1612 2018-08-09 20:54:21 So let's just say my first time changing oil has gonna...poorly.
1613 2018-08-09 20:54:20 Maybe those workers will only apply every third or fourth rivet and only weld one side of the armour that can actually be seen. Maybe instead of bullet proof glass they'll use a triple glaze argon fill. Instead of 20w50 maybe they'll use oil from their kitchen. #ksa 
1614 2018-08-09 20:54:09 You're not even quite sure how you stumbled in here, on your way towards Spaceship Earth. The air is thick with rainbow smoke and eerie electronic music plays from...is that a Victrola? Grease, oil stings your nostrils. Through the haze, you swear you see a dragon grin.

1618 2018-08-09 20:53:39 Yeah. That’s your only issue. Ya frocking crucified someone a couple days ago and your screwing the Yemeni over big time. But ya- all good there. Keep your damn oil too

Tea tree oil is good but it made me broke out even more

1650 2018-08-09 20:49:06 Standard Oil dropped prices so low they never came back up.... Whoops they were bad monopolists (or the whole anti-trust concept is a fiction)
1651 2018-08-09 20:48:56 Noxzema daily face wash & their anti blemish pads is what I use daily or at night. If they dont have those pads I use the oxy ones. For moisturizer I usually use tea tree oil from the hair store or walmart.. I legit live off bad foods and stuff and using that helps my skin
1652 2018-08-09 20:48:55 They think they can establish a colony on Mars and all the rich people will get to go there after destroying the world for oil $$$.

1654 2018-08-09 20:48:39 @JergensUS Please tell me that you haven’t discontinued the Green Tea Oil scent!  It’s the lightest, most gender-neutral scent. Both husband and I use it. Hate coconut!  #wetskinmoisturizer
1655 2018-08-09 20:48:37 Lmao, roll in the oil

1657 2018-08-09 20:48:34 I have to tell you @RealAlexJones I was never a big fan, BUT, once the media pushed for your ban, and I tuned in the other day, I gotta say I'm back again today. Loved Roger Stone last night too. Will be making a donation next week. Can't say I'll buy the Fish oil though lol.
1658 2018-08-09 20:48:33 But if Tesla continues to do well, won’t the ultimate “Big Oil”, Saudi Arabia, now profit? I’m so confused. $TSLA
1659 2018-08-09 20:48:32 WHAAAT? IN the POCKET OF BIG OIL!!
1660 2018-08-09 20:48:31 Yeah - I’m not sure either. I was referencing this here bc the last big oil crisis contributed to a shift in political thinking and played a huge role in the rise of neoliberalism and the willingness to give theories of Hayek/Friedman a shot. Might happen again, might not
1661 2018-08-09 20:48:30 I know a lady who produces coconut oil in commercial quantity. She's not on twitter tho

1663 2018-08-09 20:48:08 I know that @BankoftheWest will "no longer conduct business with companies engaged in the exploration and production of coal, oil and natural gas," but will they still write car loans for vehicles that use fuel generated from them?  If not, then aren't they just pandering?
1664 2018-08-09 20:48:08 Yeah it’s when i turn my AC on but it was fine before i got my oil changed! Is it possible they like dropped something in the wrong spot?
1665 2018-08-09 20:48:04 Saudi Arabia has significant influence on the price of crude oil, and other minor arab kingdoms. The only way to end Saudi influence. Is to have more domestic. Oil and gas production in allied nations, and reduced consumption. So we dont need arab oil and can ignore them.

How many drone killings?

How long was his kill list?

Didn't he run out of bombs?

America kills brown people for oil. That's all.

1701 2018-08-09 20:44:21 Unlike Lac-Megantic, oil by rail is more acceptable within Burnaby, which is mainly built above CP rail lines
1702 2018-08-09 20:44:11 Chloe, your tweet caught our eye. A word of caution: most manufacturers of cast iron cookware advise you to "seal" the pan/skillet with oil over high heat. Sealing the pan actually blocks to release of iron.

1707 2018-08-09 20:43:43 One with whole wheat flour and coconut oil instead of butter
1708 2018-08-09 20:43:38 Why are we so dependant on buying oil when we have so much here in Canada? This needs to change. Build refineries that will employ hundreds if not thousands of Canadians
1709 2018-08-09 20:43:27 I was recently introduced to this brand of oil and hair stuff called Moroccan Oil and it's hella good!
1710 2018-08-09 20:43:26 Is that the same deficit that includes money (we are not allowed to) but borrowed by the UK and not used in Scotland ? Does it include the taxes from 100 % of oil, gas, electricity, water, whiskey, etc etc and not the measly 8% we currently get ? 
1711 2018-08-09 20:43:24 So plastic, which is a carbon-based polymer made from oil, releases carbon into the atmosphere when it decomposes. 
1712 2018-08-09 20:42:57 I’m getting my oil changed I totally didn’t go 1400 miles over 
1713 2018-08-09 20:42:52 He injected warm oil in his muscles. That's why they look like that.
1714 2018-08-09 20:42:46 And keep buying it we will, because our retard PM has blocked a pipeline to allow Eastern Canada to get its oil from Western Canada.
1715 2018-08-09 20:42:40 When you run out of oil you just make your meal Cajun.

1723 2018-08-09 20:42:07 Run down your State, without facts. Edo State has a higher GDP than Akwa-Ibom. Has higher road networks.

Yet don't produce oil as much as Always Ibom. There's a lot to write home about, please
1724 2018-08-09 20:42:00 You need dry oil spray 
1725 2018-08-09 20:41:54 There has to be some logical explanation for why people voted for Trump and Brexit and that's my latest theory for it. We've become gullible to snake oil salesmen like Farage and Trump.

1729 2018-08-09 20:40:53 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1730 2018-08-09 20:40:48 We are just not lucky to have strategic thinker as leaders,  they are lazy and just wait for the assured oil revenue. Agriculture can employ over 30million nigerians along the value chains.  Even the so called oil is sold crude,  no value added.

1732 2018-08-09 20:40:43 That is because cannibis strains matter. RSO is not CBD oil. Many fail to make that distinction and specificity. Rick Simpson used Indica strands to make RSO. NOT sativas. Indica is THC heavy and will knock out cancer cells. Whereas for CBD, there are a wide spectrum of them.
1733 2018-08-09 20:40:42 Splashed oil all over my palm cooking my first steak today. Fml it'l take a few hours before the pain goes away.
1734 2018-08-09 20:40:41 I saw the spoilers and I wanna know what goes through there minds when they pair these things together in a box. Why do I need a cuticle oil but also a bright ass shadow palette & a brown gel liner? Might as well have me glitter mascara too.

1739 2018-08-09 20:40:30 let's go back to the barter system.

1745 2018-08-09 20:39:53 There are less than a dozen 'highly paid union leaders' in the country, and the influence they wield in relation to business leaders is minuscule. At least they're democratically elected. Thr 70s was our most equal decade with higher growth than the 80s, despite the oil crisis.
1746 2018-08-09 20:39:50 Things the US has money for:
- Space Force (Farce)
- More military spending than next 8 countries combined
- $12B on Farmer bailouts
- $18.5B in Oil & Gas subsidies

Things the US can't afford:
- Medicare/Medicaid
- Social Security
- Relief for Puerto Rico
- Clean H2O for Flint
1747 2018-08-09 20:39:39 - LoonyQuest (imported): players draw freehand lines on acrylic sheets and overlay them on a map and count up hits and misses

1749 2018-08-09 20:39:13 Has anyone seen that check from Mexico that was going to pay for the ridiculous wall? More importantly, where are all the manufacturing and steel jobs Trump promised voters in PA, OH, MI, and WI? Be clear - a snake oil salesman now sits in our White House. #Basta #FightClub

1752 2018-08-09 20:38:40 So you’re telling me this olive oil never had sex
1753 2018-08-09 20:38:40 What Putin should fear is the next POTUS will be under incredible pressure to revenge Russia for meddling in US internal affairs. Obama/KSA were able to bring Russia’s economy to its knees by glutting the oil market. What could a united and purposeful response from the US/EU do?

1758 2018-08-09 20:38:20 Sure, I mean, that's how international trade works, I guess. But why not USE our oil domestically, sell the excess for the most we can get for it (profit) and SELL commodities and resources other countries DON'T grow/make/produce/manufacture.

I know it's more complicated.

1768 2018-08-09 20:37:14 If successive UK governments had properly managed oil and gas by adopting similar policies to Norway and having a sovereign wealth fund then it would be earning more in revenue and would be earning a huge investment income forever if well managed.
1769 2018-08-09 20:37:12 Canada is an oil producing nation, we don't we refine it ourselves and save incredible amounts of money. We can funnel profits into green energy infrastructure

1771 2018-08-09 20:37:00 FOTD: A lot of people are unsure about how often they should replace their air filter. Most manufacturers recommend every 15,000 to 30,000 km. The more you drive your car (especially in dusty environments), then the more often you should replace the filter.

Regardless, I’d argue the solution is to break up the monopolies like the USA did with Bell Atlantic and Standard Oil.
1785 2018-08-09 20:36:12 Energy East would not have replaced Saudi oil as the eastern refineries aren’t equipped to process our bitumen sands oil. and I think you already knew that. why lie?

1815 2018-08-09 20:32:47 It’s a weird argument to begin with since the clock on “the American Era” started winding down in the 70s. The balance of power has lurched towards multipolarity since, w emerging major and lesser regional powers/systems. The US only defends USD/oil and the nuclear status quo  
1816 2018-08-09 20:32:38 The fuck do we even buy oil from Saudi Arabia for? 

Don't we have enough oil here that we're trying to sell it to China?

Him: How is s this an authentic Jurassic park experience?! This is ridiculous I want my money back!
Me: Listen bud, these are made of plastic right?
Plastic is made from oil
Oil is made from fossils
Fossils..REAL DINOSAURS
No refund.
1825 2018-08-09 20:31:46 I just managed to splash hot cooking oil on myself, so now I've got five small wounds on my belly that look like some wizard poked me w/all fingers on one hand but forgot to turn his fwoosh off first.

It feels a lot less fun than I imagine it would if there had been a wizard..
1826 2018-08-09 20:31:42 How,  Okay, haba. Wow

1828 2018-08-09 20:31:29 Exactly, Libertarian thought is a process that requires effort and the will to dig deeper. Most people dgaf about that, instead they rely exclusively on the promises of snake oil salesmen. We'd have to somehow convince them that "parentalism is bad... um-k."
1829 2018-08-09 20:31:13 Does Canada not use any of its own oil? I thought they were supposed to have ton's and ton's of it...why are they importing any at all? 
1830 2018-08-09 20:30:52 Dang if we stopped taking their oil.... Sheesh we might have to use our own...
1831 2018-08-09 20:30:52 Great #bibleverse to end the day. Psalm 141:5

"Let a righteous man strike me-that is a kindness; let him rebuke me-that is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it, for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers."

Q: Do I value a loving rebuke fr one of God's ppl?
1832 2018-08-09 20:30:46 Any tips on how to help your hair grow? I know, no heat. I do a coconut oil mask once a week. I have curly, thick, frizzy hair and I'm trying to find products to help grow, and products to use instead of heat.

1838 2018-08-09 20:29:43 The standard reports that Levy values us at £2bn. There have been whispers of a stateside takeover by Disney/Zuckerberg/ Another giant. I’m sure they would pay that price tbh. For fans expecting an oil rich Saudi company to buy us, I doubt that due to our NLon location + heritage

1841 2018-08-09 20:29:27 USA IRAN WAR : Can we make Pakistani products more competitive because economic sanction  restrict India to buy Oil from Iran .Alternate buying from Saudia and Russia will increase Indian cost of Production .
1842 2018-08-09 20:29:25 Very petty country...like do they know the effect it will have on their economy seeing that Canada's main imports from them is Oil which is their main commodity?!
1843 2018-08-09 20:29:14 You did not say a word when Trump proposed drilling for oil 3 miles off Florida's shoreline.  Republicans have been in charge of our water for 20 years and this is the result!!
1844 2018-08-09 20:29:01 i just put at least a whole bottle of tanning oil on,,, sooo i best be tan asap
1845 2018-08-09 20:28:52 Everything, EVERYTHING, is about the damn oil. It is killing US. This just has to be stopped.
1846 2018-08-09 20:28:51 If Trudeau  was serious he would expedite Energy East.He has no intention of allowing that and we will continue to import oil for Eastern Canada. Only naive Canadanns would permit this.

1849 2018-08-09 20:28:22 Come on Senator, where are your priorities?  

Where will go when fracking, burning fossil fuels, drilling for oil, reinstating the use of asbestos, and building our nuclear arsenal all take their toll and the world is no longer inhabital.

You're not thinking logically.
1850 2018-08-09 20:28:01 Irving Oil processes lighter crude in its refinery than that available from Western Canada. I am not sure about the offshore Nfld  crude but price is also a factor.
1851 2018-08-09 20:27:58 Ain't nothing slick to a can of oil
1852 2018-08-09 20:27:52 France reduced its dependence on foreign oil and other fossil fuels by building a fleet of nuclear reactors in the 70s and 80s.

By happy accident, they also significantly reduced their carbon footprint, and have one of the lowest levels of carbon intensity in the EU.

1860 2018-08-09 20:26:20 Oh my God what did they do a fine tolerant secular country like Syria for Shia hate( Saudi Barbaria), oil and golan heights. Iran is no angel, but Syria was used as a guinea pig to weaken Iran. Even magazines like Economist openly advocated training Jihadis against Assad!

1862 2018-08-09 20:26:12 53+ years ago, cocoa was responsible for 60% of our revenue. Today, as overall second largest export and largest agriculture export, it accounts for less than 1% of our revenue. 
Productivity slumped but that doesn't bother the political elite.

1866 2018-08-09 20:25:55 Legacy automakers have poisoned the planet over generations and benefit from insane subsidies (read: oil wars). Toyota, Nissan and Renault and others continue to prioritize high margin gas guzzlers. They should die on the vine; companies focused on sustainable transport must win.

1872 2018-08-09 20:25:02 Franklin is wrong about not relating to culture, that is what went wrong when white man landed on the now broken promised land. We are doing the same thing in the Middle East now: corporations went in after oil, never trying to understand the many different cultures.
1873 2018-08-09 20:24:48 Classes are (almost) back in session! Which #BackToSchool item made possible by oil and gas is your favorite?
1874 2018-08-09 20:24:48 Forgot the baby oil x
1875 2018-08-09 20:24:18 Stop subsidizing the oil industry, giving them special favor. Prices go up, people become uncomfortable. Take those oil subsidies and put them into renewables and electric car development.
1876 2018-08-09 20:24:16 We still need fossil fuels for the transition to #GreenEnergy 
98% of automobiles still use gasoline.
I would rather the world use Canadian oil than oil from Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. 

Beside it’s the use we need to stop.

1883 2018-08-09 20:23:35 So the larger question really is why are we not supporting ourselves with our own oil?

1887 2018-08-09 20:23:13 Ya but the world still wants to do business with these murderers because of $$$$ and oil! Same as dealing with the next era of Nazis running the US! More appeasement from world cowards!

1890 2018-08-09 20:22:54 Those weak are have around 40% of oil in the world. The global oil price under their hand.
1891 2018-08-09 20:22:53 I'm pretty sure there ain't no Oil in space.. because if it did america would build camps in there lol
1892 2018-08-09 20:22:52 yep..I could be muddling my small one up with my big one.
I do that sometimes 
1893 2018-08-09 20:22:50 Not so fast, Raymond. He apologized to the natives for the residential schools. So, he can apologize. But the real point is that if he apologizes to the Saudis, he will be turning his back on feminists and gays here in Canada. To hell with Saudi Arabia, we have our own oil.
1894 2018-08-09 20:22:48 dk if bathing ur lashes in castor oil is considered self care all ik is they better grow 3cm by the time i wake up
1895 2018-08-09 20:22:47 You see we would have some allies to defend us but unfortunately, cheap oil so they're like nawh.

1897 2018-08-09 20:22:37 I think boiled linseed oil would be the best bang for buck, but it could clog up the mechanism.. I'm sure sunflower would be covered by the warranty though.
1898 2018-08-09 20:21:52 Yes it is, CBD oil without the THC is legal anywhere in the world...
1899 2018-08-09 20:21:36 #SaudiArabia is an important ally to the US. The US and the rest of the world needs their oil, otherwise the world economy would go into full fledge economic meltdown. As for @JustinTrudeau   the little man should be more respectful towards other nations' customs and culture

1905 2018-08-09 20:20:49 Oil revenue will recede, and even if it does not given current global challenges, our legislature will continue the economic blockage characteristic of their past 2 years. 

Who suffers? The common man
1906 2018-08-09 20:20:48 Literally anyone other than Oil Can Boyd
1907 2018-08-09 20:20:45 Totally agree. Stop receipt, build #EnergyEast, and refine our own oil. We have the capacity. It might cost a few cents more than the Saudis charge, but think of the benefits for the Canadian economy.
1908 2018-08-09 20:20:45 There you go peanuts out the window but heaven forbid if we could move our oil! Groper tell them you don’t need it Canads has more than enough oh right your a clueless liberal that will be sucking the prince by the end of the month

1915 2018-08-09 20:19:54 Started using vitamin E oil. My skin is already oily so I think it just clogged my pores up. I thought it would help 
1916 2018-08-09 20:19:52 FG is cheating Kano and Kwara. They deserve 13% like other oil producing states. Kano is producing groundnut oil while Kwara is producing hantu oil.

Oil na oil. Pay them.

1944 2018-08-09 20:17:24 It is all oil game. Since they have oil west will interfere and intervene.
1945 2018-08-09 20:17:12 What kind of oil are we talking? Like coconut oil? And would I do this before using my face wash?
1946 2018-08-09 20:17:12 Omg. WHAT is an air fryer? Is this something I should have? Is it the instant pot of frying? I hate the splattering of oil. Twitter, tell me!
1947 2018-08-09 20:17:09 Stop buying their oil would have more effect than retweeting anything.
1948 2018-08-09 20:17:04 How about we send Saudi oil back and use Alberta oil?
1949 2018-08-09 20:16:52 Irving refineries in NB refine SA oil. That’s our 10%. If we refine Canadian oil in NB we won’t need SA oil. If we can ship Canadian oil through BC we’re in the Asian market.

To correct @mrc314 , Crisco ain't harmful, and neither is corn oil in a rodent keto diet.

1960 2018-08-09 20:16:03 When they arrive on earth, it’s allegory for oil crises which were still fresh in plastic toy executives’ minds in early 80s. Only badly written recent attempts to show the start of war retconned it to be only about decepticon communist uprising.
1961 2018-08-09 20:16:02 If its un relatable to you then you can let it pass
1962 2018-08-09 20:15:45 Does that mean replacing what came out thus, adding pressure back into the system to help bring more oil to the surface?  The way you talk about it you make it sound very much like fracking.....which it isn’t, is it?
1963 2018-08-09 20:15:19 We gotsta control all the world's oil some way. :-)
1964 2018-08-09 20:15:18 I got such a process for getting ready I shower use body wash then use a shower body lotion then GET out use a baby coconut oil then I use some smell good lotion
1965 2018-08-09 20:15:14 I literally live in fear for my life.  

I type this from my own garage.  The hordes of ne'er-do-wells are baying for my olive oil from the once-quiet street outside my house in an orderly, if somewhat Brexit-disaffected, fashion.

Send help.
1966 2018-08-09 20:15:13 Tell them to keep their f@#$&* oil,we’ll use our own.
1967 2018-08-09 20:15:05 Once the reversal of historic knowledge had occurred, the education system had to follow that curriculum. Hence, when the reverse history began to be taught. That became the "bar." FDA, Companies, Oil companies, Medicine business- how do you think that all became?
1968 2018-08-09 20:15:04 truffle oil
1969 2018-08-09 20:14:57 Aparrently our close allies . Nice to know where our governments priorities lie. Only in the blackest oil wells of greed
1970 2018-08-09 20:14:57 There should be a Federal Law against snake oil religion that states gig will heal babies
When all through history babies need nutrition & medical care.. Faith Healing? SMH
1971 2018-08-09 20:14:54 Whose idea was this?!?
1972 2018-08-09 20:14:53 There's a hell of a lot of UNIONIST 'Nameless', Leading Economists, in 2014 these same people told us all OIL will run out in 10 years.

There will always be lying unionists who think Scotland can't afford it, they said the same about USA & India & Malta, speaking of them ...
1973 2018-08-09 20:14:31 I find your prose to be lubriciously effective, and as such, find your subject oil to be among the best.
1974 2018-08-09 20:14:18 We should have broken ties with Saudi Arabia years ago when we didn’t need their oil. This country forgives to quickly sometimes. Not only the most oppressive society they are responsible for 911. 18 out of 20 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. We need to sanction them
1975 2018-08-09 20:14:17 I haven't done not even one oil change since 7am  boring AF!!
1976 2018-08-09 20:14:09 Struck Oil/Juice!!!
1977 2018-08-09 20:14:04 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
1978 2018-08-09 20:13:46 I'd be a bit more worried about Climate Change if I were you. If not you could look into Big Oil, the Rothschild's, Jewish Bankers, Soros, and their roles in causing Climate Change!
1979 2018-08-09 20:13:38 I think it’s actually cooking oil lol
1980 2018-08-09 20:13:27 I think the first thing we should is ban buying oil from the Saudi GGovernment, we have enough oil here to take care of our selves, Ontario and Quebec will have to let the pipeline be reversed so they can have good cheap Canadian oil.
1981 2018-08-09 20:13:24 Its not loyalty but lifeline for european now :) 
Be cautious with oil. It catches fire :)
1982 2018-08-09 20:13:20 Day 2.221
Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid! Do just what you’ve said, but make a little bread for me first. Then prepare a meal for yourself and your son. For this is what God says: The flour and oil won’t be used up until the Lord sends rain on the land again!”
(1K 17:13-14)
1983 2018-08-09 20:13:12 So basically you moisturize before bed and in the morning with an oil of your choice, depending on what works best for your skin
1984 2018-08-09 20:13:03 Oh well if the moon has oil...
1985 2018-08-09 20:12:56 Tbh it would be cool to see oil slick style on the ones why never bleach, cuz that style is less damaging, but idk if Kor kpop knows about it
1986 2018-08-09 20:12:54 Hey buddy when you guys run out of oil just let Canada know. I'm sure we can help you guys out. Not to mention we're by far your largest trade partner. We thrive off one another. That's how it's always been.
1987 2018-08-09 20:12:54 I made an oil tit worship video and a cum hitachi video. 
1988 2018-08-09 20:12:39 Thank you President Trump your decision on tariffs & crackdown on Iranian oil great move.
1989 2018-08-09 20:12:36 Ok but why did he take a swig of oil before he got in? *Its cheaper than food LMAO
1990 2018-08-09 20:12:33 What does 73m3 look like, because to me that sounds like 73 t of liquid, is that waste that was separated out after the oil came to the ground....how many barrels per day? How big is a barrel either litres or m3, so at 40 barrels per day over how many months......
1991 2018-08-09 20:12:24 And Trudeau continues to import oil from Saudi Arabia ...
1992 2018-08-09 20:12:12 As long as we're paying $2B for imported Saudi oil then the liberals are distancing nothing.  Clearly the Saudi's are the ones calling the shots. They not only have been given the cake by the liberals, they've decided to continue eating the $2B taxpayer cake!
1993 2018-08-09 20:12:11 なんだか予定より早い時間に出ちゃったぞ
1994 2018-08-09 20:12:08 My hair is so fucking soft this OGX hydration oil is the fucking one
1995 2018-08-09 20:12:01 Cosplay is such an experience

When I cosplayed Magnus from #TheZoneCast , I wore lavender oil. Not that anyone I was with would know why, but... little things like that are really great
1996 2018-08-09 20:11:50 I bathed him everyday & put coconut oil. That helped a lot
1997 2018-08-09 20:11:49 Knife attacks, European decades-long loyalty to Arab oil money, UN lunacy, Gaza withdrawal, Gaza blockade, PA international funding...
1998 2018-08-09 20:11:41 Agreed. I think the oil wealth funds serve as proof of concept. The point of UBI is in some part to offset the impacts on the need for labor due to AI and automation. We’d have to tax the marginal productivity gains to fund UBI. There has to be some response to the coming changes
1999 2018-08-09 20:11:38 8 Billion for a farcical 'Space Force' but 250 million for safe elections is impossible.

Snake oil, pure and refined.
2000 2018-08-09 20:11:35 Please relate this with that tweet.
2001 2018-08-09 20:11:12 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a brutal experience. So brutal.
2002 2018-08-09 20:11:07 Israeli lobby, CIA and UK intelligence agents propoganda at full steam with their puppets. Recycling old videos. They destroyed a fine secular country like Syria, can live with Saudi Barbaria, but want to destroy Iran for oil and golan heights.
2003 2018-08-09 20:11:01 For brain function and joint lubrication... strong Brew. Per 2 cups: T coconut oil, 1 T  grass fed butter.. electric blend for 30 seconds and you have one decadent healthy cup of coffee to start off your day
2004 2018-08-09 20:10:52 Just called @JerryBrownGov office: 1-855-636-8150 (via @Greenpeace #) to express my support of the young ppl who got arrested at his office yesterday; to say end #oil drilling in residential neighborhoods; & no new #oil & #gas permits, incl OFFSHORE. cc @DanBacher @Sammy_Roth
2005 2018-08-09 20:10:49 Did you know? When rubbing sweat away, you can rub dirt, oil, and debris into your pores. Before exercise, wash your face, remove any makeup, and use a toner to prevent exercise acne. #AcneTips #AcneHelp
2006 2018-08-09 20:10:39 adulting means getting my oil changed on my lunch break
2007 2018-08-09 20:10:36 Thank you for this candid statement Mr. Greenwald - Trudeau's more superficial aspects really are used to cover up things like this or the way he is setting up an oil pipeline into Puget Sound.
2008 2018-08-09 20:10:32 @pacificlogging una empresa que naciò para cambiar la manera de ser proveedora de servicos petroleros #Oil #energy #oilandgas
2009 2018-08-09 20:10:27 Wait oh the way Saudi Arabia & Qatar are spending oil money makes me think if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
2010 2018-08-09 20:10:23 マテウスーマテウスー飲みにいこーぜー
2011 2018-08-09 20:10:18 I bet this guy had a folksy wisdom that puts any coastal dweller to shame. Ask an elitist where their oil filter is...go ahead, ask them.
2012 2018-08-09 20:10:17 I remember seeing The Cheviot, The Stag and the Black, Black Oil when I was a kid on the bbc. Didn’t entirely understand it but I knew it was powerful.
2013 2018-08-09 20:10:10 We are in Tesla and it’s done very well and we charge Teslas with solar. Good luck sucking the tail pipe of Big Oil . Don’t forget the next oil crash is being engineered by our commander and chief. Have fun begging for gas in the rationing lines.
2014 2018-08-09 20:10:09 #AAOG - even without Djeno, Mengo and R1/R2 Will be significantly profitable for the company with oil price on the up!
2015 2018-08-09 20:10:08 Darklinks oil is changed, his engine is good we ready no matter what
2016 2018-08-09 20:10:05 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
2017 2018-08-09 20:10:03 We have to start thinking of it as medical.  I use  CBD oil on my dog got thunder storm phobia.  I then started taking it for general muscle strain and it worked wonderfully.
2018 2018-08-09 20:10:01 Asuwear. Everton too. Like some oil money dey push Dem too?
2019 2018-08-09 20:09:51 #ThursdayFellowship yes, provide for those in Zion who mourn, giving them garlands instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, a cloak of praise instead of a heavy spirit,
2020 2018-08-09 20:09:30 You have your opinion. I have mine. Coal has been the victim of a demonization campaign with heavy investment from the natural gas industry. It's not a perfect fuel, but it isn't the devil it has been portrayed to be, especially in comparison with oil and gas.
2021 2018-08-09 20:09:17 Oil purchases, arms sales and kick backs.
2022 2018-08-09 20:09:02 Justin has to stop grandstanding.  He’s all talk, no action.  How about stop buying Saudi oil, and build the frigging Kindermorgan pipeline
2023 2018-08-09 20:08:43 Use the amoured cars to transport western oil to the eastern refineries. Easy-peasy...
2024 2018-08-09 20:08:39 its plain flour dough innit ... they put a small bit of oil on the pan and fry it basically ...peng  when done right they are peng
2025 2018-08-09 20:08:38 And why is that not happening nowI got a better idea while looking for an Icon  just have too find out what a barrel of B.C. Bud Oil would be worth! Maybe a pipeline is a good idea 
2026 2018-08-09 20:08:31 i broke my fucking weed oil and now i have no weed all over again i ducking want to DIE
2027 2018-08-09 20:08:22 So now entire countries qualify. If this holds everyone cheering it will live to regret it. Lines will stretch from Tijuana to Mexico City.
2028 2018-08-09 20:08:16 Another sign of Trump/Modi bromance:
Indian Oil purchase of US oil
2017  6.6MM barrels
2018  estimated to be 16MM barrels 

Iran is losing one of its main buyers besides China; 100k Iranians marching in the streets "Death to Dictator"

Oh Canada  #uspoli #cdnpoli #ableg
2029 2018-08-09 20:08:14 Because it’s SAUDI ARABIA! Btw, the situation is cooling down. SA needs to sell us their oil. Lol!
2030 2018-08-09 20:08:05 Snake Oil Salesman. Sorry...had to use 3 words.
2031 2018-08-09 20:07:54 there ya go..you are all set..chat room..course, newsletter, podcast and a website with a donate button..hey you can also write a book.. Saudi Jawboning Inc and plug that on your site,, you never have to trade..but still claim expertise with all the motivational crap :) #OOTT
2032 2018-08-09 20:07:47 Expected Maps in the early release:
~ Some city map
~ A huge ass ship carrier next to a city
~ Low dense city

~ Possibly some secret bank in a middle of a damn forest?
~ Possibly some facility
~ Possibly a deep ass desert cave
~ Possibly an oil rig
2033 2018-08-09 20:07:45 Now that US & Europe are supplying weapons to the Medieval Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia, who will protect the Children & Women of Yemen who are being killed every day by Saudi Arabia? Today, Saudi Arabia killed 19 children in a school bus.  SAD the world is blinded by Oil Money.
2034 2018-08-09 20:07:43 How do you do that when they have the oil
2035 2018-08-09 20:07:36 Y’all I seriously recommend a facial oil shit makes u feel moisturised af
2036 2018-08-09 20:07:25 What a fraud, people in the former Yugoslavia did this 30 years ago during the embargo. All old diesel engines run on cooking oil. Anyway this is nothing new, people do it all over the world, it has been done for decades so this is just dumb click-bait.
2037 2018-08-09 20:07:23 Like the dressing?

But I'm NSNG.

Coconut oil okay?
2038 2018-08-09 20:07:02 Maybe. Or maybe it is the equivalent of a gas station. "I'm going down to the Chevron station to pick up some oil filters."
2039 2018-08-09 20:07:00 Absolutely brill still can't get over what they did to the forests in Borneo where the Orangutans lived.God bless the woman who opened the sanctuary for them, all the babies who fell out of their mums arms onto the forest floor and missed the bulldozers. #palm oil ouutrage anger!
2040 2018-08-09 20:06:57 I'm more of a frack it, just nuke 'em person, but the KSA is already walking back from 'dumping' assets, will continue to sell oil, and I suspect they still want their 'lavs'.  War in Yemen is tough. Getting their students and sick out of country is a win-win for us.
2041 2018-08-09 20:06:55 Why are you upset about a citizen trying to hold a corporation accountable to our basic laws? It aught to be federally reviewed.  Oil & Gas corps shouldnt just choose the easier jurisdiction and skirt due diligence and good governance.
2042 2018-08-09 20:06:38 So was intel on the WMD’s in Iraq. Everyone knew it. Mattered not. The US needed to protect its oil interests and the petrodollar.
2043 2018-08-09 20:06:37 Luckily the rain is just beading off the track due to the oil we put down.

2046 2018-08-09 20:06:25 This is old technology, biodiesel and waste vegetable oil diesel conversions are common in some places.
2047 2018-08-09 20:06:23 #neverforget when he called you a rotisserie chicken bc you were laying out in the sun with coconut oil on
2048 2018-08-09 20:06:11 I should just buy a flip phone because i just got this phone 2 weeks ago and it just fell out of my pocket into the oil pan and oil covered my phone and now my speakers are fucked up. I hate phones
2049 2018-08-09 20:06:08 Hey @POTUS We MUST Break Up #GOOGLE #FACEBOOK #AMAZON =Innovation is Stifled when there is NO COMPITETION: Today's JUST LIKE WHEN STANDARD OIL was BROKEN UP it's JUST the internet that is "NEW" instead of OiL= #DOJ can Use the same SHERMAN act for a MODERN PURPOSE $AMZN $FB $GOOG
2050 2018-08-09 20:05:56 Scrub and oil it.
2051 2018-08-09 20:05:55 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2052 2018-08-09 20:05:39 This might be the best chance we have to get progressives/liberals in the East and BC to get behind Alberta oil. Now is the time to cut the Saudi taps to this country off.
2053 2018-08-09 20:05:35 InfoChip is the only custom ID provider focused on providing heavy-duty tags for the oil & gas markets.
2054 2018-08-09 20:05:30 Loyal to the oil
2055 2018-08-09 20:05:24 $CL_F break below 66.31 would expose 66.04 - 65.61 as next short-term area of interest #Oil #Elliottwave
2056 2018-08-09 20:05:16 $CL_F got rejected in 67.31 - 67.81 blue box area and already reached 50 back of rally from 66.48 so shorts risk free #Elliottwave #Oil
2057 2018-08-09 20:05:15 Stopped eating KitKat after what I heard about the palm oil and the orangutans.
2058 2018-08-09 20:05:12 Finally made it to Lucas Oil.  Time for some Drum Corps!!
2059 2018-08-09 20:05:07 Baking in the oven with a little olive oil on top is the best in my opinion
2060 2018-08-09 20:04:57 $70 for an oil change... 
2061 2018-08-09 20:04:55 Couldn’t figure out why my asparagus tasted like a pina colada.. then remembered I cooked it in coconut oil 
2062 2018-08-09 20:04:46 Exactly they’re country used to be full of poverty. It wasn’t even until 40-50 years ago when they began to export oil that they gained wealth.
2063 2018-08-09 20:04:35 Extracting 1 trillion cubic feet of petroleum has led to heating oceans & magma instability. This is a strange fact left out of 'climate science'. How would you suggest getting the oil cartel to change their ways?
2064 2018-08-09 20:04:31 It’s a matter of sovereignty and dignity & not hurting Canada’s economy as #SaudiArabia demonstrated by its commitment of oil shipments deals with Canada,,,besides, it’s out of ignorance to say Canada’s economy can be hurt by one country,, your commitment connotes bad intentions
2065 2018-08-09 20:04:23 Dang, 10 million barrel increase in US oil to India...
2066 2018-08-09 20:04:22 I’m having trouble finding actual scientific evidence about candle/oil safety & pets. A TON of anecdotal stories & (willful) misunderstanding of chemistry, though. :////
2067 2018-08-09 20:04:00 Canada is capitalist. Only socialist aspect is the universal health care. And you do realize Scandanavia makes huge profit off oil revenue. That is clearly a capitalist aspect.

2076 2018-08-09 20:03:05 My coconut oil fell and broke.
2077 2018-08-09 20:03:02 My tanning oil smells like flowers so I get chased by bees at the pool FUCK
2078 2018-08-09 20:02:54 Actual thing my doctors have said to me:

“I can see this is upsetting you. Have you tried anti depressants?”

“Evening primrose oil will help.”

Upon finding out there’s family history...”That was 20 years ago, we don’t just operate now.”

“Can’t you just rest for that week?”
2079 2018-08-09 20:02:48 Brent oil entered cumulative buying levels on 72 then 69 then 66 and may bounce up from any of these points..
2080 2018-08-09 20:02:47 im not agreeing with it thats just true for america.and most modern countrys like we are on Saudi Arabia side even though they have a horrible human rights record because there attacking Yemen one of the usa enemy's.and Saudi has lots of oil .
2081 2018-08-09 20:02:46 Ευχαριστώ & γι΄αυτή την πληροφορία!
Έκανα το πείραμα με το baby oil: είχε 1 καλό & 1 κακό...
Το καλό είναι πως έκανα δερματάκι μωρού!
Το κακό είναι πως από το μεσημέρι που έβαλα λαδάκι
με τσίμπησαν όλα τα κουνούπια της γειτονιάς
ενώ τώρα κάλεσαν για δείπνο & το σόι απ΄το χωριό!!!
2082 2018-08-09 20:02:44 because Canadians saw fit to elect a PM who believes Canadian oil should stay in the ground and put the fix in to never construct a west to east pipeline
2083 2018-08-09 20:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
2084 2018-08-09 20:02:27 Ryleigh rubbing this sleeping oil all on herself , be my guest Lil girl.
2085 2018-08-09 20:02:06 @kausmickey Trump and Republicans making it more difficult all the time to vote for them. “Space Force” is a complete joke. I can’t stand what seem to be Trump’s goals - being the big oil king and outspending all other presidents combined on defense. BUT NO MONEY FOR WALL!
2086 2018-08-09 20:01:51 I need to bring my oil disseminator to my new classroom because it smells like construction adhesive.
2087 2018-08-09 20:01:42 My mom recently started cooking with coconut oil and let me tell y’all.... FRIJOLES ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO TASTE LIKE COCNUT SMH IM MAD
2088 2018-08-09 20:01:29 Took the hearse in to get an oil change, and everyone's just staring at me. Only one brave soul came forward to help me.

They're all missin out on driving the nicest Caddy in the Hills.
2089 2018-08-09 20:01:27 You are absolutely right. And it's exactly those R's that Ann is talking about. The wall could be paid for easily...@realDonaldTrump even said it during the election...Cash remittances to Mexico EXCEED the countries revenue from OIL. Slap a 33% tax on them an that's $7B / year.
2090 2018-08-09 20:01:21 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
2091 2018-08-09 20:01:09 ofの目的格用法、苦手な人が多いね。discovery of oil「石油の発見」、love of liberty「自由を愛すること」とか。みんなlove of a mother「母の愛」とかrise of the sun「日の出」みたいな主格用法は得意かも。
2092 2018-08-09 20:01:00 According to cals reviewed by @HuffPost, @ScottPruittOK spent more time meeting with oil, gas, & coal industry officials than w/ environmental & public health advocates during his initial weeks in office #EnvironmentalAwareness #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateChange cc @lydiaoconnor
2093 2018-08-09 20:00:52 Hahaha for real! I was like oh so you mean I slept for like 5 min?... her “no! I still had to take the pan out, put oil on it, wait for it to heat up.” Hahaha you know how dramatic lore can be. 
2094 2018-08-09 20:00:50 Hi Katy. The virgins who wait for the Bridegroom all start with oil but the foolish don’t bring enough to last them until He comes. What we believe before the night grows late matters.
2095 2018-08-09 20:00:45 Intetesting could this be fue yo the fact we don 't need their oil and that PM actually had the sumcks to stand his ground and not hide in a cupboard or non existant while this happens how can you expect to lead us if you don't stand up for us
2096 2018-08-09 20:00:34 Hurts to think he might be taken out by one of the cruel hunting practices Zinke is trying to reinstate. Pretty despicable times when you see beauty & immediately grieve due to threat of its loss.
See them now, before this is an oil field & that bear's head is hanging on a wall.
2097 2018-08-09 20:00:32 We should stop funding this backwards regime. We have plenty of oil right here in Canada. Cut them off ASAP

2099 2018-08-09 20:00:20 It shocks me how many people own cars but don’t know how to do basic maintenance like changing bulbs, checking the oil, tyre tread and refilling the engine coolant/washer fluid. BASICS bruv
2100 2018-08-09 20:00:16 Btw - should Saudi Arabia cancel  the armoured car deal with Canada #PMJT should by now, be preparing the appropriate measures to suspend oil shipments from that country, and facilitate the necessary measures to acquire alternative replacement crude #cdnpoli
2101 2018-08-09 20:00:10 Allow Technology to Progress in the Public's Eyes. 
It will allow us to break the chains of the oil cartel.
It will allow all nations to work together for a common purpose.
2102 2018-08-09 20:00:05 #chalecont92650 you are writing oil
2103 2018-08-09 20:00:02 Here at Fig & Olive, we love olive oil in all forms, especially our olive oil cake! This dessert is soaked in Moroccan syrup, and topped with blood orange dust, citrus mascarpone, and dehydrated orange.
2104 2018-08-09 19:59:35 I literally feel like I just recently got an oil change but yet here I am 
2105 2018-08-09 19:59:27 San Antonio oil and gas explorer invests in downtown Houston office
2106 2018-08-09 19:59:05 Barking on a wrong tree. Make sanctions and punish donors of perpetual regime change project for Syria oil, gas, water, land, Golan, regional power.
2107 2018-08-09 19:59:05 That makes zero sense.  What it creates is more snake oil salesmen.  We already tried that way for thousands of years.
2108 2018-08-09 19:59:01 My mom accidentally got me olive oil instead of jojoba so my broke ass been using it as tanning oil and I’m bout sick of smelling like warm zuppa tuscana
2109 2018-08-09 19:58:43 moisturize with coconut oil
2110 2018-08-09 19:58:42 Colonization crimes via Israel in Palestine & Saudis in turn being in Yemen is not right either. No double standards. Real eyes see the strategic point Yemen plays re pipelines & oil/gas flow between nations. I amicably suggest solar energy to replace oil/gas/pipelines & stop war
2111 2018-08-09 19:58:37 Coconut oil is comedogenic. Shea butter or cocoa butter is where it's at!
2112 2018-08-09 19:58:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2113 2018-08-09 19:58:26 You see Scott Moe effectively championing an NEP yesterday!? It's come full circle from sell it cheap to the Yanks & buy ME oil to boo-yah stick it to the Saudis! PM Trudeau's got them them contorting themselves in flips & flops trying to keep their web of lies & BS together.
2114 2018-08-09 19:58:19 These wars are not in the interests of citizens, theyre in the interests of bankers, big oil/gas oligarchs, arms corporations and foreign interests controlling their monetary supply & policies at home & abroad. Saudis; your prince being exploited by trump/ross in their trade war.
2115 2018-08-09 19:58:17 Cooking with oil creates some of the largest particle concentrations.  I tend to just cook what taste good and keep the vent fan on high!
2116 2018-08-09 19:58:10 -remove any previous nail polish with acetone 
-push your cuticles back and scrap any dead skin off 
-file your nails down to make them look even and a desirable length 
-NEVER CUT YOUR NAIL WITH SCISSORS  
-buff and shine your nail 
-apply jojoba oil to your whole nail
2117 2018-08-09 19:58:06 I hate the Red Sox but an Oil Can jersey would have been something.
2118 2018-08-09 19:58:02 هل تعتقد الحاصل الْيَوْمَ هو نتيجة حملة تروج للنفط الرملي الكندي من ٨ سنوات تحت شعار الزيت الاخلاقي ethical oil
2119 2018-08-09 19:57:48 That’s a great idea I’ll do the charity for a year then out of no where I’ll announce a new site promoting info I’ve taken from elsewhere and pocket the money 
2120 2018-08-09 19:57:29 Then you should understand the history of pirates.
We've been in a perpetual war & oil only mandate since 1884.
How do you propose we evolve from this mandate?
2121 2018-08-09 19:57:23 Boycott Saudi Arabia. War won’t stop, China will supply weapons instead & it’ll likely lead to another oil crisis, perhaps bigger than in 1973. But that’s what started the neoliberal revolution. Another oil crash *could* possibly be the catalyst for a social democratic revolution
2122 2018-08-09 19:57:21 Why aren’t oil and gold commodities anymore 
2123 2018-08-09 19:57:11 How much oil comes from Saudi Arabia? Perhaps we can look at alternate sources.
2124 2018-08-09 19:56:58 WTI OIL … Today I bought oil LONG at $ 66.96 and sold it at 67.35. WTI OIL is now  $ 66. 70.  On my list for Friday morning. I will buy oil long at $ 66.70 or there about, with a tight stop. @jonnajarian @jimcramer @CNBCFastMoney @CNBCFuturesNow
2125 2018-08-09 19:56:47 No it’s never ok but if some locals don’t appreciate the damage they’re causing then we shouldn’t blame them. Education is at the heart of all environmental issues. Also Western companies need to say a big fat no to palm oil usage
2126 2018-08-09 19:56:44 because Canadians saw fit to elect a PM who believes Canadian oil should stay in the ground and put the fix in to never construct a west to east pipeline
2127 2018-08-09 19:56:35 When an oil change for your new car costs $65 
2128 2018-08-09 19:56:28 That's because, their entire economy was based on oil. When the price of oil tanked so did their economy. Not a valid comparison old chap.
2129 2018-08-09 19:56:27 It does! Ethan had it! Like little granitos??? Ethan had it for a while, too. But it goes away (: I bathed him a lot. Cause supposedly it was just sweat? But I rubbed coconut oil & bathed him.
2130 2018-08-09 19:55:46 *gets call from father* 
Me: what’s up? 
Father: you check your oil recently???
Me: miss you too
2131 2018-08-09 19:55:39 I wash it wit shea moisture beard shampoo then l use palmers beard oil

2133 2018-08-09 19:55:32 You will see a girl with an amazing skin and ask what she uses, the next thing you will start hearing is I use only shea butter or coconut oil or Johnson babyoil, Vaseline, Ugh! The worst is even when they say “I only drink water” like, who exactly are you deceiving?
2134 2018-08-09 19:55:19 Daddy: I want you to rise to your feet and declare over yourself 7 times:

2136 2018-08-09 19:55:05 Dang that nappy nest lastnight I did a twist out with Cantu and coconut oil and then BOOM
2137 2018-08-09 19:54:48 Why does an oil change take more than 4 hours? I had an early appointment to avoid a long wait. And they said it's still not done. #Nissan this is unacceptable
2138 2018-08-09 19:54:48 I swearrrrr there is nothing worse than a car dealership  just change my oil and let me goooooo
2139 2018-08-09 19:54:38 Because a lot of people including myself see him as a snake oil salesman trying to appeal to the people who benefit him the most at any given time. His devisive politics and harmful stances he has taken along with the entire ongoing investigation.
2140 2018-08-09 19:54:36 @LaurensJulien @TheTotallyShow Put your money where your mouth is...I bet you 100 quid Palace don’t get relegated #CPFC p.s. I don’t like your soulless oil rich club. 
2141 2018-08-09 19:54:09 Canada should stop buyin their oil
2142 2018-08-09 19:54:07 Deputy President, William Ruto has assured members of the Turkana community that the government is committed to addressing challenges hindering exploration of oil in the area. He was speaking a day after the government signed an agreement with British oil explorer, Tullow Oil to
2143 2018-08-09 19:54:07 I use papaya soap on my face
Melted shea on my skin in winter 
Nivea+ Johnson baby oil mix in summer
2144 2018-08-09 19:54:04 That's basically what I said, Sara.
Also (allegations) that Vn oil output fell over years due to disrepair, even when Chavez was at helm.  Would take years to deteriorate slowly.
Also know of of indr sabotage by Kissinger/Nixon vs Allende, so ..?
UK is not at that risk.
2145 2018-08-09 19:54:03 Ever since I’ve dedicated at least one night a week to myself, I’ve been feeling sooo good. 

I can just do a face mask. Take an oil bath. Moisturize. Exfoliate. Deep condition. Light a candle/blunt. Drink some wine. Reflect. 

Lordddd it just feels so rejuvenating.
2146 2018-08-09 19:53:49 They can't say you didn't warn us about this snake oil con man!
2147 2018-08-09 19:53:44 Didn't Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan attack I srael all at once? And get hammered. Arabs are slow to learn anything about Israel or the West. Luckily some of them have oil or they would all be bombed into the stone-age.
2148 2018-08-09 19:53:20 We should stop buying Saudi oil and get our oil from Alberta....build the  east/west pipeline!
2149 2018-08-09 19:53:12 finally got that oil change done... but my credit is gonna be mad af
2150 2018-08-09 19:52:49 Deputy President assures members of Turkana community of 5% oil revenue
2151 2018-08-09 19:52:47 this might be an unpopular opinion but paleo baked goods arent any healthier than regular ones like... porter's family half complains when i make something not paleo but honestly even if i did it would be 2/3 fat because of all the oil they make you use
2152 2018-08-09 19:52:40 You forgot that the Oil Can Harry admin is also bringing asbestos back. The first A in MAGA is asbestos, direct from Putinville.
2153 2018-08-09 19:52:40 Mtn rice( palm oil) is life 
2154 2018-08-09 19:52:28 Cancel Saudi oil imports to the east coast... 300mln to put back into our own economy. We have our own sufficient resources here. #cdnpoli
2155 2018-08-09 19:52:27 A9  Keep up with the maintenance.  Do as much as you can yourself.  Oil changes, tire rotations etc. #wbchat

2157 2018-08-09 19:52:12 It is time to get fresh oil. Get over the treachery, the betrayal…

You must know the difference between the enjoyable and the endurable

We need patience to let Faith work
We need longsuffering in dealing with men
We need endurance in dealing with the devil.

2161 2018-08-09 19:51:51 Michele --

Recently, @HSBC made a decision to no longer supply financing to new Canadian oil sands projects and pipelines.

Last week, we launched our letter writing campaign asking that HSBC reverse their decision.

And Canadians came out in a big way. They know that Canada’s
2162 2018-08-09 19:51:47 @Lanora_5 I think we should be giving Jared some advice on oil control before we give him and other ideas. We don’t need him burning down cornfields
2163 2018-08-09 19:51:39 Well, grease IS the word!  (These days I prefer coconut oil...)
2164 2018-08-09 19:51:32 We can thank republicans for oil & $ wars, the highest deficit in history, the worsening of our air and water quality, trophy hunting, cutting back on veteran housing aid & medical care, empowering racists & rapist,  & helping the dumbest billionare in the usa become president.
2165 2018-08-09 19:51:30 Grapeseed oil, vitamin e, and witch hazel have brought my face back from the dead, I am forever thankful.
2166 2018-08-09 19:51:15 I have no clue though it just seems literally impossible to me that they can charge me 50 bucks an ounce and it's fine. no other place has done that, ever! And the oil I was telling yall about too.
2167 2018-08-09 19:51:15 I’m annoyed bc I shaved my legs and put body oil on and perfume, and got dressed today and James isn’t home to appreciate at it 
2168 2018-08-09 19:51:13 MCT oil is tasteless honestly. The sweetness will come from whatever type of syrup your using. I usually use the Sugar Free Torani syrups. I can’t do plain coffee.
2169 2018-08-09 19:51:09 Hello! V glad you’re enjoying the book! So, it’s because tahini can get weirdly claggy and ‘seize’ up when you add the lemon juice & oil - try it without adding any water, then add the water one tablespoon at a time and you’ll find it magically lightens it up to a dressing 1/2
2170 2018-08-09 19:51:07 a what --  protect candy pow land --- unleash Panzer fire on saudi arabia take saudi oil of the market --- to get back the losses --- shure ---

2172 2018-08-09 19:51:06 I was hospitalized for stomach ulcers like two years ago. Stay away from spice and acid when you’re sensitive and opt for stuff with olive oil and an avocado a day!
2173 2018-08-09 19:50:57 In light of the Saudi embargoes on our Canadian agricultural products maybe it time for the PM to put embargoes on Saudi oil coming into Canada
2174 2018-08-09 19:50:53 Why do we place so much emphasis on spiritual fathers and mothers. We neglect the weightier matters of ministry in the process. 
The mandate is not "receiving oil from a father's mantle." The mandate is CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED.

2176 2018-08-09 19:50:35 I suggest checking out a STS operation that caught my eye today. The vessel Gulf Glow III loading at oil terminal in a Bandar Abbas and then appearing to discharge into the bunker barge Mistral A off Khor Fakkan. The latter then bunkering vessels with product of Iranian origin.
2177 2018-08-09 19:50:33 Hoy hable con el gerente de un YPF Directo, me conto q no hay gas oil para el agro y transporte. Las privadas no destilan xq "no les conviene a este precio", YPF produce lo mismo de siempre y es insuficiente. ¿Habrá corte de rutas? chan!
2178 2018-08-09 19:50:33 No the oil industry is not needed if we use renewable energy and electricity. Plus we will run out of oil at some point.

2180 2018-08-09 19:50:24 Republicans have completely ignored climate change and selling American land for cheap to those who will dig for oil money putting the rest of us in danger of the health effects, like in West Virginia (coal) and many other rural places
2181 2018-08-09 19:50:21 Getting an oil change.. and I know they’re gonna come out here telling me I need brakes  and ima tell them “sure if they’re free ”
2182 2018-08-09 19:50:17 I was yesterday years old whenever I found out that fracing and being in the oil rig isn’t the same thing
2183 2018-08-09 19:50:12 Lets not forget the reason changed from being an oil shill to genuine concern that MS was writing and tweeting while on company time.

2191 2018-08-09 19:49:11 Ladies please recommend your skincare products if you have a dry skin.

my face has been peeling for some days now.. I only use Dudu osun soap, cocoa butter lotion & any body oil(using the hibiscus oil right now) but I think my skin doesn’t like them anymore  ; I exfoliate too
2192 2018-08-09 19:49:03 If the left had not blocked the pipeline east, Canada would not need Saudi oil.
2193 2018-08-09 19:49:01 Just bring plenty of oil 
2194 2018-08-09 19:48:55 I wouldn’t expect anything less - business side of oil and gas or switching industries?
2195 2018-08-09 19:48:44 The truth must not be exposed is what you're really saying.
2196 2018-08-09 19:48:34 Maybe the workers need to find a better customer for their product than medieval #SaudiArabia oil barons incapable of managing their own state without beheadings, crucifixions, and cruel subordination of their women
2197 2018-08-09 19:48:30 I’m sitting in a gas station waiting on my oil change. No kids. This is what freedom feels like.
2198 2018-08-09 19:48:28 How do they work against our interest? They provide us with a steady supply of oil and oppose Iran and oppose the Moslem Brotherhood and other Islamic organizations.
2199 2018-08-09 19:48:23 I don't see how he's any different than any other self-actualization snake oil guru.  It's just est for guys who are afraid to date.
2200 2018-08-09 19:48:15 Step 1: invest in alternative energy sources

Step 2: vastly reduce dependence on foreign oil

Step 3: increase diplomatic efforts and strengthen alliances with better regional partners

Step 4: tell Saudi Arabia to go fuck itself
2201 2018-08-09 19:48:05 Sadly glades was done in a bit by the recession, even the virgin megastores gone now. Then it got bought out and renamed intu, and renamed back when they sold it to alaskas oil fund lol
2202 2018-08-09 19:47:47 Can you use bacon grease instead of cooking oil?

2206 2018-08-09 19:47:28 Randall, will you please post the link to order the SCT Oil here?  Thank you!
2207 2018-08-09 19:47:25 Lower oil prices have a double edge sword. Lower prices mean a higher ratings. Not good for November. After the Nov, prices rise.
2208 2018-08-09 19:47:22 That's saying something cuz there gave been many, many, many oil sands subsidies...

2209 2018-08-09 19:47:20 Jeez, really? Sure. Thank you so much for the info. But, lately my skin is getting better from my severe breakouts because of a skincare allergies. Im using the tea tree oil for only the big bumps it shrink and dries the next day. I'll try for accutane soon.
2210 2018-08-09 19:47:13 Yea, that is true, but do you know that Seed Oil is 20 times more potent than fruits?
So if you still have not seen results you should try our SoPlus and SoCollagen Seed Oil drink daily for  better results!

2216 2018-08-09 19:46:33 Ppl from the culinary interweb I have a question. I was going to make hummus, but the pot of tahini that has been in my cupboard has turned to the consistency of chewing gum withba layer of oil. Is that a problem?
2217 2018-08-09 19:46:30 We don’t need their oil.
2218 2018-08-09 19:46:17 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
2219 2018-08-09 19:46:09 Spend it and get our oil moving!  If it’s not spent here he will just give the money to some foreign country to get his picture in the paper
2220 2018-08-09 19:46:03 My mom used to give me those after giving me Castor oil 
2221 2018-08-09 19:46:03 It’s a type of fat that comes from Coconut oil. It’s said to be better tho and have some health benefits. I don’t use it all the time because if you have too much it’ll fuck with your stomach.
2222 2018-08-09 19:46:01 I think the time is ripe for spineless #trump to capture Saudi barbaria and control global oil and resettle refugees that have gone amok in EU!
2223 2018-08-09 19:45:55 Jamaican Castro oil, lots of water, protective hair style, no heat, deep conditions like once a month.. stay away from shampoo. Oil your scalp like a motha
2224 2018-08-09 19:45:45 Why are we buying oil from cave man
2225 2018-08-09 19:45:39 If i break ur heart na oil spillage!
2226 2018-08-09 19:45:29 HWAT AM I DOING IN ABBOTSFORD DO PEOPLE HAVE INTERNET HERE
HWERE DO I FIND THE NEAREST HOLISTIC OIL DIFFUSER STORE
2227 2018-08-09 19:45:25 100% the worst part of my job is being verbally abused by parents who come to north dakota to make oil money and then get FURIOUS when they learn their kids aren't old enough to go to kindergarten here
2228 2018-08-09 19:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2229 2018-08-09 19:44:50 Let them crawl back into the sand when their oil runs out.
2230 2018-08-09 19:44:43 Oil be blowed.
2231 2018-08-09 19:44:29 I need buy a oil pen ASAP
2232 2018-08-09 19:44:27 As one who is #ActuallyAutistic I agree. She is just as bad as a snake oil salesmen!
2233 2018-08-09 19:44:23 It might be the best experience you've ever had, BUT, I'mma tell you a less painful way: Oil up the butt
2234 2018-08-09 19:44:10 If it doesn’t make sense then it is ? You want a pipeline so we can export our oil so we don’t have to import oil  we on the same pipe here(where is the BC Bud icon?)
2235 2018-08-09 19:43:59 Anoshata. Imagine machunks, without the oil and seasoning and hard af!
2236 2018-08-09 19:43:54 Can someone tell this idiot that Islam is a peaceful religion? Can someone also let this condemned oil know that @MBuhari is nothing  but a blind Muslim because he has chosen to be. He's a jihadist. Not all Muslims are like him.
2237 2018-08-09 19:43:43 Boy you look like penzoil high mileage vehicle motor oil with active cleansing agents.
2238 2018-08-09 19:43:38 The mechanic at my job came in all stoned today and was asking me when  was the last time I had changed the oil in the forklift and I had to remind him that it was his job.
2239 2018-08-09 19:43:34 My pa will make greens and will drown it in red oil... my twest 
2240 2018-08-09 19:43:33 Hi, I am super clumsy. It is hot here so I thought I'd put a drop of peppermint oil on the back of my neck. Approximately 1/2 the bottle of pure peppermint oil came out. The back of my neck, well into my hairline, burns with a cool fire. Still.  What a maroon.
2241 2018-08-09 19:43:33 Found out I'm allergic to bottle of oil
2242 2018-08-09 19:43:31 Oooo be careful with tea tree oil! It can be harmful on sensitive skin :( it used to break me out a lot
2243 2018-08-09 19:43:30 In other words I think we agree - my point is more that new energy technologies also rely on political and government support. The failure by proponents to invest in alternatives during the 1970s oil crisis helped set stage for absence of alternative tech in 1980s.
2244 2018-08-09 19:43:21 Giovanni is a  geological technician that likes Olive oil on their mushroom pizza with champagne
2245 2018-08-09 19:43:20 "5 A’s of Mistake Making:
1. Be aware you made it 2. Acknowledge it 3. Apologize 4. Act on it 5. Apply additional generosity" @dhmeyer Gave great example of olive oil spilling down the back of a CK dress! #Ooops #GLS18
2246 2018-08-09 19:43:16 tbh it's pretty shoddy, I have way too much excess petroleum and not enough lubricant, I need to fix my oil setup badly (spent like 4 friggin hours on it yesterday).

I'll stream tonight if I have time
2247 2018-08-09 19:43:11 its 2018 and yall think coconut oil is a moisturizer??????
2248 2018-08-09 19:42:56 It may rise, but if Saudi oil imports are impacted it will be short term because the cost to central and east coast taxpayers when they have to pay an arm and a leg for last minute fuel substitutes for their cars and homes will hurt.
#TrudeauMustGo
2249 2018-08-09 19:42:51 Haven’t made tempura shrimp is years all I want is to finish with no oil burns 
2250 2018-08-09 19:42:41 Meh.  Most of Canadas oil comes from the US.  Of need be we can just purchase from them.  Price is comparable to SA.  As to why we dont use our own.  We harvest a different product completely than what we import.
2251 2018-08-09 19:42:36 Coconut Oil is the best Discovery by Humans so far..  #BlackGirlChronicles
2252 2018-08-09 19:42:33 You know we are still importing oil from them and have no plans to stop. Feminist and Canadian values meet two faced Trudeau and government.
2253 2018-08-09 19:42:19 Oil of every pearls un-insides/ Steven Universe. Do it bitch you won’t regret it
2254 2018-08-09 19:42:13 the guy who sold me my car told me he would email me oil change coupons. it’s been almost a year & still nothing. I feel very swindled.

2256 2018-08-09 19:41:55 It’s all that red oil
2257 2018-08-09 19:41:52 I am certain...most of us conservative leaning can discern that David Duke and their ilk are Blah, blah blah..just like the far left loons.  They have free speech..we have the right to discern what is snake oil.
2258 2018-08-09 19:41:29 Heard there's oil there, better start packing!
2259 2018-08-09 19:41:23 I need someone to help me use up this baby oil . 
2260 2018-08-09 19:41:21 Awhh. Thankiss for the reply! Im using tea tree oil rn. I'll try to look up for accutane soon 
2261 2018-08-09 19:41:16 I’m really happy I stopped buying all those expensive natural hair care stuff (except my ginger rinse and conditioner, that shit expensive af) the best thing for my hair is water, coconut oil or grape seed oil, tea tree oil for my scalp, and shea butter
2262 2018-08-09 19:40:56 Not surprising really.  Israel does what Trump says, and Trump does what the US oil industry says.  @BBCNews won't stand up to that lot.
2263 2018-08-09 19:40:35 Twitter provide oil, come through it might be petrol for your car 
2264 2018-08-09 19:40:31 Well, there wouldn’t be another side if college was um *clears throat* publicly free and federally funded, but you know, bombing innocent civilians and “spreading democracy” for that sweet, sweet oil is more important lol jk
2265 2018-08-09 19:40:29 Give this people boreholes and schools. We want to see more Turkana leaders in the near future ..its a beautiful place for tourist destination and not forgetting the oil...dont take all their resources and leave them poor and dry again
2266 2018-08-09 19:40:26 New tires, oil change, my bank account. Damn Claudia can you not?!
2267 2018-08-09 19:40:20 Does anyone still really use oil based on woodwork ... Get in the 21st century chaps!?!
2268 2018-08-09 19:40:17 There’s oil on Mars and America needs it
2269 2018-08-09 19:40:16 Think of the economy as of big oil tanker they need a mile to come to a stop. The prices are going up and the deficit needs to be finance so higher interest rates are coming. It's good when you have money in the bank but if you live pay to pay watch out.
2270 2018-08-09 19:40:12 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2271 2018-08-09 19:40:11 I do. But also have dermatillomania. Currently trying to use bio oil to reduce scarring.
2272 2018-08-09 19:40:10 I think it's leaking oil. 기름이 새는 것 같아요.
2273 2018-08-09 19:40:05 even if you like drink oil the hotness will still be there
2274 2018-08-09 19:40:03 kwentuhan muna tayo: 

While im writing my term papers , nakaamoy ako ng efficasent oil tinignan ko yung kwarto namin wala namang may hawak na efficasent oil so I realized na amoy pala ni mama yun . thanks Ma sa pagbabantay sakin ng mga gantong oras .dabest ka kahit anjan kana 
2275 2018-08-09 19:40:01 No we don't. There are other suppliers happy to accommodate, while Canada works out their politics over it's own oil. #SayNoToSaudiOil and start relying on our own resources.  #IStandWithCanada 
2276 2018-08-09 19:39:56 Girl vitamin E oil, but not the kind from the pills tho, that helps with dryness and it makes pimples go away!! Doesn’t make your face produce more oil too so it doesn’t fuck up your ph levels
2277 2018-08-09 19:39:43 Do you not rely on petroleum products in every day life? To get to work, groceries at the store get there by truck, etc. Its a way for canada to be self sufficient without relying on other countries for oil.
2278 2018-08-09 19:39:39 WANT TO KNOW THAT PROCEDURE OF TO BECOME A

WE ARE SUBSIDIARY OF NIGERIA NATIONAL PETRO CORP 
FOR SELLING BONNY LIGHT CRUDE OIL WORLDWIDE.
2279 2018-08-09 19:39:35 If it was all orchestrated, it was orchestrated horribly. First time I've *ever* seen "subsided oil sands" lead to alienated Albertans.
2280 2018-08-09 19:39:17 ...when a brother compares ''breaking a ladies' heart" to "oil spillage", just knw you're dealing with a Niger-deltan! @duncan_n_mighty

2282 2018-08-09 19:39:01 What gurl this is oil found in a third world defenseless country.. if there is one thing out gov will agree on is free oil. They will steal that oil and no one will know for about 6-10 years
2283 2018-08-09 19:38:56 I worked in Harvard Square... when it was the land of earth shoes (mine were blue suede) patchouli oil and Hare Krishna.

2284 2018-08-09 19:38:56 It shouldn’t take this long for an oil change bruh
2285 2018-08-09 19:38:52 Worried about big oil and dems? Explain why trump picked the Exxon chair to be sec of state. GFY... rubles support Greenies
2286 2018-08-09 19:38:24 
2287 2018-08-09 19:38:23 person: *doesnt fucking educate herself about essential oils and what they could do to her pet, thus poisoning her dog with tea tree oil* please don't condemn me as a bad dog mommy
2288 2018-08-09 19:37:59 "'If a man carries meat that is holy in the fold of his garment, and he touches bread, or cooked food, or wine, or oil, or any food with this fold, does what he touches become holy '" And the priests answered, "No!" [Holiness is not transferrable.]" — Hag 2:12
2289 2018-08-09 19:37:50 Probably not. Trump has properties in Saudi Arabia, and Saudis don't want Iran having nukes. In fact, they don't want Iranian oil on the world market. It's not the Obama deal - it's Trump being bought by the Saudis and other Arab nations in addition to the Russians.
2290 2018-08-09 19:37:48 Coriander seeds, since I have discovered them my cooking gone to another level. Try it! Burn in oil of your choice! Exhilarating!
2291 2018-08-09 19:37:44 Could it be ---- rename the airport in Montreal to the ---  WESTERN CANADIAN OIL ---- sounds better than it's present name  ---
2292 2018-08-09 19:37:42 How many oil pipelines failed to make money?
2293 2018-08-09 19:37:40 Well yeah! 99.99% of supplements for “mental health” or “brain health” r simply snake oil. Not worth ur $$. Doesn’t stop the big market for them, ppl believing that will help.
2294 2018-08-09 19:37:38 I’ve got a load of 0w-40 oil if anyone needs some, £7 a litre!
2295 2018-08-09 19:37:13 @JustinTrudeau cut off imports of Oil from Saudi Arabia. We dont need to purchase anything from them. @CBC @CTVNationalNews
2296 2018-08-09 19:37:03 I've been using black seed oil. Helps with any sort of inflammation. Good luck 
2297 2018-08-09 19:36:59 Here's the boring "mom voice" answer: rinse your hands in olive oil then soap and water.
2298 2018-08-09 19:36:55 I keep saying I'm gonna oil my scalp but I'm lazy & don't want my hands to be all greasy.

2304 2018-08-09 19:36:30 I had a conversation with @clivesimpkins recently about the temperature at which coconut oil melts and solidifies. This tweet reminded me of our conversation. So I sent him a copy of the tweet.
2305 2018-08-09 19:36:27 a4: on our jeep, we do our own oil changes (and mods!) #WBChat
2306 2018-08-09 19:36:23 Of course; had the right not declared literal war on organized labor as in unionized coal miners a century ago, we'd very possibly currently be seeing socialist rejection of abandonment of fossil fuels in league with the coal and oil corporations.
2307 2018-08-09 19:36:22 I am a fan of Elon’s vision but he may have over stepped even his own stride. But, I’ve always thought $TSLA would be a significant part of a broader conspiracy to derail oil independence. True or not, Elon is a player that has potential to change the landscape of the game
2308 2018-08-09 19:36:06 Possibly but big tobacco just pushed it in Asia and Africa. It wasn't like knowing their product would kill millions changed their business plan. Same with big oil. Knowing that their product would destroy civilization had no impact on their decision making.
2309 2018-08-09 19:36:05 a4: Find coupons for oil changes and tire rotations. Usually it's cheaper to go to the dealership for those. #WBChat
2310 2018-08-09 19:36:03 The National Interest Online (blog) US selling more oil to India, Iran's biggest customer WorldOil NEW DELHI (Bloomberg) -- One of Iran's biggest oil customers is buying more U.S. crude as President Donald Trump sticks to his pledge to squeeze the Persian Gulf nation's energy…
2311 2018-08-09 19:35:50 Burning the midnight oil.....
2312 2018-08-09 19:35:46 Do you mean like say Iran? That would be due to the overthrow of the democratically elected secular government by the US and UK in 1953. This was done due to the fact Iran had nationalised their Oil fields.
2313 2018-08-09 19:35:45 We shouldn't even buy from them when we have clean oil from Alberta
2314 2018-08-09 19:35:40 Completely hysterical -‘curried oil and shut-faced rice’ love it!
2315 2018-08-09 19:35:39 black coffee tastes like motor oil
2316 2018-08-09 19:35:26 WRONG!!! Canada doesn’t need it Ontario and Quebec need it. Shut off Saudi Oil now and the east can live with their lack of foresight and Canadian oil. @JustinTrudeau #cdnpoli
2317 2018-08-09 19:35:24 It works for a while but don’t let your face get use to it, cause your face is going to start producing more oil due to the coconut oil and it clogs pores and trust me on this one I learned the hard way 
2318 2018-08-09 19:35:21 Which kind of place should I get my oil changed at
2319 2018-08-09 19:35:17 I’m mad lmfao I look like a mechanic all full of oil & I’m wearing white pants
2320 2018-08-09 19:35:09 If your currency is based off of what you can put behind it diamonds gold oil minerals why is Africa currency so low
2321 2018-08-09 19:35:08 Smoke and mirrors.  This is as real as the tooth fairy or the Easter Bunny.  You are selling snake oil to the people of Ontario.  When it costs far more than a dollar to even make one bottle of beer, you are expecting brewers to lose money on their product. #greateconomicplan
2322 2018-08-09 19:35:06 The Euro-dominionist rapacious consumption and transformation of fossil fuels (especially oil, but also coal) is one of the worst thing that has happened to life on this planet.
2323 2018-08-09 19:35:05 @DBChirpy this is bs. California Water is used for California big agriculture.  Cutting down forests for oil doesn’t save one drop of water.
2324 2018-08-09 19:35:02 Similar to the Non GMO Project and RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil), is there a third party entity that has developed a set of standards around claims for "sustainable" clothing? @EcoWarrPrincess
2325 2018-08-09 19:34:52 Other thing we eat a lot: dehydrated split pea soup mix, whole wheat couscous, dehydrated veg (as much as you can get), nutritional yeast, olive oil. Texture/color: 0/10, taste: 9/10.
2326 2018-08-09 19:34:46 Well I m partially agree with that part Saudis use money in illegitimate purpose...
But that money come from oil and it has nothing to do with Hajj
2327 2018-08-09 19:34:39 KP, if you were curious, is essentially like having goosebumps. ALL THE TIME. Most commonly on the arms/legs. Mine is on my upper arms, and pretty mild, but very annoying. So finding that oil is literally like winning the soft skin lottery. Thank you @chrissyteigen 
2328 2018-08-09 19:34:30 TRUDEAU: STOP BUYING SAUDI OIL, STOP SUPPLYING THEM WITH ARMS TO KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN, BUY BACK OUR WHEAT BOARD, CUT ALL DEALINGS WITH SAUDI ARABIA!!
2329 2018-08-09 19:34:18 I saw the video.  Ann Coulter says immigrants post-1970s are here to smooch of the welfare system and Ana Kasparian says the real smoochers are the oil companies.  They are both wrong!  Look up the Horseshoe Theory.  The far-left and the far-right are one and the same. Sad!
2330 2018-08-09 19:34:17 Positive news. Things r settling down. SA needs us to buy their oil. It’s all good. Hope this eases ur worries. 
2331 2018-08-09 19:34:14 $OXY and its management are the most underrated in Oil and Gas. They have been outstanding sellers of assets, and that's one of the higher compliments I think I can pay to a company.

2336 2018-08-09 19:33:38 First way tea tree oil  
1-combine one part tea tree oil with nine parts of water 
2-dip cotton swab into the mixtures and apply directly on pimples 
3-apply moisturizer (If needed) 
4-repeat the process 2 or 3 times a day if needed
2337 2018-08-09 19:33:36 I read that you could put it on your face if you wet a washcloth with hot water and wipe off the oil soon after applying it, thoughts?
2338 2018-08-09 19:33:32 yeah will appreciate this masterpiece or we'll set leah on you with extra virgin oil
2339 2018-08-09 19:33:24 Texas economy is strong with plant jobs and oil coming back strong. Don’t hassle Ted he’s going to keep it rolling. Beto would be the death to it all 
2340 2018-08-09 19:33:16 Suspect that Saudi oil interests prevailed with entire Bush family.

2349 2018-08-09 19:32:31 Time to break um up same as we did standard oil in the 1900
2350 2018-08-09 19:32:21 Well you see, a lot of powerful and influential people did very well in that invasion: liberating all that gold, controlling the flow of oil, & the revenue streams from the collateral damage as civilians were displaced & the present slave trade in Libya got a big kick off.

2352 2018-08-09 19:31:52 I've done a painting and I found an oil brush that I like so I painted just using that and now I'm in a Pit of Regret bc I didn't use my nice textured brushes and now it looks so digital and I hate it
2353 2018-08-09 19:31:36 That was painful.
2354 2018-08-09 19:31:32 Awww that's so sweet. I still have a long way to go but I swear by @BahiCosmetics oil cleanser. It really helped with my texture cause I used to have mad comedones. I then wash with their milk cleanser or one of their bar soaps.
2355 2018-08-09 19:31:18 Please also request development from the federal government. Disappointing how previous gov have treated balochistan. Also requests regarding the missing ppl. Jobs going to local ppl. Maybe tax reliefs given to companies opening in Balochistan? Plz also look for oil!!!!
2356 2018-08-09 19:31:13 Oh my fucking god... the scam ads are getting worse by the day. I am only getting weird snake oil wonder foods and pills or shady trading scams as video ads on YouTube.
2357 2018-08-09 19:31:12 The robber barons of the 21st Century- woud have a lot to discuss with mill owners and oil barons
2358 2018-08-09 19:31:10 Shocked that governments haven't issued their support.

Believe it with US as DT in hock to Saudi, but others should stand up.

Although with all the human rights abuses by SA, no one has stood up to them.

But wait until they run out of oil! Too late then for those suffering now
2359 2018-08-09 19:31:05 Let us not miss that Elon and his cult doxxed Montana Skeptic for being a Big Oil schill when Elon knew Saudi Arabia was adding a large TSLA position. @TeslaCharts @ContrarianShort @markbspiegel

2362 2018-08-09 19:30:51 The only way to topple the Iranian regime is to shut down their oil exports... totally!!!
2363 2018-08-09 19:30:37 Was complaining of a headache and my work wife is like "dude try this CBD oil" my immediate response was "I'm scared" and she's like "dude you smoke!" She's totally right Plus on lunch I had an edible 
2364 2018-08-09 19:30:36 Pedro, el combustoleo es un residuo de la refinación, es el combustible más pesado, en algunos países se le llama fuel oil, en otro puede ser heavy oil, según su peso específico. Las gasolinas no son combustoleo.

2369 2018-08-09 19:30:21 HAVE YOU CONSIDERED A FUEL CARD? 

Fuel prices : The price at the pump fluctuates based on the cost of oil.

2372 2018-08-09 19:29:55 Is he trained to use those tools?
2373 2018-08-09 19:29:47 Coco oil! Love it! And argan oil for my lashes.
2374 2018-08-09 19:29:46 if you do prove ETs exist, the first thing Harvard and Stanford physics guys are gonna ask, “Well, how the heck did they get here? They didn't use gas, coal and oil.”
Corey: Yeah, the greatest classification in the land is not that there are ETs. It's how they got here.
2375 2018-08-09 19:29:42 Been unplugged in the North for the last few days.  That #buckabeer was something else.  @OntarioPCParty and @fordnation are nothing but snake oil salespeople.  A page out of Trump’s playbook.  A sleight of hand to distract from the other cuts.  #notmypremier
2376 2018-08-09 19:29:40 So we still get buy dirty oil from a horrid country...
2377 2018-08-09 19:29:26 Vetiver oil works gets you there. Very earthy aroma but divine.
2378 2018-08-09 19:29:15 Whale oil and coal or bust! Lol
2379 2018-08-09 19:29:14 Ok but in all seriousness, the body oil from @chrissyteigen and #becca has helped reduce the KP (keratosis pilaris) on my arms DRASTICALLY and I would love to get more but it’s always sold out! I wanna get some for my sissy @twittysuch too.
2380 2018-08-09 19:28:46 @TOAdamVaughan  Just a question - am I a ‘xenophobic racist’ for calling for an end to all KSA oil imports? What’s the term for people like you who kiss the arse of a regime that bombs school buses? Asking for a friend...
2381 2018-08-09 19:28:46 “Ok 2 danishes a bear claw and a quart of motor oil, is that everything?”
2382 2018-08-09 19:28:46 Coconut oil + H2o
2383 2018-08-09 19:28:43 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
2384 2018-08-09 19:28:18 Seeing what Qatar, United Arab Emirates do with their oil money makes me wonder what Nigeria and Ghana are selling. coconut oil?
2385 2018-08-09 19:28:09 Precios del productor que es un componete importante para predecir la inflacion vino flojisimo. Eso va de la mano con el Oil desinflandose. El dolar alto hace estragos.
2386 2018-08-09 19:28:07 I said no, but that’s cuz I like thin French fries.  The thicker they are the more potatoe-y they taste imo.  And the thinner the more they sort just taste like salty oil.
2387 2018-08-09 19:28:05 Licin gila kulit bila picit keluar semua white head, tak sabar nak tunggu tea tree oil sampai. Time to recover the skin 
2388 2018-08-09 19:28:05 Wow, used to live OK & anyone could find a job if not afraid of some manual labor. Forgot about how those oil rigs used to be part of my everyday scenery. Worked at Del Monte for a bit, guess who worked the fields & who worked indoors. Takin jobs... Shit
2389 2018-08-09 19:28:05 ya know you can do it just for charity.. I can donate $50 in your name to the Saudi Jawboning Fund..if you are a Shia I can donate it to the Iran Jawboning Fund:)

2391 2018-08-09 19:28:04 250 for 2 hours should do it.. does around low elevation anyway. easier to just boil it in a closed jar with cooking oil.. no smell whatsoever
2392 2018-08-09 19:27:54 Ford is worth $11- $12, actually makes money.
Tesla?
2393 2018-08-09 19:27:42 Haha.
2394 2018-08-09 19:27:30 You are going to reject "bulk comments" from green organizations but give special attention to coal-oil-gas insider comments as you did with Utah Monuments. Once again an anti-conservation phony TR Republican.
2395 2018-08-09 19:27:26 Canada doesn’t need to buy oil. They have plenty. It’s a political game
2396 2018-08-09 19:27:22 Iwe Kazembe Kazembe you need anointing oil ne Holy water neDoom zvese. 
2397 2018-08-09 19:27:19 When you’re getting your oil changed and they show you the stick at the end and you just nod and say thank you bc you have no idea what you’re looking at 
2398 2018-08-09 19:27:06 @JohnGormleyShow shouldn’t all Canadians be demanding that @JustinTrudeau put an end to oil imports from SA?  Social justice warriors because of the human rights issue. Us crazy right wingers because we believe that refining our own oil is the right thing to do.

2403 2018-08-09 19:26:47 Sooo I actually put them in a cast iron with a little olive oil and then finishing them in the sauce for an hour

2406 2018-08-09 19:26:34 Yeah, recently I've just been buying Costco sized Coconut oil and bobbing for apples in it till I feel like my hair is soft enough. It's not a very fun game. =(
2407 2018-08-09 19:26:28 They need to drill for oil in tRumps golf courses. Light em up!!!

2413 2018-08-09 19:25:42 3 questions for you bill. How much does Scotland receive under the block Grant from WM? How much of Scotland's remaining oil is burnable without impacting climate change? What terms of membership has been offered by EU to independent Scotland?
2414 2018-08-09 19:25:37 A4 Learn to do simple maintenance yourself, changing oil and most fluids is super simple #WBChat
2415 2018-08-09 19:25:37 oil is at 66-67 for 
a barrel. year end
is expected to increase
to seventy.. cnbc
2416 2018-08-09 19:25:33 Yet they are still selling oil to us and Canada is still buying the oil
  This is just smoke and mirrors if either side was actually serious would that still be happening?
2417 2018-08-09 19:25:15 Slice the leaves on both sides of the spine, then roll up the sliced portions. Slice those rolls into smaller pieces, perhaps a quarter of an inch thick. Toss them into a cast iron pan with just a little olive oil. Squeeze lemon juice over while cooking. 20-25 minutes.
2418 2018-08-09 19:25:15 What was worse than that was Bush2 let the World Trade center be destroyed & the cost of a revenge on Osama Bin Laden over something that didn't upset him.  That price tag was about 2.5 Trillion & the Bush family still has oil fields in the Middle East. Debt was near 0 prior.
2419 2018-08-09 19:25:06 All of a sudden Canada is all in about human rights in Saudi ? Virtue signalling at its best You didn’t care in 2014 when you sold them $15 billion of Canadian arms Does it come up when you buy their oil?They are your 2nd largest trading partner in Mid East They haven’t changed

2422 2018-08-09 19:24:53 My grandma would cover her palette with paint left on it with cling wrap then put it in the freezer to save it for another day.  I'm not sure that's what you should do with oil paint, but maybe it does help stretch out the uses.

The client had no lawyer & was fighting an oil company. 

We won. So that’s awfully nice.

2427 2018-08-09 19:24:27 My uncle worked at Sun Oil and had asbestos in his lungs, my father worked there and died of lung cancer at 47. This man is evil and a danger to our planet and all who live on it.

2431 2018-08-09 19:24:15 just bought 3 stocks for the #OGIB portfolio--including two #oil producers who are growing so fast...and paying out their well cost so quick...the Market isn't pricing any of it in...of course, it's not pricing much in #energyland - and my first OFS stock in a long time
2432 2018-08-09 19:24:06 Mix in six pounds of olive oil then stir vigorously.

2435 2018-08-09 19:23:17 @JustinTrudeau is a facade. He is spending $20 billion of taxpayers money on #Transmountainpipeline This will destroy Vancouver. 7X more oil tankers on Vancouver shores. Bad economics too!!

2437 2018-08-09 19:23:01 @Dominos_UK your menu is too confusing ... Just to get chilli oil, why only on italiano pizza and not Italian base  
how come one week you get 1 bit of smoked bacon on a slice but this week it's covered 
Why's my red onion always burnt 
2438 2018-08-09 19:22:58 Because he’s ungrateful. Alberta has some of the most lenient alcohol prices, cheap weed, rly low taxes in comparison, great social services, and great education and job opportunities in the oil and gas industry and in trades. BC is a political mess but it’s also awesome
2439 2018-08-09 19:22:58 There is no way Canada should be importing any oil at all. We need a National Energy policy that stipulates no oil exports until domestic needs are met first!
2440 2018-08-09 19:22:56 They've earned it you got it from oil money.
2441 2018-08-09 19:22:56 The price is much different.  Spectrum Yellow Oil from Tweed will cost you $90 for 40ml bottle w/ 20mg/ml of cbd.  So 800mgs of CBD for $90.  A savings but not much.  Expect the price to come way down when outdoor grows flourish.
2442 2018-08-09 19:22:48 There’s competition @MSNBC  with capitalism moving into space .  Just like oil In Alaska!  Can’t we work on getting along ?
2443 2018-08-09 19:22:42 I wish they would legalize it here in Wi. I need it for my anxiety and pain. We have CBD oil with no thc. It helps but not on the level I need it
2444 2018-08-09 19:22:41 Say good by and cut all ties as they want to hurt us by cutting paying programs but not oil as it pays them  and never the weapons and military hardware they need  they can’t have it there way now. They started this now Canada finish it.

Ok I’m done.
2449 2018-08-09 19:22:18 I winged it. Vinegar, Dijon, hot sauce, little bit of red boat, oil, sesame seeds, capers, every seasoning... all my ratios are off

2451 2018-08-09 19:21:54 As we may be moving away from dependency upon silky Arabian oil, & onto the challenges of Western oil, tar sands & pipelines. Nuclear will be an essential partner. I'm not sold on it being clean, nor in the due diligence of 10 yr. contracts, 4 Waste may outlive humanity.
2452 2018-08-09 19:21:42 Does anyone know: what is this cannabis oil stuff I get notices for in email, does anyone know? WTF do i want cannabis oil for? How about some good Hash Hish. Seriously does anyone know?
2453 2018-08-09 19:21:40 Then I use diluted tea tree oil to help with pimples (but I haven’t noticed a difference yet idk y)
2454 2018-08-09 19:21:32 With greater reserves than Saudi's, we really don't need their oil.
2455 2018-08-09 19:21:31 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2456 2018-08-09 19:21:31 Dr Oz is a snake oil salesman. Nothing more.
2457 2018-08-09 19:21:18 Agree.

This sums it up:

Saudi: We’re pulling all our citizens, money and investment out of Canada!

Canada: GOOD! Go ahead we don’t want your stinkin blood oil anyways!

Saudi: Oh except oil. You can keep buying that.

Canada: And we will!!

2472 2018-08-09 19:19:48 Eventually oil in these countries will run out when that time comes they would become dependent and have to fall in line with the UN's one world government that the EU, Soros and some in the US push. I've recently wondered if that isn't the ultimate goal.
2473 2018-08-09 19:19:21 What would the performance look like in 4k when there's a lot of fire or death fog? My last PC really struggled in the oil field inferno for example (not a complaint, it was a potato)
2474 2018-08-09 19:19:11 I didn’t think so.If their oil exports will cut off the regime will collapse soon because they have no popular legitimacy in any way. At best, they have a popularity of 15%.

2479 2018-08-09 19:17:56 @LisaLaFlammeCTV you should consider including the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) on your nightly broadcast when you show oil prices. WTI, though an easy benchmark to cite, does not reflect the reality of what oil in Canada actually sells for. Thoughts?

Drink your oil & see how  they answer
2485 2018-08-09 19:17:22 Joes been wantin to try wingerz since a started speaking to him n we finally go n its all cooked in penut oil 
2486 2018-08-09 19:17:22 Blend 2 quarts ginger with 8 oz bread. Blend with Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve with love.
2487 2018-08-09 19:17:03 Sir , I see you as a father in all aspects, politics, leadership, business just to mention a few. The oil on your head will never run dry . God bless you
2488 2018-08-09 19:17:00 Nigeria's issues doesn't begin and end with PoliceNG.

There's a pervasive culture of impertinence by many in govt and all agencies to the sensibilities & rights of citizens.

They think it's oil that pays their salaries not our taxes, hence the derision.

2489 2018-08-09 19:16:59 She obviously has inferiority complex. God help her
2490 2018-08-09 19:16:59 BTW, BoNY's activities in Russia were run by Natasha Kagalovsky, wife of Konstantin Kagalovsky, then a VP of oil company Yukos & former deputy chm of Bank Menatep, both run by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who colluded with Browder in Avisma scam and is now a Browder financial supporter.
2491 2018-08-09 19:16:58 And yet compared to the other oil states, SA is making some efforts at reform.  I think that pissed them off a bit.
2492 2018-08-09 19:16:32 Yup. Away to find the coconut oil to get rid of the pandaness

I’m calling Time of Death.

This eyeliner officially deceased.

I’ll meet you at Craic’s my love. Start without me. Get the jukebox going
2493 2018-08-09 19:16:30 Tonight I think I'll make chicken, mango, peppers, onions and chow mein noodles, sauteed with pork fat, sesame oil, and soy sauce.
2494 2018-08-09 19:16:29 Even if it's only symbolics. Saudi Arabia is a rogue state in the hands of a ruthless regime. #canada remains one of it's most important arms dealer and oil customer.
2495 2018-08-09 19:16:27 Need an oil change but can’t afford the stuff rn.  Hopefully my clothing grant comes soon 
2496 2018-08-09 19:16:23 The Anointing Oil is of great value because attaining it comes at a great price. Are we willing to sell all for the Pearl of Great Price? #Jesus
2497 2018-08-09 19:16:14 I have lemon oil from our new essential oil line . . . I CRAVE fresh lemonade EVERYTIME I smell it! Is that a good thing or bad?

2500 2018-08-09 19:16:08 Аааа. Блин. Топ песня. Чёрт, теперь эта мелодия в голове играет
2501 2018-08-09 19:15:59 Reith's last night as DG of BBC - no dinner, no ceremony. Instead, he fulfilled the nightly task of shutting down one of the high-power transmitter at Droitwic's oil engines with his own hands – with his engineer's training, no one had to show him how to do it  #BBCswitchoff
2502 2018-08-09 19:15:58 And I am proposing that hypothesis is wrong. There are over 50 Black-majority countries. Some are pretty rich due to tourism or oil. That's a heck of a lot of opportunity. Not even one is remotely like Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, or even China in its economic complexity.
2503 2018-08-09 19:15:53 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2504 2018-08-09 19:15:52 There are differences but one of our fastest growing businesses supplies services to the oil industry in the UK and will doubtless look to markets abroad. We support a #PeoplesVote with a view to #Remain. The goods only Chequers White Paper doesn't cut it, but it's dead anyway.
2505 2018-08-09 19:15:20 She's just someone that has inferiority complex, she thinks she's high class above d poor's reach
2506 2018-08-09 19:15:18 My shirt smells like grease, oil, and exhaust from the bike shop, and it is one of my favorite smells 
2507 2018-08-09 19:15:10 MY OIL CHANGED ARE EIGGGGHHHTTYYYY DOLLARS IM CRYING I HAVE TO GET ONE TODAY
2508 2018-08-09 19:15:06 Forgot to change the oil in my car last night so I guess I need to do that tonight 
2509 2018-08-09 19:15:04 Oil, coal, and natural gas are not going to be the fuels of the next century.  That's the problem with this approach.
2510 2018-08-09 19:14:59 This whole taking my car to actually get an oil change not my thing. I miss having someone who was able to do it 
2511 2018-08-09 19:14:59 In oil fuelled tankers? 
2512 2018-08-09 19:14:48 Marching round the city

Widow's pot of oil

Loaves of bread and fish

Noah's ark

Abraham's ram

Moses' rod 

David's sling

Esther's character

Daniel's faith

There's a pattern with divine miracles, you gotta bring stuff to God's table
2513 2018-08-09 19:14:44 Yes me .. I've tried coconut oil so far so good 
2514 2018-08-09 19:14:42 my dog just licked my face which had TEA TREE OIL ON IT please god don’t let him die hes just recently gone deaf i can’t handle anything more
2515 2018-08-09 19:14:39 Every God-inside minded Christian is a Noah’s Ark, a temple of the Holy Spirit releasing the White Dove from their hearts. Everyday the Lord returns to His temple with a fresh olive branch of anointing oil!
2516 2018-08-09 19:14:13 y'all I'm getting my oil changed and there's an old man in the tire shop that has on a tshirt that says "deez nuts" I stg
2517 2018-08-09 19:14:02 Made some gazpacho, put like 3 green peppers in there, plus cayenne, white, and chipotle peppers. I had to add more tomato juice and olive oil bc SOME ppl were crying about the spiciness 
2518 2018-08-09 19:13:45 I feel like such an accomplished adult when I take all my little fish oil tablets, B6 pill, Vitamin C pill, and my crazy pill
2519 2018-08-09 19:13:42 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2520 2018-08-09 19:13:41 Alahai rugi je. So kene turn back kepada dr morita lah cerita die. Sobs i thought suitable. Lupe pulak pasal mineral oil. So jadi je la losyen tangan dari membazir haha 
2521 2018-08-09 19:13:32 We should have anti Arab oil rallies all across the country......let's refine our own oil!!! But sure follow the leader and be sheep
2522 2018-08-09 19:13:11 Respect Womens rights & all Human rights. no double standards. Canada has problems so does Saudi Arabia. I'm native & I'd appreciate that canada & the saudis stop supporting apartheid israels genocide of palestinians & stop supporting colonization & Oil wars.

2524 2018-08-09 19:12:57 I've never felt more manly than when holding my ground against sizzling oil and wincing, but not yelling, as it caresses my shirtless body.
2525 2018-08-09 19:12:54 The world's largest oil reserves maybe? The same thing we've been interfering in Venezuela about for at least 50 years.
2526 2018-08-09 19:12:53 California burning, Droughts in the farmlands, food rotting in the farmlands bc no one to pick it. But, But, Emails I get it, Drill for oil in the parks but waste votes on 3rd parties.... Guess Trump want off Earth, so this is his way of saying Earth is Screwed HaHaHa! Moon Base!
2527 2018-08-09 19:12:43 I’d honestly be so down for a candle or essential oil of cilantro. I can’t get enough of the smell 
2528 2018-08-09 19:12:37 That coconut oil be having me looking like a glazed donut lmao.
2529 2018-08-09 19:12:24 I used to think Saudi Arabia's main export was oil but now I'm thinking its bots.  Soo many bots.
2530 2018-08-09 19:12:15 Not sure which rags you pretend to read but Canada has not been silent on the Rohingya crisis & has sent representatives. No oil? Which cave have you been living in? That is the only resource KSA has, wielded like a club, but not forever.
2531 2018-08-09 19:12:14 Smart Value? That was a Smart Value comment? I swear no one knows less about American trade than republican Americans. Do you know that Canada supplies more Oil to the U.S. than any other country? Canada purchases more of your agricultural products than most other countries?
2532 2018-08-09 19:12:13 Like I said before, if it was up to me, USA would have no involvement with the middle east..none. but our dependency on mid east oil makes it impossible. My hope, invest in renewable energy and decrease need for mid east oil. That way the USA stops all involvement in that region.
2533 2018-08-09 19:11:57 In 1929 - The Shamrock Oil and Gas Company, today known as Diamond Shamrock, was founded in Amarillo, TX.
2534 2018-08-09 19:11:52 How come it's not worse? Banking sector is on the brink of collapse, money injection not going to slow down; Washington hasn't shown any indication of giving waivers to Iran's oil purchasers; government debt is at its all-time high; state wants to resist, worsening expectations.
2535 2018-08-09 19:11:20 Some echoes but many differences. EM much cheaper now, oil absent from equation, UST stable to rising.
2536 2018-08-09 19:11:15 I need to stack up on this body oil cause this jont smells bombbbbbb
2537 2018-08-09 19:11:13 Hey @sydneemcelroy @JustinMcElroy @Sawbones really loved the way you guys covered CBD oil in your last episode.  I mean, I love the way you cover all your topics, but just wanted to give a lil shoutout since you guys are great :) #sawbones #podcast
2538 2018-08-09 19:11:11 balsamic in my right hand. oil in my left. i wield them like twin swords criss-crossing glistening streaks into my bowl of only dried cranberries and croutons
2539 2018-08-09 19:11:10 $60 down the drain just for an oil change  it hurts my heart
2540 2018-08-09 19:11:08 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2541 2018-08-09 19:11:03 The world should say drink your oil if u can we can do without  U need water    lol
2542 2018-08-09 19:10:48 @dailyblastlive I HAVE to watch your show while I get my oil changed. I wish I could stab my ears and eyes out listening to the garbage your hosts talk about. The Oscars shouldn’t be political, that’s why the ratings are down. Get someone with half a brain to do the show.
2543 2018-08-09 19:10:43 @bulletproofexec any words of wisdom on how is best to do #bulletproofcoffee when traveling? I have no probs w coconut oil. But how to carry the butter?
2544 2018-08-09 19:10:31 The students are sponsored by their government to study abroad then go back hone and work in the oil refinery and technologies, they are not here to integrate.
2545 2018-08-09 19:10:30 “ As if you haven't read it all. If only I didn't get my oil changed!
2546 2018-08-09 19:10:23 Well, of COURSE the people who are oil rich will try to stomp out any kind of threat to their money. Solar, renewable, electric cars...all look like enemies to the Dinosaur Dictators.

2547 2018-08-09 19:10:21 エルザに殴られたなう
2548 2018-08-09 19:10:10 But we needed funding to do that and governments around the world were swayed by big oil to subsidise them and keep us on this trajectory. Even now, investment in carbon removal is tiny.
2549 2018-08-09 19:10:08 Put a lil salt in the oil before frying whatever it is that you frying
2550 2018-08-09 19:10:05 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
2551 2018-08-09 19:09:39 Hey Justin! Wanna win the next election today? Announce the Canadian Petroleum Independance Plan, build Energy East, new refinery capacity, and start counting your taxes & royalties. There is no ethical oil outside Europe & NA. How about actually 'Standing Up' for civilisation.
2552 2018-08-09 19:09:06 Some politicians deny it. But climate change is evident worldwide.
And like it or not, a century burning oil and its derivatives are the reason for this. 
2553 2018-08-09 19:09:02 This sums it up:

Saudi: We’re pulling all our citizens, money and investment out of Canada!

Canada: GOOD! Go ahead we don’t want your stinkin blood oil anyways!

Saudi: Oh except oil. You can keep buying that.

Canada: And we will!!

2554 2018-08-09 19:08:51 And like YOU said yourself, we aren't near renewable energy yet, so we NEED oil, so we NEED pipelines. Being President means doing what's best for the people in the country, even if you don't personally like it
2555 2018-08-09 19:08:42 What's a light oil
2556 2018-08-09 19:08:27 @audisouthafrica just another Audi that uses too much oil that no other dealer wants to touch. Never buy an Audi again.
2557 2018-08-09 19:08:24 My nose has 2 modes. It’s either a dry, barren wasteland where no life can be sustained , or a pit of oil so pressurized a simple touch will result in gallons rushing out thru my pores. There’s no days where it’s something between the 2. One or the other
2558 2018-08-09 19:08:17 Insanity opening up asylum to anyone anywhere in the world that has experienced violence of any type or just claims they have. 
Change your name to Global Civil Liberties Union
2559 2018-08-09 19:08:17 finally made it in time to get a damn oil change
2560 2018-08-09 19:07:58 My impression is that BLM land has long been the domain of oil companies, at least in the Belridge area.
2561 2018-08-09 19:07:54 that’s because back in the day you forgot to add the mineral oil. We all did at least once. I was there.
2562 2018-08-09 19:07:53 Firm enough to embargo Saudi oil? Firm enough to tweet the same message to China (and others)? Or just firm enough to tell Canadians that we're standing firm? This could be Trudeau's "just watch me" moment. We're watching.
2563 2018-08-09 19:07:47 lol no, i have to find a good one that doesnt have oil in it. tho i havent been looking lately
2564 2018-08-09 19:07:45 The last one with propolis is probably best , bought from Amazon.  With Neilmed or just for brushing teeth.  These purification tablets are great.  Check the food rules I always have honey and Manuka oil ( tea tree ) . In case one gets cut. I must sound like a complete geek.
2565 2018-08-09 19:07:39 No they do not.  Our allies enjoy cheap oil and many are at America’s behest financially.  The Saudi Prince is considered a bit of a joke domestically, and his father King Solomon, (who is now very ill) has had to step in when he has made huge diplomacy mistakes.
2566 2018-08-09 19:07:36 We have much better alternatives available, maybe get caught up on current technologies, that don't require oil, gas and coal, money can still be made with alternatives
2567 2018-08-09 19:07:35 Aaargh. Better when they are dropped into hot oil and come out crispy......
2568 2018-08-09 19:07:30 not depend on Saudi oil only being for sale in US dollars 
2569 2018-08-09 19:07:20 Me I use red oil

2572 2018-08-09 19:07:14 They found oil in Guyana? Uh oh 
2573 2018-08-09 19:07:13 Being president means he is for ALL Americans, including ones who want to drive SUVs. He can't ban ALL oil and pipelines because he doesn't approve, but he CAN ban the ones that are at risk of (and DID) leak, which hurts the area.
2574 2018-08-09 19:07:08 I’m about to bug out. I left my oil pastels next to my vent in a box with other meltable art materials and now it’s just a big mess .
2575 2018-08-09 19:07:06 Coconut Oil. 

Sorry. I had to.
2576 2018-08-09 19:07:05 I put a solution of egg yolk, olive oil and honey on my hair before washing it. It smells so bad but the volume SIS THE VOLUME 
2577 2018-08-09 19:07:01 The first product I bought at @Clicks_SA was a celltone tissue oil #50YearsOfValue
2578 2018-08-09 19:06:50 There's a part of this world where an army of grownups with sophisticated weaponry blew up a school bus with kids. KIDS! But hey, it's Yemen, no hashtags of 'support' - just another day in the Middle East. ICC is for blind Africans. Arms market more lucrative where there's oil.
2579 2018-08-09 19:06:41 Does anyone else wish the Repugnican mascot were a less likable "thing" than an elephant?

2580 2018-08-09 19:06:31 Are you suggesting that there may be a market for #GMOFree tires, croquet mallets, motor oil, light bulbs, mechanical pencils, etc?

2581 2018-08-09 19:06:31 Conversation with a worker at valvoline while I was getting my oil changed:                                                         Worker- “no good NFL QB ever came from the big 10

2590 2018-08-09 19:05:07 What type of oil?
2591 2018-08-09 19:04:59 B-Complex/Magnesium Pills, Peppermint Oil and cold cloths are what work for me.
2592 2018-08-09 19:04:55 What oil ?
2593 2018-08-09 19:04:52 It is close to 30 yrs when they were talking about borderless E. Africa. Where do they tend to get the oil from? There is a devil in that sort of business.
2594 2018-08-09 19:04:52 Would you please just stop sending them oil? Problem solved!
2595 2018-08-09 19:04:42 People that usually like baby oil don’t like Vaseline & vice versa.

2598 2018-08-09 19:04:14 So China says they wont abide by the sanctions, and try to import the iranian oil, yet they are also open to american exports. US wasnt happy about the former, but truth is, China needs oil imports in every quantity, and US would be glad to export their surplus.
2599 2018-08-09 19:04:13 It looks like the offer is for Conventional Oil Change only at this time, great question though! -SMT
2600 2018-08-09 19:04:09 I’m curious how many readers of “The Secret,” are now rich with money, fame or contentment, as the book once promised millions of devotees. Or is the real secret the disappointing flipside of such snake oil marketing? Hmmmmm....
2601 2018-08-09 19:04:05 I love castor oil on my skin. It is so healing. I find when I clean my lashes with it, they grow, not quite the length of the donkeys lashes

2603 2018-08-09 19:03:52 Not nagging. Starbucks' "Fair Trade" policy, along with the oil market, did much to flip the government of Ecuador away from Communist.
2604 2018-08-09 19:03:45 @SenSchumer Sen Sch the USA has more nat gas then a trillion elephants could fart in a billion years. FUCK Coal and crude oil. SOLAR, Wind and nat gas to the rescue.

2607 2018-08-09 19:03:12 The canned kinds are accessible year round in the US.  I don't know what they grow in France.  I know the pumpkins they grow in Austria (Styria) are  mostly used for salad oil.

If you get your car serviced for a simple oil change and filter and it takes longer than 20 minutes, go somewhere else. Also if they quote you a price don't let them change it.
2611 2018-08-09 19:02:48 This "Non-GMO" mantra is a clearly misleading, often false and always meaningless trope of the modern-day multi-billion-dollar snake oil industry.  It's measurably the biggest (# of people) and costliest ($'s spent) mass consumer fraud perpetuated in modern history.

2622 2018-08-09 19:01:34 I bought a oil change on Groupon for cheep 
2623 2018-08-09 19:01:34 I'll get the oil 
2624 2018-08-09 19:01:26 Afternoon all.
Went to BrakesPlus in north Phoenix on Tatum Blvd today for a simple oil change and filter which resulted in a total failure. They gave me a quote then changed the price and wanted one hour for an oil change and I had an appointment, don't go there.
2625 2018-08-09 19:01:22 Saudi's human rights have been questioned for at least the last 40 years but I suppose oil is more important than human lives.  In he same breath, Saudi would be within its rights to question US human rights.
2626 2018-08-09 19:01:16 see this one o.. sth I stil did today. . I even added onion & small groundnut oil. 

U ad beta de-worm yasef.
2627 2018-08-09 19:01:15 After the 06 WC, my (now ex) wife and I went to Switzerland and while there tried a meat fondue where they give you a bunch of different raw meats, some skewers and a little pot of hot oil to cook them. 

(CTD...)
2628 2018-08-09 19:01:01 They probably found something that may resemble oil or water. Gotta get their hands on it before anyone else.
2629 2018-08-09 19:00:57 Oil, gold, and slaves.
2630 2018-08-09 19:00:49 Grab hold of your self-awareness, walk in the spirit within & wash your hair and scalp daily & more w/NEEM oil w/DSMO, and Apple Cider Vinegar w/mothers. Leave them on hr or 2. Do same in shower to get the Nano & Neural Smart Dust crap off. Hope u find relief.
2631 2018-08-09 19:00:49 Jesus H Christ in a side car... what planet did we discover oil on and what kind of aliens do we have to war with to warrant a Space Force?
2632 2018-08-09 19:00:48 "The Trump administration has taken a step toward opening 1.6 million acres of public land in California to fracking and oil drilling"
2633 2018-08-09 19:00:44 Nothing better then spending my only day off at Firestone waiting 3 hours to get my vehicle inspection and oil change. #LivingMyBestLife
2634 2018-08-09 19:00:36 Denise there have been several RCT and Meta-analysis published now that find NO EVIDENCE that SATURATED FATS are harmful. In fact studies have proven Full Fat Diary to be "protective" against CVD - which includes Butter and Cheese. Also Coconut Oil & EVOO actually raises HDL-C!

2638 2018-08-09 19:00:23 Hey @missminifer, absolutely loving Green Roasting Tin but just wondering if the numbers are wrong for the tahini n lemon sauce (the one with the roasted cauli)?  seems like too much oil/ water to me?
2639 2018-08-09 19:00:22 So all this B's and we still get Saudi oil wtf???
2640 2018-08-09 19:00:18 Dani, I never tasted or had truffle oil myself! I take it you won't be ever having truffle oil any more for sure! 
2641 2018-08-09 19:00:09 아이고 아이고 은하나 좀 달래주세요 은하도 아파라 얍
2642 2018-08-09 19:00:01 The 1978 arab/european deal over oil. That's what dunnit
2643 2018-08-09 18:59:55 Telling someone to chill out is like tossing oil in a fire. You just don’t do it
2644 2018-08-09 18:59:47 Oil settles lower for a second session in a row, a day after Wednesday's steep plunge
2645 2018-08-09 18:59:27 my teacher is the owner of an oil refinery, would yall be mad if i doxx him lol just asking
2646 2018-08-09 18:59:24 WHERES MY FUCKING COCONUT OIL?!?!
2647 2018-08-09 18:59:20 I have an hour & a half to get ready, pack, get an oil change and to vaccum my car.... race against time it is
2648 2018-08-09 18:59:18 @Tikkurila_UK walls and ceilings and oil based on woodwork
2649 2018-08-09 18:59:17 아이고 생리통이요 아이고 배도 허리도 아파요 아이고
2650 2018-08-09 18:59:11 Lol. The “holistic” approach. Like the dad from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and his windex. The natural healers just put coconut oil on everything 
2651 2018-08-09 18:59:07 I bought a leave-in conditioner with coconut oil and pureed banana in it... so if you're at #QuakeCon and you smell what seems to be a spilt cocktail at Trader Vic's?

Well, you found me.
2652 2018-08-09 18:59:05 Ya'll I made a dressing for my salad out of ACV, Coconut Oil, Salt, Pepper and Parsley ... thank me later.
2653 2018-08-09 18:59:01 Canada. In the Ontario's election, electors have massively voted against Liberals. A vote against Trudeau? How badly is Trudeau managing the oil of Western Canada ? Qu'est ce que Trudeau a fait pour protéger les entreprises du Québec et pour promouvoir l'économie? Time 4 renewal?
2654 2018-08-09 18:59:01 I'm more of a clothes on (I HATE oil) and a rub and buff (gentle/relaxing) type when I get mine. (Though at times I will put up with lotion if I need some deeper work.)  It's all about finding the technique/masseuse that works for you.
2655 2018-08-09 18:58:42 no oil money for poor Guyanese!let dem take it with violence.
2656 2018-08-09 18:58:29 Alaskans own 163,706 shares of PETROFAC LTD, worth $1,881,250. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in UNITED KINGDOM.
2657 2018-08-09 18:58:23 Clearly there's *something* potent in all that snake oil.
2658 2018-08-09 18:58:22 Unfortunately not. I’ve been begging and pleading. Bought her a copy of your book and a bottle of MCT oil. No go. “Too confusing” and “my dr says this is just what happens w/ageing.” Sigh.
2659 2018-08-09 18:58:04 Dad: “You putting HoNeY in your hair?”

Mom: ... oil
2660 2018-08-09 18:57:44 One of the places I will never go on my own free will is Saudi Arabia. Their barbaric rules and laws, practically have slaves, Ill treatment of women. Oil washes away these sins
2661 2018-08-09 18:57:43 top tier - lard or beef fat
nord tier/french tier - butter
med tier - olive oil
burger tier - hydrogenated corn oil
2662 2018-08-09 18:57:39 Hang on a minute. When the Saudis and Emirates pay you and your family $3.6 billion to put on sanctions (good for their oil biz), you start sanctioning. And yes Mueller knows. Put on some popcorn. Crank up the Neil Young! 
2663 2018-08-09 18:57:31 Switch off the phone. Disconnect. Use eucalyptus oil instead of bug spray. 
2664 2018-08-09 18:57:23 Spark plugs and oil change? 
2665 2018-08-09 18:57:17 All those attacks that are made against @drbirute are not justified. 
It sounds to me that people are trying to discredit her amazing works by pure greed.
Is the land of Camp Leakey on a waiting list for a future palm oil plantation? 
I see no other explanation.
2666 2018-08-09 18:57:14 Been burning midnight oil for the past idk how many nights
2667 2018-08-09 18:57:13 The only time I hope my oil change takes forever so I can watch the entire finale of #TheSecretLifeofJeffreeStar @shanedawson has literally killed it. Seeing this side of @JeffreeStar has been more than amazing 
2668 2018-08-09 18:57:04 They had cut me down now I am off the all using the oil. Big Pharma can have them all I feel so much better and no more massive chronic pain. I believe the pain pills actually made it worse now. Wishing everyone the best. I know it’s a struggle. If I can help I am always here.
2669 2018-08-09 18:56:53 Extra virgin olive oil
2670 2018-08-09 18:56:51 Wrong. Only a fraction of the oil was purchased  and whisky receipts were appropriated via head offices being moved. I’m trying to listen to the Gers so maybe try yer nonsense on someone else......
2671 2018-08-09 18:56:44 No. These are not oil wells in Kuwait. Additionally some species rely on forest fires for the survival of their seeds.
2672 2018-08-09 18:56:32 아파서 잠이 안 와ㅠㅠㅠ
2673 2018-08-09 18:56:30 Keep kidding yourself. They drink big oil for breakfast. Big oil and munitions.
2674 2018-08-09 18:56:14 I just need those shorts 
@letta_tsakie  You can have the coconut oil lol
2675 2018-08-09 18:56:08 $7000 plus $3000 doc fee and a free oil change that I just so happened to do before I wanted to sell it.
2676 2018-08-09 18:56:06 허리도 배도 아프면 어케 살아
2677 2018-08-09 18:56:05 being a bottom who can drive means that i am, at times, uncomfortable in my own community. people ask me questions like, "how's your car, top?" and "how do you change your oil?" almost every day. i can only imagine a future where
2678 2018-08-09 18:55:57 Nah, everything they do is to make themselves richer NOW. They don’t care if their children will be able to breath the air or drink the water they are reversing pollution laws on while the oil/chem companies line their pockets. Space force is ALL about Donny’s ego that’s it
2679 2018-08-09 18:55:54 They shouldn't be dripping oil, u did them wrong
2680 2018-08-09 18:55:52 $DRIP 6.56 long new  i have no idea whats going on. Just following the math. apparently oil services are bearish. It may be that the energy longs are all nat gas related. Im sure it will all make sense at some point.
2681 2018-08-09 18:55:51 I need a really good moisturizer for my natural hair. Preferably cream or oil based. Any suggestions? No Cantu products please.
2682 2018-08-09 18:55:36 아파 너무 아파 으는ㄷ그그
2683 2018-08-09 18:55:28 Venezuela wasn’t ruined by socialism. It was ruined by corruption. Being dependent on oil and pegging their currency to the USA dollar.

Hope that helps 
2684 2018-08-09 18:55:05 Tomi and polite, Tomi and polite......... What the hell are you talking about?? Its like mixing oil drilled from iraq and mixing it with water from florida. They dont mix!!!!
2685 2018-08-09 18:55:05 You can bet Trump won't comment on this. He loves Saudi money and oil more than humans.
2686 2018-08-09 18:55:03 America's Oil Production Boom Is a Bubble Waiting to Pop
The shale oil companies pumping ever more oil and losing ever more money. Even with the recent increases in the oil price US fracking operations are just not profitable

Dmitry Orlov
2687 2018-08-09 18:55:00 Venezuela is in a different situation to the UK 
It has a large foreign denominated debt and a currency peg. It has political instability, high levels of corruption, and an economy reliant on an oil industry and hydroelectricity and is susceptible to supply side shocks.
2688 2018-08-09 18:55:00 I have a google scholar alert for sour cherries and just got a notification that somebody filed a patent on a sour cherry seed extract and seed oil manufacturing process to make a "biotherapeutic anti-inflammatory composition."
So, uh, coming soon to sephora I guess?
2689 2018-08-09 18:54:46 They purchased our oil. There is no duty on whisky. The IFS and others have shown that we generated lots of taxes in Scotland on oil and we have spent every penny of it here. Future tax revenues will offset our deficit but are never expected to wipe it out.
2690 2018-08-09 18:54:44 ¿Oil? ¿Watercolor? ¿Pastel? ¿Mix?

2693 2018-08-09 18:54:31 [Hook me up] with some of that [oil man], i gonna go get [leaned on] that syrup
2694 2018-08-09 18:54:26 On TV yesterday: Saudi Arabia has a plan to keep their economy growing after the oil runs out. I'm guessing it's connected to the fact Saudi Arabia has a huge source of cheap Kitty Litter.
2695 2018-08-09 18:54:22 Secondly 73m3 ‘reinjected ’ really? That’s naughty, you’re making it sound like it was fractured....when we clearly know it wasn’t, you know better than that.....oil exploration shouldn’t be stopped just because you disagree with it....you’ll need to find a more plausible one
2696 2018-08-09 18:54:14 I oily type. Sejauh i baca mmg mineral oil ada possibilities untuk clog pores sbb particle size besar & tak serap masuk kulit hence those whiteheads, blackheads & bumps. Try stop jap guna rosken for a few days and observe your skin. Kena try & error je macam ni 
2697 2018-08-09 18:54:07 Leave these tools in the dust! It’s time for Canada to ramp up the oil sands!
2698 2018-08-09 18:53:53 I use Salon Quality (I get it grocery shops) with a few drops of eucalyptus oil. I also use eucalyptus oil + Shea butter to moisturize and it’s reduced my occurrence of dandruff significantly. Or the Head & Shoulders menthol one, amazing!
2699 2018-08-09 18:53:52 No one knows for sure yet. US will cover some, but the issue is grades of oil by quality makes it less clear. Some from Russian onshore fields in the Arctic, but still unclear, particularly since China is not putting tariffs on US oil.
2700 2018-08-09 18:53:51 May I suggest at the very least, a drizzle of olive oil?
2701 2018-08-09 18:53:49 I barely see him and he lives like 2 hours away and works 2 weeks out of the month on an oil rig. With softball and school I barely see him, waiting months at a time. :( I’m not complaining cause some people don’t have a mother or father but I still miss him okay :(
2702 2018-08-09 18:53:49 She stood up for an Afgan who was being deported for being a criminal. But she didnt know that or bother to find out. Neither did you.
2703 2018-08-09 18:53:47 Oh man. I needed that 10 hours of sleep just now. Burnt a lot of midnight oil this last week finishing up Dino Mega Charge.
2704 2018-08-09 18:53:26 LTE guidance on wildfires and climate  Zinke is a BAD representative for DOI,  a liar who wants $ for oil/gas at any cost to environment and animals.  He needs to LEAVE. Hope they get him  for his  crimes real soon. Bad like Pruitt,  at least  Pruitt was forced out.
2705 2018-08-09 18:53:08 #herbchat Some honey sold in stores has zero honey inside. Corn syrup and oil.
2706 2018-08-09 18:52:46 I’m bout to get an oil change where u babes
2707 2018-08-09 18:52:41 Actually, Newfoundland and Labrador exports more oil than we import from Saudi Arabia. But we'd pay more for it than the Saudi because of its high quality...

2709 2018-08-09 18:52:19 Anyone need some sun tan oil?
2710 2018-08-09 18:52:09 Yet your millionaire pres candidate owned stock in big oil while demanding others divest.

By every scientific measure, GOP is INFINITELY more harmful to the environment than Dems. By pretending otherwise, you are science deniers. 

As a former Green activist, I'm ashamed of you.
2711 2018-08-09 18:52:06 All I can think is “that poor girl in the stock photo is now forever associated with being a dick guillotine”

2715 2018-08-09 18:51:19 I’m not familiar with the facts, but if it involves endangerment of species, similar to Borneo / palm oil / Orangutans, then I think we can say it’s wrong, regardless of where we are. One planet !
2716 2018-08-09 18:51:05 Flowers should be everywhere, especially in uncertainty. Massage gardenia oil into your boredom.
2717 2018-08-09 18:50:53 You’re painting your own house. What make and type of paint do you use for -

Walls and ceilings
Woodwork - oil based
Woodwork - water based

Just interested to hear what you’d use and not what a customer wanted.
2718 2018-08-09 18:50:42 Great question! The liquids restriction applies here, which means that the oil has to be 100 ml or less and part of your 1 L bag.
2719 2018-08-09 18:50:40 Wo to mast oil mai fry kar k kha gya wo 
2720 2018-08-09 18:50:34 Sounds like you could be 'transgender'! 
2721 2018-08-09 18:50:33 stripped and sanded. Walnut husk dye to deepen the wood because it's birch.  Several light coats of fiddes hard wax oil, de-nibbing between coats then a final buff before fully cured to even the top coat.
2722 2018-08-09 18:50:24 Regardless of what backs the US dollar wouldn’t we want oil prices in dollars? Countries have to buy dollars to buy oil...
2723 2018-08-09 18:50:23 I think it was held up artificially high cos of oil exports and influence of financial services in 1980s to 2000s

Obviously it would be better to manage without competitive devaluations, but truth is our manufacturing was priced out.
2724 2018-08-09 18:50:11 Who's this big nigga in oil on the TL?
2725 2018-08-09 18:50:00 Of course it won't. That's their bread & butter. Time we use our own oil. Stop letting 1% of the country punish the 99% of our country.
2726 2018-08-09 18:50:00 Yeah. For real. They switched to sunflower oil and I can’t eat them now. I’m literally so sad.
2727 2018-08-09 18:49:50 There is comfort in knowing that it's not all in my head - thanks. Yes, they can treat it with corticosteroids or #CBD oil. I chose the oil. #cannabis @emblemcannabis
2728 2018-08-09 18:49:45 My bestfriend and I went to get her oil changed in that area and I didn’t get out the car. Lmao whole process I was in there doors locked. 
2729 2018-08-09 18:49:15 real talk: cbd oil kicks ass
2730 2018-08-09 18:49:12 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
2731 2018-08-09 18:49:02 Oil change time 
2732 2018-08-09 18:48:59 I used olive oil on my children when they had it. Phones playing up thus the nonsense message. Sorry
2733 2018-08-09 18:48:57 peppermint oil works wonders for migraines
2734 2018-08-09 18:48:38 My cars low oil pressure light came on. So I added oil to it and it turned off. 
I’m now a mechanic
2735 2018-08-09 18:48:30 Remember back during the Iraq war they’d bomb burning oil wells and it would put the flame out...
2736 2018-08-09 18:48:27 It's probably true.  Oil & Gas companies are all over the state fracking and polluting, raping the natural resources
2737 2018-08-09 18:48:21 sardine oil
2738 2018-08-09 18:48:06 See if I can finesse this oil change
2739 2018-08-09 18:47:56 I believe I should control my uterus. It's the men who need to burn the midnight oil.
2740 2018-08-09 18:47:55 As set piece movie shoot outs go, it’s pretty hard to beat the Guggenheim scene in The International. Wind River comes very close with the confrontation with the oil workers but nothing else I can think of.
2741 2018-08-09 18:47:42 I want some feed ins but but every since I been using wild growth oil on my edges l don’t think they’ll lay down they do thick
2742 2018-08-09 18:47:32 I meant deeply as far as past your first layer of skin and hair. It’s a penetrating oil lol
2743 2018-08-09 18:47:31 Yeah that’s what my mom wants is a CBD oil but there is just soooo many out there.
2744 2018-08-09 18:47:28 She was an actual girl in our road as kids and we used to annoy her by calling her Linseed Oil - she used to go home crying; I blamed the parents.
2745 2018-08-09 18:47:28 Oil.
2746 2018-08-09 18:47:26 I took my son to a massage therapist today, and she taught me how to massage his head. She also gave me a specially-made oil blend for children with concussions -- all for no charge! What a kind-hearted lady 
2747 2018-08-09 18:47:11 I'm preventing people to drink snake oil.
2748 2018-08-09 18:47:06 Hey @innoutburger thank you for switching to sun flower oil to which I am allergic and can longer enjoy your amazing fries. #mydayisruined
2749 2018-08-09 18:46:55 The oil is amazing. Smells good too
2750 2018-08-09 18:46:51 Got an oil change, and they’re like yeah you needed a change like 3000 miles ago... 
2751 2018-08-09 18:46:44 Please don't use a K&N air filter in your car. They use an oil film coating (which you wash and then reoil) which is pulled over your MAF sensor. Which makes that sensor read wrong, causing your car to run rough. It will also coat and clog your throttle body.
2752 2018-08-09 18:46:43 essential oils! lavender oil + warm compress on your tummy should help
2753 2018-08-09 18:46:42 love Murphy's Oil. Brightens it all up!
2754 2018-08-09 18:46:34 Peppermint oil on the back of your neck and on your wrists will help.
2755 2018-08-09 18:46:27 Right now I just use a regular leave in conditioner oil and cream from this brand called hydro quench system, they are on IG. And have a website. I need yo find a stylist down here where I moved but I'm so scared lol.
2756 2018-08-09 18:46:25 He should be on a plane back to Eritrea instead of a sanctuary city in Ohio.
2757 2018-08-09 18:46:21 @realDonaldTrump Hi PRESIDENT TRUMP. How Maduro and his government is surviving? Is it that they are selling oil to Russia, China and Cuba?

2762 2018-08-09 18:45:47 I've been saying that for years. But the bitumen must be refined in Alberta, otherwise it's unsafe to transport. Most of our oil reserves are in the hands of foreign companies. They don't care about Canada, only money. (But that's their job).  #cdnpoli
2763 2018-08-09 18:45:44 Dear Elon....would you prefer to send me a check for the losses sustained on my short position in Tesla TSLA or rather it come from the massive forthcoming litigation?  Your choice.  @elonmusk @CNBCnow @CNBCClosingBell @carlquintanilla
2764 2018-08-09 18:45:42 I mean, beard wash is $20. But my dad makes his own beard oil.
2765 2018-08-09 18:45:40 Coconut oil is a light moisturizer. It doesn’t moisturize your skin deeply at all lol may have you glistening for a while but not moisturize too much
2766 2018-08-09 18:45:39 I'm from McMurray and my hubby and brother still work there. I get it. The pipeline is crucial and it's a shame the east can't support us but would rather buy oil from countries who have a record of human rights abuses.
2767 2018-08-09 18:45:30 Ted Yoho stands behind Trump on Tariff's that is Killing Florida's Trade& Hurting Business's across Florida!He stands behind Trump's EPA on allowing Pesticides that kill children&pollutes our air!Tearing up our protected lands like Florida ever glades!Off shore Waters for oil!
2768 2018-08-09 18:45:05 From our dm: "Hello Good evening.
Please I have an interview with an oil servicing/ engineering firm .
I wouldn’t know if anyone has an idea of the pay for an entry level  employee"
2769 2018-08-09 18:44:58 The only thing Saudi Arabia can do in retaliation.  Is cut oil production or have another group from Afghanistan destroy another major sky scraper in the USA.
2770 2018-08-09 18:44:53 C'est ce que je me demande aussi. La tee tree oil c'est cool mais pour me retrouver avec une septicémie .... moins cool. distillation versus dilution de gnôle ????
2771 2018-08-09 18:44:51 @HouseGOP  Can we get the GOP to point out that America could have had an economic recovery 9 years ago if Democrats could have given up some of the tax money to give a corporate tax break to businesses and/or allowed drilling for oil. Why would Americans vote Dem again? Fight!
2772 2018-08-09 18:44:50 You need to apply vegetable oil to your GPU, runs like butter
2773 2018-08-09 18:44:45 Hahah try wd40 or cooking oil if you don’t have anything else to loosen it
2774 2018-08-09 18:44:22 Why don't we have the oil Bush stole?
2775 2018-08-09 18:44:10 We certainly can't: If we have to turn our eyes away as these savage leaders detain, torture and kill citizens who ask for nothing more than to be treated as part of the human race, then I say keep your oil, take your patients, your students and your investments. Good Riddance!
2776 2018-08-09 18:44:03 @SenateGOP  Can we get the GOP to point out that America could have had an economic recovery 9 years ago if Democrats could have given up some of the tax money to give a corporate tax break to businesses and/or allowed drilling for oil. Why would Americans vote Dem again? Fight!
2777 2018-08-09 18:44:01 No they are not proposing it. they are voting it. Except when the money goes for WAR/OIL/BANKs you don't ask any questions, because you are an idiot, an asshole or both. Medicare for all costs 32T, which is FAR LESS than the current system, you moron.
2778 2018-08-09 18:43:57 SA survives only by oil. Just to make u feel better, Canada has oil. We also have a ton of other resources. We could be self-reliant if we really had to be. But, we r a strong country & we have many things to offer in the world & SA is a sliver of that. Try not to worry.
2779 2018-08-09 18:43:52 Democrats and Republicans have both destroyed our planet. 

While Scott Wagner calls voters "young and niave" for wanting to solve the climate crisis, Tom Wolf accepts thousands of dollars from big oil, and will not take action on fracking or pipelines.

We oppose both. Proudly.
2780 2018-08-09 18:43:44 When I compare Saudi Arabia & UAE with my dear Nigeria, I can't stop wondering if our own oil s groundnut oil!
2781 2018-08-09 18:43:36 I would love to PM you or anyone reading this that uses CBD oil.  I’m interested!
2782 2018-08-09 18:43:30 @GOP  Can we get the GOP to point out that America could have had an economic recovery 9 years ago if Democrats could have given up some of the tax money to give a corporate tax break to businesses and/or allowed drilling for oil.

2783 2018-08-09 18:43:29 It’s been so hot for so long that my tube of petroleum jelly has the consistency of mineral oil 
2784 2018-08-09 18:43:21 So rich, white people can escape the mess they made here while overseeing the labor we peons will have to do to extract all the oil and minerals from this planet to support tbose wacky folks. By 2020. Sure. Part of me is crying,  part is laughing.
2785 2018-08-09 18:43:10 She must be a sick fellow sorry to say
2786 2018-08-09 18:43:09 they're infused coconut oil with a bit of lecithin. Molding them like this gives me a decent idea of how much I'm using.
2787 2018-08-09 18:43:08 This coconut oil has my skin feeling like butter, ngl .

2789 2018-08-09 18:42:53 I can't remember having tinned tuna before we joined EEC/EU ... it was salmon in oil (horrible).
2790 2018-08-09 18:42:50 Between Newfoundland and Alberta, there's more than enough oil to satisfy the needs of Canada. In fact, this spat likely helps those provinces.

2797 2018-08-09 18:42:32 Got it. Awaiting the images.

You only need half a neuron to know that his acolytes in media team have been burning midnight oil trying to make the forgeries airtight 
2798 2018-08-09 18:42:30 Replying to @AstroKatie and @Dsmithsquamish
We are more susceptible to facts, if someone with some common traits, tries to convince us.  So like oil on water.
2799 2018-08-09 18:42:28 Yes ma’am... Bulletproof Coffee (coffee, heavy whipping cream, MCT oil, butter and SF syrup) is used when doing Keto. It helps get your fats in and keep you full.
2800 2018-08-09 18:42:21 60 quid for a liter of palm oil? LOL
2801 2018-08-09 18:42:18 I don’t even give a shit about selling our oil to China when we can’t even sell it to Quebec and Ontario.
2802 2018-08-09 18:42:17 I pictured you leaving with a couple of oil drums of it from Waverley or Haymarket train station.
2803 2018-08-09 18:42:13 Biotin and fish oi vitamins. massage your scalp daily. Put coconut oil in your hair especially the roots, and leave it in for as long as you can then wash your hair really good to make sure it’s not oily.  No heat. Put conditioner on your scalp and leave it in while you wash
2804 2018-08-09 18:42:10 Aduh tiap kali kau tweet pasal o&g ni mesti aku baca as oil and gas haha.

2806 2018-08-09 18:41:56 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
2807 2018-08-09 18:41:56 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2808 2018-08-09 18:41:54 yes but in Alberta oil pumps are legal citizens and we need room for them too
2809 2018-08-09 18:41:45 Yes apparently so,  they tell you to put oil in your ears for 2 weeks which should loosen the wax and your body then breaks the wax up naturally.

2811 2018-08-09 18:41:24 Anyone else have an insanely hard time sleeping last night? Both my manager & I were late to work this morning bc we were up until about 2am (in different places obviously) with REALLY bad anxiety. I practically bathed in lavender oil & it barely helped at all.
2812 2018-08-09 18:41:18 This vicious attack on democratic country that has given refuge to people who are escaping tranny by  laughable oil Sheiks who major quest in the world is  about yatches and  villas in Europe. Saudis who defending these  clowns should be ashamed of themselves
2813 2018-08-09 18:41:16 Yes. But the sanctions weren't about securing Europe's market, so that misrepresents what happened. Market factors will dominate oil and gas relations going forward. Russian firms are seeking assets abroad for that very reason. But more US oil and LNG will go to Europe, sure.
2814 2018-08-09 18:41:15 Such an awesome sale for my clients to scoop up their favorites! No.2 facial oil here I come!! #betterbeauty #switchtosafer
2815 2018-08-09 18:41:13 Shit i get a set of day and night multivitamins. I got cal mag d, fish oil but the multis got both those in them too i forgot about that
2816 2018-08-09 18:41:07 We sell it weapons because the Harper government signed a deal with SA years ago. Irving Oil buys from SA, ostensibly because it's profitable. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to blame this whole thing on Justin Trudeau 
2817 2018-08-09 18:41:00 I declare your set time for divine perfection of superabundance! There is fresh oil flowing from heaven to you NOW in the name of Jesus!!!
2818 2018-08-09 18:40:54 Today Steve’s getting an oil change and a nice thorough wash, treating my baby on this fine morning
2819 2018-08-09 18:40:50 Il Duce did too. Also sold off nation's oil rights, & eliminated (murdered) the man who could prove his & his 3/4 fascist government's election was fraudulent .
2820 2018-08-09 18:40:44 U want to know what is funny? While SA is pulling out students, SA patients in hospitals, cancelling flights, selling off Canadian equity, stopping trade there is one thing they won’t touch. They have stated that they will continue to sell oil to Canada. Why? B/c they need us.
2821 2018-08-09 18:40:41 Nora, shame, sexualizing cars plays into Big Oil strategy ;-)
2822 2018-08-09 18:40:39 Are these made of oil/wax or snacks or what? So interesting

2825 2018-08-09 18:40:01 Can we have it both ways ? Defend human rights but continue to buy the oil. Dismiss our Ambassador, dump  stocks, recall students but sell us oil. 
2826 2018-08-09 18:40:01 Why does Saudi get to dictate that selling us Oil is their decision?
2827 2018-08-09 18:40:00 Wow! Unemployment is down b/c "everyone is working 2 jobs", people on Medicare don't ever die, and they sure don't run up additional medical bills before they do. Boston University must be burning the midnight oil trying to figure out how to distance themselves from this dullard.

Bounce tomorrow? Let's see
2830 2018-08-09 18:39:47 Thank you.  I wasn’t asking about remote start though.   Will features like under vehicle status such as tire pressure and oil life be available?  Also, will the vehicle location feature be available?
2831 2018-08-09 18:39:47 @AnjuliCBC Thank you for covering the story on the oil spill. However, when I looked into trying to find contact info for MFR Oil Response I can't seem to find anything. Not even a website for them. Do they have something online to apply for the jobs they are looking to fill?
2832 2018-08-09 18:39:33 U.S. CRUDE OIL FUTURES SETTLE AT $66.81/BBL, DOWN 13 CENTS, 0.19 PCT
2833 2018-08-09 18:39:29 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil 
2834 2018-08-09 18:39:26 Saudi Arabia attacked the U.S. not Iran. Iran pushed for denuclearization in the Middle East not Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is committing genocide in Yemen not Iran. The truth is Saudi’s sell oil to America Iran doesn’t, that’s the real reason you’re told to hate them.
2835 2018-08-09 18:39:21 Lmfaooo I’ve been trying not to bother it and just put tea tree oil on it.
2836 2018-08-09 18:39:06 And STILL we have pipeline protestors who would rather buy oil from those shithole countries.  We need to cut off ALL ties to that region.
2837 2018-08-09 18:38:38 The oil field is one huge hurry up & wait game
2838 2018-08-09 18:38:33 Hey where’s the olive oil at?
2839 2018-08-09 18:38:28 But of course an anti Trump message, the guy is a lying snake oil salesman, he can't even answer Mueller's questions because he can't stick to one story

2843 2018-08-09 18:37:56 Yesssss so much. The Moroccan oil brand hydrating hair mask saves my hair, my curls will start to go fuzzy and flat and i do that mask and my hair gets ringletty again, i do it like once or twice a week :))
2844 2018-08-09 18:37:52 You are correct.  It works on oil well fires only because the blast can be contained and snuff out oxygen
2845 2018-08-09 18:37:44 Will u be campaigning to make the North East an independent country and thus the priority? You might want to ask UK Gov, which controls oil taxation policies and revenue, why Aberdeen has always looked like a poor oil capital compared with many other oil capitals around the world
2846 2018-08-09 18:37:36 Nah the way you spend time defending the silliest things is reminiscent of pyramid scheme folks tryna sell snake oil to you so they can get back the money they dumped in there. You don't believe most of the things you're saying but you gotta get paid
2847 2018-08-09 18:37:35 Tea tree oil e aloé vera
2848 2018-08-09 18:37:28 I made some essential oil bug spray, a roll on insect repellent and a bed bunk & shoe spray for my daughter to bring to camp. Plus I’ve added tea tree and lavender to her leave-in detangler shampoo & conditioner for lice killer lol
2849 2018-08-09 18:37:27 Yes, but beside that, would you agree that whether intentional or not, the sanctions will create a niche in european gas and oil market, that could be filled by other country like US or UAE/SA with tanker exports? 1/2

2853 2018-08-09 18:36:52 Kanye is in the Illuminati! So is Jay-Z! Beyonce isn’t though! Sandy Hook was a test; everyone was a paid actor! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2854 2018-08-09 18:36:43 California is at war with your boy, Trump. We're going drive fossil fuels out of the state. All zero-emission vehicles are welcome here. You see FCEVs as the real threat to Big Oil. Why else spam twitter with multiple accounts?
2855 2018-08-09 18:36:38 I like the rumble of the diesel and the smell of the oil

I percolate my coffee off the radiator boil

I been chasin' tuna nearly 27 years

I got the eyeballs of an eagle but there's ringin' in my ears
2856 2018-08-09 18:36:35 I’ve noticed that when i say “no butter or oil” my order comes with more oil and butter than usual... could be being trolled
2857 2018-08-09 18:36:34 I guess controlling Yemen would allow exporting Oil directly throught it, without going throught Oman Golf controlled by Iran
US have lost in Syria, they will win in Yemen
citizen will once again pay the price
French, English, Americain, Europeen... we should all feel responsible
2858 2018-08-09 18:36:16 I use GNC vitamin E, that was a gift from a friend. I use Coconut oil from Trader Joe's

2861 2018-08-09 18:36:03 Oil basically flat from yesterday's nasty close. Signals more downside. Still holding $SCO from oil $70s.
2862 2018-08-09 18:36:01 They want the cash from the sale of oil to Canada. Period
2863 2018-08-09 18:35:49 Yeah we're all either hicks, cowboys or oil workers according to people that live in Ontario.
2864 2018-08-09 18:35:45 I didn’t mind Drew and found him fairly interesting in explaining some of the technical issues behind goals and defensive breakdowns. I think perhaps he was not as much a “homer” as Oil fans would have wanted like radio legends like Rod Phillips or John Short. Each to their own.
2865 2018-08-09 18:35:33 didn't I just read that the Kingdom will keep selling oil to Canada? the Prince's daddy must have stepped in again...
2866 2018-08-09 18:35:31 Yeah, that's not a government organization and hot tip?....gas companies get federal funding doesn't make you entitled to call yourself an oil baron. Try again.

2868 2018-08-09 18:35:23 I have been very adult-y recently. I got new tires and oil for my car, got eye and dentist appointments scheduled, and went to get my license and car tags renewed

Am I done? Did I win adulthood? Can I stop now?

2870 2018-08-09 18:35:14 You think Justin Trudeau is a tool of big oil? What evidence do you have of this? Don’t get me wrong he’s just another slime ball politician but Oil companies hate Trudeau.
2871 2018-08-09 18:34:59 I can read it, it's just not as immediate as reading normal handwriting. I also had no idea what Murphy Oil was so that was a headscratcher.

2874 2018-08-09 18:34:38 It’s sad that so many poor Scots are being conned by the Nats. Being told they’ll all be rich and it’s ‘oor’ oil and all you have to do is destroy one of the most successful countries in human history.
2875 2018-08-09 18:34:36 Aku rasa aku mcm dah jatuh cinta dengan tea tree oil tu

2879 2018-08-09 18:34:28 Severino Serrano couldn't be a bottle of oil, but he doesn't like it.
2880 2018-08-09 18:34:21 Do you think changing your oil is important? Kevin will be doing a live video this afternoon showing how to check if you need to change the oil in your car! Be sure to tune in!
2881 2018-08-09 18:34:18 The Prize by Yergin. Not technical per se, but highly fascinating account of the development of the oil industry.
2882 2018-08-09 18:34:09 He is in a quandary If he blocks Saudi oil he  has to allow Alberta oil and admit it is in the national interest to do so. If he allows Saudi oil then his SJW scolding tweets  are justmore  hot air trying to gain votes, while at the  same time ignoring Iran's violations

2890 2018-08-09 18:33:20 Justin endorsed and supported the new pipeline out west that will hopefully reduce our dependency on eastern oil. Rome wasn't built in a day. Patience young padawan.

2893 2018-08-09 18:33:08 Pretty sure they want to minimize us bringing $20 oil from Alberta into our eastern provinces/states.
2894 2018-08-09 18:32:58 Wow. So that makes my NPR name Floral Mercury (which sounds more like a snake oil "cure" than an NPR personality ). Pretty sure I like my porn name better. :-)
2895 2018-08-09 18:32:40 Of course. They can demonize Canada but please buy our oil
2896 2018-08-09 18:32:39 For oil purchase from itself !!
What a game !
2897 2018-08-09 18:32:15 Another vacay with the essential oil king; this time they spilled in his bag. We are drowning in minty lavender night scents  @BreezySzn
2898 2018-08-09 18:32:07 With national oil production at record levels is it necessary to tap into the "National Petroleum Reserve"? The R in NPR-A does still stand for "Reserve", right, or is there another R word in there now?

2908 2018-08-09 18:31:14 Most here too. Only my fancy oil, that actually came from Italy, has a harvest date on it.
2909 2018-08-09 18:31:06 The government of Ecuador has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Richie Sambora in a nainsook wig.
2910 2018-08-09 18:31:02 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.

2920 2018-08-09 18:29:52 Dead right BBC are not covering fracking. They only cover the "disruptive protectors". Let's face it BBC are a mouthpiece for the establishment. But are dangerously opinion forming #fracking #media #bbcshameonyou #oil
2921 2018-08-09 18:29:47 One cup of coconut oil and 5 drops of each other one and 1 tbsp of baking soda but most of the time I be too lazy to do this and I use just one. Rose water is good when u wash ur face throughout the day
2922 2018-08-09 18:29:45 "Extra virgin olive oil! It's never even heard of penis."
2923 2018-08-09 18:29:40 Yeah it only happens when it’s a convenient political strategy. Ontario and Quebec buy oil from Saudi’s and sell them weapons. So it’s not a genuine position.
2924 2018-08-09 18:29:38 If you calculate the price of crude oil then and the subsided  pump price compared to the price of the crude oil  now and pump price plus income from Stamp duty, you will understand that the assessment is just subjective .l
2925 2018-08-09 18:29:17 Oh, shit. I've had friends suggest CBD oil & say it's worked for them, but I've never tried it.

2940 2018-08-09 18:27:43 Thanks to Montreal jerks we can’t pipe western oil to the east.  Shows such a lack of common sense to stop a pipeline west to east.  What morons made the decision.
2941 2018-08-09 18:27:39 Are you applying beard oil?
2942 2018-08-09 18:27:30 @5minutesformom @LibertyMutual  Some things may be common sense to you, is not. Changing a tire, oil, and insurance info etc #letsmasterthis
2943 2018-08-09 18:27:28 Soooo you're blaming the US, specifically Obama, because your country can't sell oil to others?
How about wanting to work on your own country to be able to get profits OUTSIDE of the US since selling with us doesn't seem worth it
2944 2018-08-09 18:27:21 If Trudeau is so concerned about Saudi's human right records of jailing activists why not call for a boycott of Saudi Audi oil and encourage the world to buy ethical Canadian oil? Oh, wait..then we would need pipelines to tidewater....
2945 2018-08-09 18:27:16 Just like oil, crypto currencies will probably be in a new bull market before gold is.
2946 2018-08-09 18:27:14 I am not much for measuring if I don’t have to but I guess start with a tablespoon of all the liquid ingredients and adjust to taste. Maybe 2 tbsp of the sesame oil.
2947 2018-08-09 18:27:07 I’m not sure you understand why we don’t have the refinement capacity. Hint...it’s related to market agreements. The U.S. only wants to buy our raw oil and Asia can obtain cheaper oil from neighboring countries. 

But we do have an opportunity to lead in alternative energies.
2948 2018-08-09 18:26:53 I still don’t understand why we use petrol as our main fuel source. *closes the multitude of tabs each with their own oil spill announcement*
2949 2018-08-09 18:26:44 We’ll see. The dry weather has played silly buggers with his feet. He’s on Formula 4 feet, has hoof oil and pine tar on his frogs but still they’re cracking.
2950 2018-08-09 18:26:39 Very unusually many frequent meetings with KSA since our PM came to leadership.  Curious minds want to know what is so critical to require this level of time and effort from our busy PM? Is it oil supply? Al Amoudi? GERD?

2954 2018-08-09 18:26:30 Absolutely correct add to that the 100 million or so the United States make off of Canadian oil!

2956 2018-08-09 18:26:24 And they have clout.  About a third of the USA are also following what CA does,  Why not?  Clean is better all around for everyone (well, except for the oil and gas jerks).
2957 2018-08-09 18:26:21 A10: Prevent tick bites outside by using EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, IR3535, or 2-undecanone; avoiding grassy, brushy, or wooded areas; and by walking in the center of trails. #ThingsThatBiteKC
2958 2018-08-09 18:26:15 Canada's response should have been to stop purchasing oil from Saudi Arabia. Who in their right mind helps fund  the attacks against oneself? Canada is able to be energy independent if leftists  were  not bent on cutting of their nose despite their face.
2959 2018-08-09 18:26:13 No. You're paid to *advocate* on behalf of of the Oil & Gas industry.

That's why you don't publish criticisms of pro-oil & gas stories.

One way journalism is different than advocacy: Journalists don't make publishing decisions based on who is helped/hurt by them. #copolitics

2963 2018-08-09 18:25:50 It would we fun to have this separated by type of natural resource. Also, does this accounts for non-renewable resources like oil or gold? I am assuming yes but I want to be sure.

2983 2018-08-09 18:23:49 Lets see, before it was restricted, Asbestos was required. Before the Cuyahoga caught fire, it was illegal to sue oil companies for environmental damage. And you want government to decide things for us?

2990 2018-08-09 18:23:10 Unrelated issues. But the infrastructure will never happen without a market to sell finished goods. No one wants our finished goods, in those sectors. But we still have a golden opportunity to lead in alternative energies. We need to give the middle finger to oil nations!

2995 2018-08-09 18:22:36 @HLaverdiereNPD So sorry you are leaving politics.  I agree that Canada should stop supplying Saudi Arabia with arms but I also believe we shouldn't buy our oil from them. We should use Alberta's oil and not sell it out of country. We buy oil from US but they could increase the $

3023 2018-08-09 18:19:26 Tell the Saudis to shove their oil up their backsides and Canada purchase oil from Iran. This is turning into a dog eat dog world and Canada should look after itself. When the Brits or Americans next start their next war(s) Canada must tell them you're on your own.

3029 2018-08-09 18:18:56 My grandmother, who would be 102 if she was still alive, would tell him to go fuck himself and she grew up in the era of that BS. I can sew a button and change the oil in my car because my grandparents raised me to be independent.
3030 2018-08-09 18:18:55 ## How India will depend upon other Countries for Crude Oil ?? Since after so many years of our Independence,India made a little progress in exploration and extraction of Crude Oil from our Country itself. An immediate Strategy must be chalked out for indigenous Production.

3035 2018-08-09 18:18:10 Saudi Arabia can do whatever it wants in the region bc of 2 reasons 1) oil 2) its close and long established relationship with US.
3036 2018-08-09 18:18:06 My guess your a Harper (conservative) fan.  We all remember what he did to Canada, it wasn't good for us...only for Alberta's oil industry and wealthy.
3037 2018-08-09 18:18:05 I need to buy tea candles and scented oil
3038 2018-08-09 18:18:01 I think a better analogy would be "Mr. Wiz dunking our heads in a pot of boiling oil because we had final smashes legal for 2 weeks and thought it was cool"
3039 2018-08-09 18:17:48 I’m sitting here getting my oil changed and this man’s wife calls him and the ringtone goes “YOUR BOSS IS TRYING TO REACH YOU” followed by a bunch of beeps...Hahahaha
3040 2018-08-09 18:17:47 A bit strong! All we've ever done is sell weapons to a bunch of medieval fascists wishing to enforce their religious beliefs in order to ensure they keep the oil supplies coming.
3041 2018-08-09 18:17:42 So he like well I tell you what ima make this this your first time oil change and you won’t pay anything for it 
3042 2018-08-09 18:17:31 By the way, took my Corium Baobab pil & Avocado oil to the dermo, she vouched for them said they have some really good stuff in them. But treatment may be required to deal with any skin infections causing the acne.

3044 2018-08-09 18:17:24 Driving after an oil change is one of the best feelings
3045 2018-08-09 18:17:17 Clips like this always make me wonder -- and I'm not terribly aligned with @Ocasio2018 on policy, per se -- how many sincere, world-changing ppl fall through the political cracks? We, as voters, are prone to saccharine snake oil.
3046 2018-08-09 18:17:14 We're really mad, but not stop the oil shipments mad.
3047 2018-08-09 18:17:13 Pro oil, anti electric hitpiece anyone?
3048 2018-08-09 18:16:56 WHYISFOODSOEXPENSIVEATLUCASOIL!!!
3049 2018-08-09 18:16:54 Also, don't forget it's the major oil companies that have to build.  The important issue is that instead of concentrating on fossil fuels we should be more concerned with transitioning to "renewable energy".
3050 2018-08-09 18:16:52 Why are people still using coconut oil as lotion? Coconut oil is not a moisturizer, it’s a sealant. It seals moisture, not moisturize! Can cause break outs also
3051 2018-08-09 18:16:48 So he looks at me like so you alway paid for your oil change I’m like uhhh yea ,
3052 2018-08-09 18:16:45 I dont walk well on palm or vegetable oil, i like sunflower oil + 5w 40
3053 2018-08-09 18:16:37 Th Liberals didn't think twice about banning tankers carrying AB oil but won't do the same for Saudi oil. What to make of that I wonder?
3054 2018-08-09 18:16:35 It's either politics or oil job.  Nothing else
3055 2018-08-09 18:16:21 Energy East didn’t fly because the Liberals re-staffed the NEB so new rules like “destination emissions” for Alberta oil were invented to force T.C. to back away. These “rules” never applied to imported oil from Saudi, Russia, Venezuela because needed a way to kill Right Whales?
3056 2018-08-09 18:16:14 Now playing: 'BEDS ARE BURNING' by 'MIDNIGHT OIL'
3057 2018-08-09 18:16:00 We are sitting on an amazing God given bounty of oil reserves in ND (bigger than Saudi Arabia) so what do we do? 
 
We build stupid ugly wasteful wind turbines all over the state!
 
Amazingly idiotic policy. I'd much rather look at an oil well - at least that makes sense.

3064 2018-08-09 18:15:15 Dumb Propaganda.  And not correct.  The USA is energy independent at this very moment.  We are producing more oil than we consume.  We have VAST reserves.  We have become an exporter, not an importer of energy.
3065 2018-08-09 18:15:08 The Irvings have an oil terminal here in N.B. where they pump Saudi oil from barges and refine it. In my 63 years I don't recall a single event of an oil spill. The Orcas are in greater danger from your fishnets, and fish farms. #usesomelogic

3067 2018-08-09 18:14:56 "Canada processes only a fraction of its own crude oil
production. Most of the refineries in Canada, built when there were abundant supplies of light crude oil, were not configured to process growing volumes of heavy crude oil from the oil sands. "

3069 2018-08-09 18:14:54 You have the appreciation of many people here but I doubt you'll get it from our government due to them having lots of oil money to buy weapons off us.

3073 2018-08-09 18:14:42 No oo ..anointing oil is olive oil
3074 2018-08-09 18:14:38 So you're mad because we didn't wanna buy dirty oil? I have no sympathy for that, because I am for renewable energy

Will you still be pissy when we go that route in the future?

It's not our fault that Canada decided to only sell to us, that's not a smart or safe business move

3078 2018-08-09 18:14:12 Western Canadians have been raising the issue of ethical oil for years, but it took a Twitter spat for Ottawa to truly understanding the importance of this issue. The Liberal government is just so myopic it’s laughable.

3083 2018-08-09 18:13:47 If every European country and Australia Canada Japan NewZealnd UK and USA criticized Saudis for human right violations - will Saudis stop doing business with everyone of them? No.
If all those countries stop buying Saudi oil, what will the Saudis do? They will have to change.

3085 2018-08-09 18:13:45 There’s only one explanation for this Space Force stuff: NASA has found out that the aliens have oil.
3086 2018-08-09 18:13:35 If carbon dioxide is so good let’s all just burn oil and tires.
3087 2018-08-09 18:13:34 There's no point in arguing with you. You are 100% vested in electric cars. A combination of electric, ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen would work wouldn't it? I forgot - big oil hates hydrogen. Ask Ballard.
3088 2018-08-09 18:13:32 tell the saudi minister to drop dead, and cancel saudi oil imports.

3093 2018-08-09 18:12:56 "Opening" those lands to oil drilling doesn't mean oil will be drilled. If it's environmentally sensitive, legal fees will eat into profit margins. Workers must be transported, housed and insured in remote areas. It's expensive work. Which is why we need to keep oil prices low!

3095 2018-08-09 18:12:31 Taking a break from $TSLA - Nustar ( $NS ) will be back in the mid 30's or higher by this time next year if oil stays above $60.
3096 2018-08-09 18:12:24 Ha ha, particularly with people brainwashed by oil co.'s propaganda! Pumping out massive amounts of raw bitumen without refining has put Alberta in the position it's in. Hoping some mythical buyers from Asia will save the day is hilarious! None of the issues if refined first.

3119 2018-08-09 18:10:54 For me of my faves is toasted sesame oil, browned garlic, tamarind, soy and ginger. And a few sliced spring onions on top. But yes, just with good soy and also ginger is lovely

3125 2018-08-09 18:09:27 I would love to see #him lathered up in some coconut oil after a shower, making his way to bed, skin just glistening. 

But, most straight black men haven’t moisturized their thighs, ass, or torso since their mama used to do it for them, so I’ll just keep dreaming.
3126 2018-08-09 18:09:19 Russia by 2030. That would mean a real impactful measures. Right now there are no coincise measures, and EU countries can buy as much gas and oil as before 2014. It only made harder to conduct business for russian oligarchs, but it doesnt prevent gas/oil imports as you said.
3127 2018-08-09 18:09:16 Of course it won’t because they want our cash... beside oil and sand what do they have there anyway?
3128 2018-08-09 18:08:57 Can you bring coconut oil on the plane? @TSA asking for a friend.... 
3129 2018-08-09 18:08:48 It is more hard so as the world knows how much of a pushover we are as a nation.  Nationally and internationally. We are a fucking laughing stock with no recourse and zero options. They know we will still buy billions in oil.

3132 2018-08-09 18:08:27 But buying $1M of foreign Saudi oil per day shipped over the ocean is ok. It’s not like we have any of our own. (Sarcasm in case you didn’t get it)
3133 2018-08-09 18:08:24 I am talking about the oil based politics of 70+ years. Did you just wake up?
3134 2018-08-09 18:08:24 Nope, not nonsense. Spent six years running for president, not helping TX. Worst legislative record in all of the Senate. And by worst, I mean fewest laws and least money brought to his state.

Go ask the oil and gas guys what we think of him...
3135 2018-08-09 18:08:23 Also, huge fan love your stuff. I just wanted to throw that idea about oil and gas hating Tesla out there.
3136 2018-08-09 18:08:18 Laying in the same position for hours on end may be part of your issue, try different positioning such as sleeping with your feet up as it reduces tension on the #spine. #Brain fog is known to cause #zebras a lot of trouble waking up and moving in the AM. Have you tried #CBD oil?
3137 2018-08-09 18:08:13 Why hasn't the iranian government tried using bitcoin to get around sanctions?  Or is that a lot harder than it seems?  The most obvious thing to do would be to accept bitcoin in payment of an oil shipment. There must also be a lot of less obvious things they could do.
3138 2018-08-09 18:08:07 One day there oil will be worthless that day can’t come fast enough Stone Age morons
3139 2018-08-09 18:07:53 It’s impossible to believe that our great government will continue buying the oil from Saudi!! that is going to devastate our image all over the world again. Please note that we have oil and a lot of oil.   
3140 2018-08-09 18:07:29 ||Hope she feels better soon, you can try massaging her there with oil. My mother always asks me to massage her there when she feels pain, and if its coming from the stomach you can feed her yogurt to clean her stomach from any food poisoning
3141 2018-08-09 18:07:28 Would that be why oil/ gasoline price mysteriously came down? They too thought your production had stumbled?
3142 2018-08-09 18:07:00 This is a false flag operation! Alex jones is a crisis actor! He deleted the accounts himself to spread fear among the snake oil consuming community!

3144 2018-08-09 18:06:53 It looks like pizza so it must be evil! You'd show them a nice plate with sliced mozza (mixed with tomato julienne), some olive oil, a dab of cream cheese, couple of slices of prosciutto and two hard boiled eggs, they'd probably call it "healthy keto" or something.
3145 2018-08-09 18:06:48 Really thankful that i landed myself in my current company, as my current position in my current area and shift.
Now just hope the oil&gas market dont flip. 
3146 2018-08-09 18:06:46 Of course it won't.  That's free money for them. Stop all trade with this unjust society. Buy Canadian wake up Justin. Force the eastern provinces to buy Canadian oil #cdnpoli
3147 2018-08-09 18:06:39 of-course the end goal is to build the pipeline, did you not know US economy runs on Oil?
3148 2018-08-09 18:06:39 @CandiceMalcolm AB now has an extensive surplus BC PQ R resisting AB because when AB should have been sharing instead they told Canadians 'it is our oil keep UR hands off' resulting in the Maritimes & east importing 56% of Can oil  AB wants every one to play nice BOO HOO
3149 2018-08-09 18:06:36 Although most of the 9/11 hijackers came from SA it’s the one middle eastern country we haven’t bombed.  It goes deeper than oil I’m afraid.  We are connected to them politically at the hip.
3150 2018-08-09 18:06:34 It’s the game.  Since every oil purchase must be made in USA dollars, everything from exchange rates to supply and demand are in play. Why do you think your Loonie is worth 3/4 of a Murikan dollar?

3152 2018-08-09 18:06:10 Yes I'm obsessed with shea butter. I use it to moisturise and seal. Mix it with some castor oil and hair lotion for fragrance and apply to freshly washed hair before I twist it up. I do this once a week.
3153 2018-08-09 18:05:41 There are entire cities and states that are literally famous for their corruption. They are all - every single one - 100% in the control of Democrats.
3154 2018-08-09 18:05:36 Where is irritating Elon Musk?  We need electric cars NOW from someone somewhere, so we don’t have to kneel to the Saudi Royal Family for their oil anymore.

3178 2018-08-09 18:04:12 Check out how talented Peter Höhsl is with his paintbrush. He works with oil paints on canvas and you can see some complete works, some progress shots and some close-ups here. :)
3179 2018-08-09 18:04:08 A slippery slope: When saturation occurs (for example what's happening in CO) due to CSA law, CBD is lucrative since there are no plant limits. Yes it's important, but yes snake oil exists & to demonize a cannabinoid of the same plant for being 'psychoactive' is counterproductive
3180 2018-08-09 18:04:00 It's been so long since I've done PCR that I keep looking for the mineral oil.
3181 2018-08-09 18:03:54 UGH I’m working on it! I’m at least trying to get some kind of CBD oil and work up from there. But I’m also allergic to hemp so I don’t know if that’s like a problem or not??
3182 2018-08-09 18:03:25 Still can't stress this enough @PlantTherapy is phenomenal! Anyone else agree?! What's your favorite oil?
3183 2018-08-09 18:03:15 Its a good habbit to have. That tractor blows oil out the breather pipe so you need to keep an eye on it. All the machines have a sign on it. I also put the keys on the dip stick to help the habbit to set
3184 2018-08-09 18:03:14 I'm a libertarian but America doesn't give shit about human life, they are after Venezuelan oil. What about Lebanon?
3185 2018-08-09 18:03:10 So....those of us who see that.....have to resist! Hey, if we can make an engine steam on crappy coal (or oil!) we can do this!

3188 2018-08-09 18:03:01 Putin has a presidential candidate who is in his pocket. He is unscrupulous, corrupt, cash poor, and stupid. He is the perfect useful idiot. Get him into office, and he might help lift the sanctions on a trillion dollars in oil revenues. All he has to do is beat Hillary.
3189 2018-08-09 18:03:00 100% lol that shit got castor oil in it.
3190 2018-08-09 18:02:51 It is because that time the rate of crude oil was 120 USD Per barrel and today it is 50 USD per barrel and Only Delhi doesn't come in India. India has 29 states. 
so, Stop Your Illogical comments.
Get some info and then comment.
3191 2018-08-09 18:02:07 Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic dispute with Canada over its arrest of women’s rights activists will not affect the ultraconservative kingdom’s oil sales to Canadian customers, the Saudi energy minister said Thursday.

3193 2018-08-09 18:01:51 I just spent $47.50 for gas, $97.80 for an oil change and some other things & there’s still so much wrong with my car.... LOL
3194 2018-08-09 18:01:46 I haven't. I've read Last Light, about oil running out. Similar nightmare.

3199 2018-08-09 18:01:31 I would like to take a nap, but apparently Sheboygan construction found oil in my street.
3200 2018-08-09 18:01:30 Hey Manny did you know that eastern Canadian refineries could buy US oil for the same price as Saudi oil, the eastern refineries might not be able to refine bitumen from Alberta but they can refine US oil easily. What's up with that? Saudi friends @irvingoil
3201 2018-08-09 18:01:21 I'll bet that the one tragedy of an oil laden train destroying the lives of the citizens in Lac Megantique Quebec eclipses any problem we've ever had from the 65 year old pipeline currently pumping oil to B.C. from Alberta #KeepCanadaWorking
3202 2018-08-09 18:01:16 Saudi official says the Canada dispute won’t affect oil sales.
3203 2018-08-09 18:01:10 Kinder Morgan wasn’t bailing because of BC. It was the excuse it’s been looking for since the discovery and approval to get more oil in the US, combined with the size of massive ship that can now be used in the Gulf which will never make it through the coast of BC.  @NTLNewsWatch

3205 2018-08-09 18:01:02 Character probably refers to type of character, as in cowboys, harlots, snake oil men, officers of the law, etc.
3206 2018-08-09 18:00:54 I know what you write.  I follow you.  The US will soon be petroleum independent.  Why would we care about SA's oil now?  We now want to work with SA to stabilize the ME and quash terrorism.  That's a bad thing?

3209 2018-08-09 18:00:32 Correct. Perhaps I didn’t state my point as well as I could have. While yes the mitigation of pollution is achieved, you are still using physically more methane than you would heavier hydrocarbons. You still pay the oil and gas companies money, and it’s almost net even.

3213 2018-08-09 18:00:14 Vape Liquid is (in order of volume) Vegetable Glycerine, Propylene Glycol (anti-freeze), flavourings (usually oil based) and nicotine.

They do have some definite health issues, look up popcorn lung.
3214 2018-08-09 18:00:09 Cooking oil should do the trick.
3215 2018-08-09 18:00:07 this should recover soon. Its faster to get fuel to #India from Iran. #Iran is a safer bet, economically. #Oil #Wars
3216 2018-08-09 18:00:03 Ive just looked through your feed and you seemed to literally dare them to do it.  You kind of asked for it. You have an agenda and are pushing that.  They are not pushing any agenda they just seem to be taking out the ones peddling snake oil in their name.  Seems fair enough
3217 2018-08-09 17:59:53 what about your maca?! come here i have some oil that will help

3220 2018-08-09 17:59:38 True but we do we keep buying it from them. We need to find other sources so we are less dependent on Saudi oil.
3221 2018-08-09 17:59:37 Seems like a ripoff: Gas & Oil go down big past few days on mkt.  Jax. Co. Pump prices go up 25 cents/gal. 3.09 A Crime!  @MLive #Highwayrobbery @dh2280 @realDonaldTrump @onetoughnerd
3222 2018-08-09 17:59:30 In the end it matters how they are being cooked. I find most veggies deeply dipped in pre_pre_pre_heated oil and that sucks.
3223 2018-08-09 17:59:29 And that right there is the root issue. We need to break free from our independence on foreign oil. Greed will inprison us all.
3224 2018-08-09 17:58:54 This technique has been used to extinguish gas and oil fires in the past. It’s very likely to be successful in this use case as well. Plus we get to bomb out CA at the same time, relieving some stress /s :-)
3225 2018-08-09 17:58:52 The main beneficiaries of the Trudeau government are other oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. 

It’s in their self interest to create this conflict.
3226 2018-08-09 17:58:50 Listen I use Apricot oil for my face and hair and I’m now immortal
3227 2018-08-09 17:58:47 Highly possible. Try massaging it with a mixture of olive oil and warm water. Usually an itchy flakey sculpt is a result of dryness
3228 2018-08-09 17:58:41 I always forget to turn my music off when I go get my oil changed so today the guy is gonna hear Brendon sing “show me your love” and honestly? He should feel blessed
3229 2018-08-09 17:58:34 It took us 700 years to reinvent the steam engine after Alexandria was sacked. It took 3000 years for modern medicine to admit Willow bark works because it has aspirin in it. It's taken 100 years to go back to using soybean oil in diesel engine. God only knows what has been lost.

3239 2018-08-09 17:57:20 I got the lip palette and it's great! The cuticle oil though.....I'm a nail girl. Use very sparingly. I got excited and pit a drop on each cuticle. I had enough for my hands and My daughters! Smells nice too. Wish you would send some amazing nail polishes...that would be awesome!
3240 2018-08-09 17:57:18 Crime? So who's going to charge them... Waiting. Let's face it, the only reason why euros have been backing the jihadist scum is because their backers have oil. That's the only reason.
3241 2018-08-09 17:57:15 I got ridiculed for posting a recipe we love and make all the time that has olive oil in it so

3251 2018-08-09 17:55:41 Do a video on the oil cooler. I want one on mine but am hesitant.
3252 2018-08-09 17:55:32 In 1917 importance of oil was not known It was in 1938 when oil was discovered in Saudia.Balfour Declaration was made in 1917 much before oil discovery and Israel  is still not a big source of oil.
3253 2018-08-09 17:55:29 So what he is saying is... boycott Saudi oil.

3262 2018-08-09 17:54:28 Three adults in that house.

Put an end to oil production, that would be a brave thing to do. 
3263 2018-08-09 17:54:14 Would be a complete Diva.. “Where the FUCK is my baby oil!?!??!”
3264 2018-08-09 17:54:12 I used to work in construction and in oil refineries. You simply don't want the stuff around, short cuts were done 10 years ago and it's certainly sure with less regulations today there's short cuts getting ready to happen today for profit.
3265 2018-08-09 17:53:55 You all oil your pots?
3266 2018-08-09 17:53:47 Dollar Tree spices are a good hack; if there's an Aldi by you they have good prices on oils, vinegar, and basically all condiments. You can get $1 olive oil at Dollar Tree but you can get a much larger better quality EVO at Aldi for like $2.29

3268 2018-08-09 17:53:30 Hmm. Wasn't Obama president when Russia invaded the Ukraine and Crimea? Trump has provided weapons to the Ukraine, imposed sanctions several times on Russia, increased our oil output, which hurts Russia, increased our military spending and gone after EU for BUYING gas from Russia
3269 2018-08-09 17:53:28 But oil companies do set the thermostat on planet earth...
3270 2018-08-09 17:53:24 I had to put coconut oil on my face so that my skin wouldn’t peel and it could be moisturized, but that coupled with the heat is causing my glasses to slide off my nose and I think this is my own unique hell.
3271 2018-08-09 17:53:18 They need their oil revenues don’t they?
3272 2018-08-09 17:53:13 Degradation? On a power cable? You really think that .01% loss matters? Go away with the snake oil.
3273 2018-08-09 17:53:05 IMO. All planned.Trudeau helping his MB Iran. Old: Badawi was in prison since 2012. New: Trump not funding Iran ISIS activities. Hensaf (raif's wife) comes for asylum and gets citizenship.Trudeau comes to Iran's rescue. Insults Saudi over sister in law. Next? Import oil from Iran
3274 2018-08-09 17:52:53 Oh my my! I want to rub that booty down with oil and spend some time on it
3275 2018-08-09 17:52:49 Let's sell the strategic oil reserve to my friends. I'll get a good price!
3276 2018-08-09 17:52:47 Things the US has money for:
- Space Force (Farce)
- More military spending than next 8 countries combined
- $12B on Farmer bailouts
- $18.5B in Oil & Gas subsidies

Things the US can't afford:
- Medicare/Medicaid
- Social Security
- Relief for Puerto Rico
- Clean H2O for Flint
3277 2018-08-09 17:52:42 I'm there. I was experimenting with making cannabis oil last night and STG I'm still high and I think Satan tryna eat my ass.

3278 2018-08-09 17:52:35 What about gamecaster (I know, sounds weird, right)?

Definitely would be helpful to have a term that differentiates someone who streams games, someone who reviews games, and someone that posts youtube videos of creating oil paintings...
3279 2018-08-09 17:52:21 Have you tried a specific soap for your face to help cleanse and cut down the oil?

3288 2018-08-09 17:51:34 The Energy East void bungle, we can't even transport our own oil, might yet haunt that inept Liberal disaster.. Now beholden to Saudi. How colossally dumb is that? You can't even make this up!
3289 2018-08-09 17:51:28 Saving the environment aka securing dependency on conflict oil from middle east and conducting smear campaign (foreign funded) on un-favoured politicians ...
Just saying
3290 2018-08-09 17:51:23 @nkoleszar As a 1st gen, what's the oil consumption like after rework? [via BB Passport]
3291 2018-08-09 17:51:22 Do you think Exxon seeks to secure supply of sweet crude ( a bet on  IMO2020 ), or hedge towards possible falling oil prices in the coming years ?
3292 2018-08-09 17:50:53 That’s crazy! I stopped using dermatologist products + pills and now everything except my facial oil is from a drug store/amazon and my skin is sooo much better haha

3294 2018-08-09 17:50:32 oil before becoming a clear definition of the types of care when in the office very well in the pool a lot, but the pool is?  rate is just worship?  fan of, is the attitude and really good or for the laws of flowers, the case of the best
3295 2018-08-09 17:50:18 Vegetables oil
3296 2018-08-09 17:50:13 oh! and the oil doesn't go in the bagels. it's for oiling the bowl.
3297 2018-08-09 17:50:06 True, at least for a period of time, oil companies received payments/rebates from UK government ie actually being paid to extract oil.
3298 2018-08-09 17:49:55 The land you are talking about is our land, we are who brought you to pump out our oil with our money like slaves is that your dignity? ,and the  freedom and death culture that you speak of, go back to history,To know who killed the Native Americans.
3299 2018-08-09 17:49:50 I think I'm safe enough too... 
3300 2018-08-09 17:49:44 Throw some Zinc oxide on that puppy. It draws out the oil. Also toothpaste helps, minty cooling feeling. Also maybe try tea tree oil. :(
3301 2018-08-09 17:49:41 No oil, huh? Bummer.
3302 2018-08-09 17:49:41 Gettin an oil change right now and there is a family in here with both parents and two kids. They are being BAD AF. One of them won't sit down, the other one has a jolly ranger stick in his hands and he just licking it getting it all of his hands, telling his sister she's fat,
3303 2018-08-09 17:49:36 Listen, do you want breathable air or increased oil company profits? 

(The GOP: Increased oil company profits!)
3304 2018-08-09 17:49:33 Lol I don't think the lie of "bringing democracy" works anymore. Nobody dumb enough to believe that. Gaddafi wanted to sell oil in Euro and not the US dollar $$$. The promised him the world if he gave up his nukes. He did. Then they killed him. That's why nobody trusts the US.
3305 2018-08-09 17:49:32 I love getting my oil changed bc the chances of them getting my car started on the first try are slim to none but I get in it & can start it right up 
3306 2018-08-09 17:49:29 HEY, IF THEY'RE LIARS, WE DON'T NEED THEIR SNAKE OIL ANYWAY!  WE HAVE THE INTERNET , WHICH IS THE CLOSEST THING TO A 'FREE PRESS' THERE WILL EVER BE- WE NEED TO KEEP THE INTERNET FREE AND OPEN, -TO DEMONSTRATE HOW A FREE COUNTRY'S SUPPOSED TO WORK!
3307 2018-08-09 17:49:27 You are sheaa not sunni and of course you want to put fire on oil so that you can have advantage. Remember that iran your country has worst relationships with canada than we do.
3308 2018-08-09 17:49:26 This is a single crime and has been preceded by many crimes over the past 4 years but the silence of the world and the oil states dollars is working to silence the world and close their eyes

3315 2018-08-09 17:48:30 What a battle out there, but #TigerWoods is leaking oil and I can't see him going from humidity to icebath and being able to keep his energy for 54 more holes. #PGAChamp

3318 2018-08-09 17:48:25 I used snake oil salesman at the dealership the other day when I went back to bitch about them hosing me on my new vehicle. Got me a newer better one.  I may have also told them I was going to talk to a lawyer as well cause I needed someone who would actually talk to me.

3322 2018-08-09 17:48:11 On the other hand.......

The recent Saudi spat is all the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later. 

So eventually we can stop importing Saudi Oil!!

The sooner we become energy self-sufficient the better our economy will become.

3327 2018-08-09 17:47:28 Pakistan has always stood with Saudis and it has more to do with over 2 millions Pakistanis working there and sometimes their oil on deferred payments. 

A large contingent of army also deployed there for some time. Pakistan unlikely to bid them farewell anytime soon
3328 2018-08-09 17:47:25 How many Saudis in Canada's oil patch be heading home. Just wondering
3329 2018-08-09 17:47:04 Kitchens also have spatulas, crockpots and canola oil.  These are also things that would be bizarre to do a maternity photo shoot with.

3332 2018-08-09 17:46:56 Be careful of too much oil. It will raise your LDL,  not as much as meat though. Vascular disease is still a big killer of vegans. Unfortunately we have to go low-oil for great heart health, even though oil tastes good.

3336 2018-08-09 17:46:32 There is oil off NFL and Venezuela has plenty so why do we have to get oil from Saudi Arabia?
3337 2018-08-09 17:46:28 I put something up so i wouldn’t throw it away and still threw it away. Why am i like this? I need to start taking fish oil tablets again.
3338 2018-08-09 17:46:19 LOL oh bab!!! It’s honestly not. It’s very dry and relies heavily on ‘oil masks’ every night! 
3339 2018-08-09 17:46:02  I had read all the blurb and had such high hopes for it too! I’ve only just grown my lashes back after badgal bang destroyed them so I’m a bit wary of waterproof mascara and having to work too hard to remove it. Castor oil in a clean mascara tube has worked miracles btw! Xxx
3340 2018-08-09 17:46:01 Whoa! I’m gonna start on some fish oil.
3341 2018-08-09 17:45:58 Yesterday I went to @jiffylube for an oil change and the employees lied and told me my tire had a hole in it and was leaking air to try to get me to buy one of theirs. My tire hasn’t leaked any air in the past 24 hours. Don’t let them try to upsell you

3345 2018-08-09 17:45:32 when we are in a bust cycle they STILL produce... do you think they just go home and shut everything down?  We sold product to well servicing supplies when oil was $27.

3357 2018-08-09 17:43:23 So, that means one day oil will be freaking expensive, Saudi will be empty and Canada still will have some oil
3358 2018-08-09 17:43:20 That isn't true. Less regulation leads to things like the disaster oil trainker in Quebec because Harper's conservitaves nixed rail inspectors and left that work up to the companies. How many died? How about some citations?
3359 2018-08-09 17:43:20 Ha Ha Ha Syria, oil pipeline, etc, etc. Fancy words for do nothing politicians n but smacking pals.

3382 2018-08-09 17:39:56 CANADA should have STOPPED getting oil from such "infants" that run Saudi Arabia a LONG TIME AGO...NOW is the chance
3383 2018-08-09 17:39:55 the feeling after your car gets an oil change  #Racemeyoubitch
3384 2018-08-09 17:39:52 If you woke up feeling lethargic or even prone to wanting to sleep again two hours after waking, make a cup of green tea. Add coconut oil for an additional energy boost if you're doing intermittent fasting or carb cycling.
3385 2018-08-09 17:39:50 Let me guess, you will prefer to use crude oil too, rather than refined oil. And you are also a farmer cultivating and planting with hoe and cutlass. And how is pointing out you need to help out for your home shifting towards colonialism again?

3390 2018-08-09 17:39:25 Hey Ted. Looks like your light bulb burned out. You could have used more Alberta Oil to keep it alight. Don't wade into a complicated convo without the background. You will lose.
3391 2018-08-09 17:38:58 Spending the first morning of my vacation getting my oil changed and new spark plugs for my jeep. Very exciting
3392 2018-08-09 17:38:54 There’s no intelligent answers for that. They will avoid oil talk.
3393 2018-08-09 17:38:53 Thank you senator for injecting some logic into the conversation. I live in the maritimes where our largest oil & gas refineries are fueled by Saudi oil. I wonder how much carbon emissions from barges, trains, and tractor trailers  would be reduced with a pipeline?
3394 2018-08-09 17:38:50 I doubt any one person knows all the patents they have.

Feel free to contact them & ask. I'm not an expert. Just know from doing research for shares that they cornered a lot of tech already.

Shell have forseen the need for a different energy source to oil. Not rocket science.
3395 2018-08-09 17:38:42 There's no reason to depend on or buy those countries oil. Many other suppliers and we can build pipelines to get to our refineries. We choose not to.
3396 2018-08-09 17:38:25 Explain what you understand by Dy/Dx

Ans:
Building a refinery in the north for oil that is in the south and cow ranches in the south for cows in the north. Dy/dx

3398 2018-08-09 17:38:09 It's not a great look for SA. They're desperately trying to diversify away from oil but this will make foreign investors very nervous. The jinn is out of the bottle now so Canada just has to make the best of it.
3399 2018-08-09 17:38:08 I’m also a big fan of the artichoke with oil and vinegar

3406 2018-08-09 17:37:42 Only in my house! But we medical here but oil and vape only.
3407 2018-08-09 17:37:31 For manageability I would say only deal with the hair in small sections, be gentle and detangle from tip to root. For moisture I say water/moisture first, then follow up with an oil/butter. Do a simple twist over night. Good luck. I hope that was useful
3408 2018-08-09 17:37:27 huh. maybe I broke mine somehow... i never get more than the ghost of some oil out of the little brushy thing.

3428 2018-08-09 17:35:30 Aww Wookie, you need some treats to oil that squeak sweetheart! x
3429 2018-08-09 17:35:21 Thank you @NinaKilbride for your thorough presentation and all the work you've done in this space.

Very interested in trying out the Agreement Network's no-code smart contract builder tool, especially in the realm of oil & gas leasing. #BlockLegalTech
3430 2018-08-09 17:35:21 Если не нужно — не ходи. Это бред, про то, что ценный опыт, и всё такое. Как говорил Шерлок, наш мозг — огромный чердак. Дурак заполнит его всяким хламом, а не дурак, нормально всё отсортирует. Короче. Лучше Снэйла посмотри. Хоть настроение улучшишь
3431 2018-08-09 17:35:17 Around the world, people think Dallas is the TV show: big ranches, oil wells, the Ewing family. @visit_dallas uses diversity stats to fight for who we really are & how we want to be seen: diverse & welcoming to all.  #PRDiversity #PRSADallas
3432 2018-08-09 17:35:16 Little makes me feel more like a “dumb girl” than getting an oil change. I’m doing some light research before I do this again.
3433 2018-08-09 17:35:10 sick ash can’t even get a oil change now 
3434 2018-08-09 17:35:03 - wash your hair 1-2 times a week          - use a detangler for when you get out the shower so your not ripping your hair 
- apply coconut oil 30 mins before washing your hair 
- drink WATER 
3435 2018-08-09 17:34:53  in ko es oil ki malish karo
3436 2018-08-09 17:34:23 tree oil .. กลิ่นเหี้ยมาก ;-;
3437 2018-08-09 17:34:18 If Not 'Fake News' Pakistan Has Taken Several Steps Forward, To Discover More And More Oil And Gas To Meet The 'Energy Needs' Of The Country, But This 'Newly Reported' Discovery Would Certainly Make A Worthwhile Difference, To Decrease The Energy Crisis, In Pakistan. Insha Allah!

3440 2018-08-09 17:34:08 Tip from LynetteCenee: a drop of olive oil on cuticles makes nails grow faster. #manicure
3441 2018-08-09 17:34:05 Riding the bus between two people talking on phones. I hope they are chatting with one another. 
Person A: Paprika and olive oil is all we need.

Person B: On the Iditarod? Really? Huh must be part of the healing process.

Person A: That’s my guess but I hate speculation.
3442 2018-08-09 17:33:57 OK to use Olive oil on my EDC tactical folder upper knife?
3443 2018-08-09 17:33:51 With everything that’s going on in the world rn u chose 2 write about this?!? Get your act together. Smh Btw I’m conservative too. Learn 2 write substance not foolishness. “Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom & honor”

3444 2018-08-09 17:33:49 my cramps r so bad my hand hurts bc i burned it and it smells like fish bc my mom thought itd be a good idea to put fish oil on it so in conclusion i cant stop crying
3445 2018-08-09 17:33:34 Any country annouce that they stand with #SaudiArabia in rejecting #Canada interference will be called by Canadians “backward country” “terrorist” “want oil or money” etc.

Their brain is limited to only one view and they believe that they know everything. Small brains large Egos
3446 2018-08-09 17:33:31 Is your scalp dry when you oil it? Remember, moisture first, then seal with oil. Oil on a dry scalp does not help. Start with some water and then add the oil as a possible solution. Let me know if it works out.
3447 2018-08-09 17:33:24 I never quite understood how gals put argan & castor oil on their remy, human and brazillian hair but edges & sides on peekaboo  WOW
3448 2018-08-09 17:33:23 “It’s a typewriter, child. Ribbon. Oil. Paper. Happy fingers. That’s all it needs.” @tomhanks
3449 2018-08-09 17:33:20 Uhhh I don’t want beeswax or castor oil on me lol
3450 2018-08-09 17:33:02 And then there's the illusion that there are some "very fine people" who are neo nazis, that Russia is our friend, that NK is nuke free, that the tRump Admin is transparent, that wages are soaring. The snake oil continues to flow from this @POTUS .
3451 2018-08-09 17:32:46 THERE ARE OTHER WASHES WHICH ARENT NULN OIL
3452 2018-08-09 17:32:43 It’s 10:30 and I feel like I already got a shit ton of stuff done. Tire replaced, oil change, new air filters. I’m adulting!
3453 2018-08-09 17:32:38 because our entire state is on fire, and @JerryBrownGov is right, this is our new normal. Our #climate is in crisis, and it is harming 100,000s of people already. We need to replace filthy #oil #gas & #coal with #cleanenergy NOW (actually, 25 years ago!)
3454 2018-08-09 17:32:27 OMG YES! I went for an oil change and they were like BY THE WAY you should probs fix that loose ball joint and maybe get your brake pads updated it’ll be $674 but  

I also considered driving until I HAD to take it in but Paul had other “safer” ideas
3455 2018-08-09 17:32:20 @jkenney has made clear, it's the Alberta Advantage track, where AB prosperity is tied to the price of crude oil, with no investment in infrastructure, diversification or the Heritage Trust Fund.
3456 2018-08-09 17:32:15 Shredded on an Italian sub. It holds the oil and vinegar nicely, adds crunch and a slight sweetness to balance against the hot peppers.
3457 2018-08-09 17:32:12 Sarah is honestly the best. She takes care of so much  at home while I’m 4 hours away at work. Gets oil changed, takes care of horses, laundry, keeps the house clean, cooks, takes trailers in for tires and the list goes on. All with one hand. Good lord I love that woman.
3458 2018-08-09 17:32:04 Is this the same Landry whose 2015 campaign was funded by more than 40 oil and gas companies, including Halliburton, Hilcorp Energy, Koch Industries and Phillips 66? Vested interests? Corruption? It's pretty clear for all to see. Shame on you
3459 2018-08-09 17:32:03 Stacy saying something is safe doesn't make it so - she's pontificating on J&J resorting to natural products but talc and asbestos (which is can be potent carcinogen) are both 100% natural in origin. So are coal tar, coconut oil and salicylic acid (cited in that scare story).
3460 2018-08-09 17:31:54 Its weird how every person that was once our ally suddenly turns into a "mad man" and its funny how they usually own oil
3461 2018-08-09 17:31:42 Exactly. If Canada would get it's shit together and create oil refineries we'd be set. But they'd rather spend money on convicted terrorists and hotels for #FakeRefugees
3462 2018-08-09 17:31:40 My dad delivered fuel oil and my mom was a school bus driver. Neither of them went to college. But both of them expected their six children to go to college and they worked hard to make it happen. I guess I thought all loving parents would want a better life for their children.
3463 2018-08-09 17:31:29 Alaskans own 150,053 shares of CARNARVON PETROLEUM LTD, worth $11,332. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in AUSTRALIA.

3465 2018-08-09 17:31:27 May’s husband is an investment banker who likely has holdings in Saudi oil companies. I’m sure they paid him off long ago
3466 2018-08-09 17:31:14 40$ oil change 
3467 2018-08-09 17:31:11 oh no! 
I had an olive oil pour-spout bottle that was packed. And leaked.
Good luck.
3468 2018-08-09 17:31:08 David that's old news! Clearly your Head is out of synchrony with current events. Suggest you use WD40 to oil the old cogs. Good Luck
3469 2018-08-09 17:31:05 If the fries aren’t fresh out the oil, ion want em!
3470 2018-08-09 17:31:04 I’m mad this twist out looking nice since I unraveled them with oil

3473 2018-08-09 17:31:01 The government of Guyana has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Isla Fisher in a c change wig.
3474 2018-08-09 17:31:01 It's better suited for the hair shaft.
My suggestion would be to make a blend of castor oil and olive oil and use that on your hairline.
3475 2018-08-09 17:30:54 Kirloskar Oil  sell below 250.60 down side target 233 to 229 stop loss 257.50 risky call only for Friday session
3476 2018-08-09 17:30:51 Meh, don’t really want any slave owning oil sheiks or Sketchy Russian oligarchs. Wouldn’t mind a buy out other than that.
3477 2018-08-09 17:30:48 They knew what they were doing... they've looted the trillion dollar sovereign fund and now control all the oil!
3478 2018-08-09 17:30:44 Everytime Russians and Syria start winning in Syria they pull this crap.  Interesting is the Declaration of War.  Bolton, CIA Mike. NATO fires a missle off near the Russian border. Russians filed a compliant to Chemical Oversight. Texas, etc want to sell the oil. We are in a Coup
3479 2018-08-09 17:30:44 Oil isn’t the only Scottish revenue that Westminster is cooking the books over
3480 2018-08-09 17:30:43 Very, very little, though it is helpful to fossil fuel interests and their bought messengers. Millions of Americans work directly and indirectly in oil, gas, coal. They have family members. Their employers spend millions to leverage politicians, think tanks, media and more.
3481 2018-08-09 17:30:43 It seems that you are getting wrong, the black thing you see is an Iron ore not oil. you rather talk to the local people so that they give you correct information. Thanks.
3482 2018-08-09 17:30:42 HAIR:

3483 2018-08-09 17:30:37 And my cars leaking oil. HELP.
3484 2018-08-09 17:30:37 I'm barbarian-phobic. When we don't need their oil anymore, they'll go back to tending camels in the desert. Good riddance.
3485 2018-08-09 17:30:35 Gave max a bath with coconut oil and I am starting to put a tablespoon or two of it in his food because his coat is suffering from all these allergies. It seems to be working so far so fingers crossed my boys fur will start grow back!
3486 2018-08-09 17:30:30 @JungleStrikeGuy I started using CBD oil for my after hockey recovery regiment. A week in and it's really noticeable how much better my arthritic shoulder feels in the morning. None of the OTC stuff I was taking even compares to how good I feel now the next day. #eyesWideOpenNow

3488 2018-08-09 17:30:23 Exactly. Canada is not business friendly. How about the emissions those tankers emit burning bunker crude transporting Saudi oil across the ocean here? Pretty sure that’s worse than transporting in a pipeline.
3489 2018-08-09 17:30:18 So true Tori. Everybody knows that REAL AMERICANS do lines of cocaine off 55 gallon oil drums.

3492 2018-08-09 17:29:51 Nope! Your countries economy is 80% oil and is a dictatorship and supports extremist sunni groups! THAT'S A FACT BACKED UP BY EVIDENCE!
3493 2018-08-09 17:29:42 Oil it up, lube that hole, shove it down right to your soul, lick it clean ,to put it back in, rinse, repeat & do it all again, that dirty deed, so unclean, cannot unsee the sin I've seen.

3496 2018-08-09 17:29:09 Except the chance of a major oil spill from a tanker is practically non existent. There have been oil tankers loading from TMX for decades without incident. Tankers bound for Washington straight navigate right through the Salish sea without incident. TMEP strengthens our rules.
3497 2018-08-09 17:29:09 History shows that humans switch energy sources every hundred years or so...we aren’t going back to coal the same way we aren’t still lighting our homes with whale oil.

3499 2018-08-09 17:29:05 You'll soon have enough. Have you heard of Akwa Ibom State oil money? I'm the dispenser
3500 2018-08-09 17:28:49 I still do not understand. As Trudeau has no problem stopping Alberta oil why does he not stop Saudi Oil if he is so concerned about Saudi's jailing of activists? Help me out here Liberal friends....
3501 2018-08-09 17:28:47 All Countries Should Stop Using Oil In The World Right Now Ok. ! ?
3502 2018-08-09 17:28:38 Ofc I have no idea where the damn charger for my oil pen is an smoked the last of my buds last night 
3503 2018-08-09 17:28:31 Learning more about myself...today I found out I violently dislike truffle oil.  How about you?
3504 2018-08-09 17:28:30 I should clarify as well. It's not a despairing remark towards him. He's be self spoken about the "production hell" he had been in. Prolly needs some time with a Mental health professional. Gotta get your brain's oil changed and tires rotated or sit is bound to fuck up.
3505 2018-08-09 17:28:28 @sorola I was watching the live podcast, you mentioned how the oil industry would be against Tesla and we’re killing the planet. while you’re technically not wrong about the planet, the real culprit is coal, and electric cars are BTU inefficient, and has a worse carbon footprint.
3506 2018-08-09 17:28:19 All Countries Should Stop Using Oil In The World Right Now. ! ?
3507 2018-08-09 17:28:13 Okay... It's the easiest...Dice the gourd into big pieces, heat mustard oil, add Hing, 1-2 badi elaichi, add finely chopped tomatoes, then add haldi, red chilli powder, a tsp of saunf powder, salt...cook until tomatoes get mushy, add the gourd pieces & cook until tender..
3508 2018-08-09 17:28:07 @realDonaldTrump why doesn't Canada buy US oil instead of Saudi oil it's the same price?
eastern refineries can't refine bitumen from western Canada but they can refine US oil easily
@JustinTrudeau @irvingoil
3509 2018-08-09 17:28:02 With the Shale Oil Drive, and as Refineries got more sophisticated to process heavy ends and get more light components, the need to buy ‘Light and Sweet Crude’ dropped
3510 2018-08-09 17:28:01 Environmentalists who can exercise logic are what Canada requires most. Yes pipelines are bad for the environment, yes oil production is bad for the environment, Steel mills and coal and oil powered electrical plants are bad for the environment. Close 'em all  #KeepCanadaWorking
3511 2018-08-09 17:27:58 With the oil supply pressure + trade ban from KSA, suffice to say it's time to buy oil stocks!
3512 2018-08-09 17:27:55 ในตอนนี้รู้จักกันแค่นี้พอ
3513 2018-08-09 17:27:55 For several reasons.  You can buy oil from other countries cheaper is one.  Another reason is we don't have enough refineries in parts of Canada.
3514 2018-08-09 17:27:49 A wee dab of lavender oil x
3515 2018-08-09 17:27:42 He had mostly finished up with his little projects, and was all the more covered in motor oil. 
It dotted his arms, exposed by his rolled up sleeves, stained his shirt in places, and a dab had somehow wound up smeared down along his cheekbone. +
3516 2018-08-09 17:27:35 If those idiots would just get with the renewable program instead of clinging to outdated oil, progress would be so much faster
3517 2018-08-09 17:27:24 Coconut oil brings out the flavor in fish curry. Do try, if you don't hate coconut oil. 
3518 2018-08-09 17:27:11 Change your products. Try a different brand. That's what I did recently and it made a huge difference.

Add scalp massages to your hair care routine. Using an oil (olive oil, coconut oil) #AfroHairCare
3519 2018-08-09 17:26:51 If Trudeau got serious and banned all Saudi Oil from Canada then he would get my support on this particular issue but so far he has done nothing that helps jailed Saudi activists and cost us billions in revenue while Saudi still cashes in selling us their dirty oil.
3520 2018-08-09 17:26:50 Neem oil has been the best fucking thing for my scalp and I wish it didn't smell like hot onions.
3521 2018-08-09 17:26:43 @realDonaldTrump For Cuba, Maduro and the International left it is very important to keep control over the UN-OHCHR the current UN-OHCHR had been under the control of Cuba-Venezuela under a scheme of bribes using Venezuelan oil money
3522 2018-08-09 17:26:28 It was just carrying that much oil smh
3523 2018-08-09 17:26:20 Does it taste the same as regular oil frying?
3524 2018-08-09 17:26:19 เพราะงั้นเป็นแค่นี้พอแล้ว
3525 2018-08-09 17:26:15 Oil change at jiffy lube via /r/car

My first time getting oil change from a spot. Like i usually let my brother do it but its time i stop relying on him lmao. Hahahah.. So noob.. I have no clue what to do at jiffy lube
3526 2018-08-09 17:26:10 Who is stupid?  We have no or limited infra structure in place to handle tar sand oil.  That is why we sell Dilbit to the US.  Meanwhile the refinery in Nova Scotia needs crude oil to operate.  Want to put that plant out of business, they need crude oil, not bitumen.
3527 2018-08-09 17:26:09 안돼요 이잉 기달려
3528 2018-08-09 17:26:04 The Canadian oilsands are 80% owned by Canadian companies. So not sure what industry you are referring to. And refining is an incredibly low margin activity. So your narrative does not apply at all too Canadian oil and gas.
3529 2018-08-09 17:25:58 I took some castor oil smh i shouldn’t have lol
3530 2018-08-09 17:25:58 Me and judgemental people are like water and oil.

3532 2018-08-09 17:25:54 Republicans are endangering our lives with their support of global warming naysayers.

3533 2018-08-09 17:25:53 Off topic Maybe. But is there something simmular like this movie for the oil industrie?
3534 2018-08-09 17:25:45 Aleina: *cooking eggs in olive oil*

3536 2018-08-09 17:25:39 Me too, tears are olive oil and balsamic vinegar
3537 2018-08-09 17:25:32 Haan...I was shocked! Haven't tried it yet... there's no place on the kitchen top to keep it and extract oil 
3538 2018-08-09 17:25:27 Saudi energy minister said they will continue selling oil to Canada.  So not buying Saudi oil will just mean Canada will have to buy from someone else.  The only action that can be taken is for companies to build more refineries first.
3539 2018-08-09 17:25:09 Brought my car in for an oil change and they say I need $1000 worth of work yall pray for me
3540 2018-08-09 17:25:02 Find new oil suppliers. Now!
3541 2018-08-09 17:24:54 ไม่เลย
3542 2018-08-09 17:24:53 I know, let’s build more pipelines and increase oil production. Right @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau. That’s a great decision, as we literally watch earth die, faster than anybody predicted. Never mind the financial costs of billions. Bad leadership.
3543 2018-08-09 17:24:51 So should I get an oil change or get some racist pancakes?
3544 2018-08-09 17:24:49 มองผิวเผินเหมือนจะอยู่ด้วยกันได้ แต่จริงๆแล้วไม่

3548 2018-08-09 17:24:26 Thank God for the dealership giving me my first oil change for free. That's $120 I was NOT expecting to save 
3549 2018-08-09 17:24:20 Must have found oil somewhere up there.....
3550 2018-08-09 17:24:14 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
3551 2018-08-09 17:23:49 Awesome article in @Forbes Tony!  In regards to section 461(I) what constitutes a trade or business?  If you are a LP in a partnership drilling oil drilling wells is your flow through of deductions limited?  Thanks!
3552 2018-08-09 17:23:38 You’re right. I should now factor in beard oil and pomades.

3556 2018-08-09 17:23:08 I don’t think China and Russia will comply with US sanctions, they’ll find a way to get Iranian oil/gas fro IR of Iran but in a cheaper  price.
3557 2018-08-09 17:22:58 Hahaha oil making machine ?
3558 2018-08-09 17:22:44 Biasanya ada tulisan, Cleansing Balm/Cleansing Oil. Yang Oil biasanya lebih murah dibanding sama balm. Merk2 yang punya cleansing oil ini ada Biore (98k), Innisfree, Nacific, Manyo, Etude << ini merk2 yg di bawah 250k harganya. Lainnya mungkin banyak cuma aku gatahu lg
3559 2018-08-09 17:22:28 Patriots: Probably Weaponizing IRS against Tea Party groups.
Coal: Halting clean(er) coal research and taxing coal energy plants out of existence WITH NO REPLACEMENT.
Oil: Maybe driving drilling rigs out of the gulf after one accident.

3561 2018-08-09 17:22:26 Human rights. What about canadian rights such as clean water for FN. @JustinTrudeau has had 3 years to stand up so KSA but refused and buys their oil and sells them arms
3562 2018-08-09 17:22:25 I don't understand how this is owning the libs. She took a picture with a straw because some people care about animals & the planet they live on? I'm going pour oil on myself & own the conservative.
3563 2018-08-09 17:22:17 Hey Schiffy....American people are not buying your snake oil.  No collusions no obstructuon, just sore loser dems calling out for conservatives election be nullified.  I disliked everything Obama..but I waited, & voted to make real change.  U cant nullufy the peoples choice.
3564 2018-08-09 17:22:05 To be honest, the only thing I found truly annoying about this heat, was having to remember to take my coconut oil out the fridge
3565 2018-08-09 17:21:52 A shampoo with tea trea oil as an ingredient does wonders for an itchy scalp. The best one I've used is from The Body shop. 

You must also make sure that you oil your scalp. If your scalp is dry it will certainly itch. I've been there.

3566 2018-08-09 17:21:47 I want to see Alberta oil flowing again however; are Canadians willing to pay significantly higher prices for “ethical” oil?
3567 2018-08-09 17:21:38 Babying the second car today. She got an oil change, air conditioner recharge, a tank of gas, and now she's getting two front tires to match the back I did a few weeks ago. Not feeling very good, but I only have two days off and so much to do. #PowerThroughIt

3571 2018-08-09 17:21:32 "Desperate for a better solution, CJ switched to cannabis oil in January  2017. He takes a dose every six hours. He hasn’t had an episode since. Doctors were so pleased with the results, they told him to keep playing football and there was no reason he couldn’t play in college."
3572 2018-08-09 17:21:30 @PRESIDENT_KENYATTA Invited to the white House? I guess Americans "WANT" a taste of our oil.
3573 2018-08-09 17:21:25 @EToddBreland I enjoyed your NPR piece on charter schools. When I was a court reporter, I reported public hearings of charters' proposals to Washington State & they ALL sounded like snake oil salespeople & they were all challenged by parents & nearly all approved. #Boo
3574 2018-08-09 17:21:02 strange that they'll still sell us oil

3583 2018-08-09 17:20:16 Bruh, the USS Arizona (Pearl Harbor) is STILL leaking oil into the ocean? Clean that shit up man @USNavy
3584 2018-08-09 17:20:14 If the Canadian government really supported human rights than why are we buying oil from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Algeria, Angola, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast? All of which have questionable human rights records.
3585 2018-08-09 17:20:13 I just wanna go surfing and rub tanning oil on some cheeks
3586 2018-08-09 17:20:12 $HIPH LALPINA Hydro CBD allows for greater bio availability which leads to a greater & quicker absorption rate compared to regular CBD oil or CBD water.
3587 2018-08-09 17:20:01 What's that metallic rainbow effect that seems to be increasingly popular on pins, flasks and well everything actually called? You know, that thing that looks like oil on a puddle? Like, does it have a word?
3588 2018-08-09 17:20:00 Let's cut out Corporate subsidies like the one Big Oil has, silly me, the GOP would never do that.
3589 2018-08-09 17:19:59 attempted to cook breakfast, for the most part i did well then oil wanted to come at me so i told my mom to take over 
3590 2018-08-09 17:19:48 There’s this weird hippy lady that I work with sometimes who always try’s to get people to smell her home made mint oil and kombucha shit.
3591 2018-08-09 17:19:44 Unleaded is higher in demand. But a barrel of oil makes about 20 gallons of gasoline and 11 gallons of fuel oil distillate, which is mostly diesel for vehicles, but is used for other things as well
3592 2018-08-09 17:19:42 America discovered space oil now we are researching space freedom!
3593 2018-08-09 17:19:40 We're waiting for all the Boomers and old oil-white-guys to die off so reasonable dialogue can be had about doing things without cars.
That's my guess anyway, because I can't think of any other reason why Houston doesn't have one of the most evolved rail systems in the US...
3594 2018-08-09 17:19:39 She has been visiting the Oil Technology Centre. The poor staff there must be sick of politicians from all parties, there constantly seems to be one visiting them.
3595 2018-08-09 17:19:37 Just got my oil change and turns out I need two front tires and an alignment 
3596 2018-08-09 17:19:24 Toyota tomorrow  gotta get my radio fixed and an oil change . I need my car detailed too .

3598 2018-08-09 17:19:19 What those guys are doing well is scare mongering and thus taking clients from traditional agencies with snake oil promises about future proofing.
3599 2018-08-09 17:19:18 Qué buenas frases hacía este señor, pero no creo que fueran para tomarse literalmente. Tanto Wilde como NIeztche como Freud sabían que uno es el peor juez y enemigo de sí mismo, por eso todos estaban contra la conciencia, Dios judeo-cristiano, el superego...

3602 2018-08-09 17:18:55 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
3603 2018-08-09 17:18:54 Garden Herb is slowly coming for the Rosemary Olive Oil CROWN
3604 2018-08-09 17:18:48 Vexed rn I spilled my coconut oil  don’t talk to me.
3605 2018-08-09 17:18:41 There is no cross-road here, you have if figured out. Hence, all you have to do is keep being yourself and never expecting too much from them all. Dont let it get to you.... If dem break your heart, na oil spillage

3608 2018-08-09 17:18:13 They still put some weird preservatives in shit like this. I just rice my own fresh cauliflower and pan fry it with olive oil until its crispy.
3609 2018-08-09 17:18:11 recharge! I use lavander oil, you can get a steamer or just put them on your temples! Anything to calm the nerves! Finding pressure points on your hands help too!
3610 2018-08-09 17:18:06 Fun fact: Mayo is part vinegar and part seed-oil. Current example containing rapeseed. Which sounds disgusting in English by the way, but is the oil from turnip seeds.
3611 2018-08-09 17:18:06 India Nayara Energy, part-owned by Rosneft's, will shut  400,000 bpd Vadinar refinery for 1 mth maintenance from mid-Nov. Nayara is key Indian client for Iran oil & planned shutdown will coincide with start of US #Iransanctions on oil...RTRS #OOTT

Sorry Guys

3616 2018-08-09 17:17:34 Had a suitcase version of this to work in Alberta's oil patch.
3617 2018-08-09 17:17:30 Papusha Rocket ICO - is the latest technology to destroy oil refineries residues around the world. Instead of destroying flora and fauna, refineries get gasoline and diesel fuel for selling. #Papusha #Token #ETH
3618 2018-08-09 17:17:24 Chef Louis cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Silly Putty.
3619 2018-08-09 17:17:15 Some essential oil (lavender, etc...) on a cotton pad under the seat works great.
3620 2018-08-09 17:17:14 You should hear some of the executives at these oil companies down here in Texas talk. Every last one of them has an engineering degree to go with their off-kilter lexicon. We still follow them . . .
3621 2018-08-09 17:17:01 Canada is a G7 country with a tiny population compared to others. We are always one of the best countries to live in by any measure. Our quality of life, freedoms and opportunities are tops. What do you have? Oil.  So do we. Go away.
3622 2018-08-09 17:17:01 1. The alternator in my #Mini needs replaced. B/C I’m giving the car to my daughter I decided to replace a few other mechanical parts. Purchased the following: Turbo, Manifold, Oil feed, Oil return, Water Pump & Pulley, Tensioner, Belt pulley, 10 cooling system hoses, Thermostat
3623 2018-08-09 17:17:01 We had better get the infra structure in place first before we go spouting off more insults.  Nova Scotia needs crude oil to process and that comes from SA.  They cannot process bitumen/Dilbit but US can and sell back to us as refined product.
3624 2018-08-09 17:16:57 you know how to change oil and change tires 
3625 2018-08-09 17:16:54 Note to self: Never ever again, put peppermint oil on your cigarette.
3626 2018-08-09 17:16:51 My one packed up at 166000oil changed every 5000 miles
3627 2018-08-09 17:16:49 But we still buy their oil
3628 2018-08-09 17:16:42 I really like it for preparing single servings of crispy bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (egg wash + seasoned flour, no extra oil). Air fried brussels sprouts are better than oven roasted, but not as good as pan fried (pan fried drinks up the kitchen more tho).
3629 2018-08-09 17:16:41 Silicon Valley millionaires would love to be the authoritarians that rule over communism in this country. They are Traders scum and need to be regulated like the oil companies. Social media has become a monopoly regulating conservative common sense thought.

3631 2018-08-09 17:16:33 May is going in with Trump. Merkle has be undermined. Italy is a wreck. France — crickets. Japan is dependant on Saudi oil. The G7 has never been in such disarray and so illiberal.
3632 2018-08-09 17:16:32 im so hungry & they taking forever with my oil change 
3633 2018-08-09 17:16:29 Noooo!  not cool! My mum used to put warm olive oil in my ear when I had problems! Hope it clears up really fast buddy. Sounds no fun :(
3634 2018-08-09 17:16:24 Omo.. dem must pay that guy millions oh... based on its his fathers land... that’s like discovering oil in your own Land.
3635 2018-08-09 17:16:21 He should be honored. But he didn't sacrifice for our country. He sacrificed for big oil and big pharma.
3636 2018-08-09 17:16:17 I’m living the lap of luxury, breaking off chunks of fresh feta cheese from a good sized block we bought from the outdoor food market for €2 along with fresh pita bread and real Greek olive oil I never want to go back to the states
3637 2018-08-09 17:15:39 Oil & Gas Upstream is a highly risky business meant for the big boys only. But if you stop exploring, you are finished.
3638 2018-08-09 17:15:35 あの時からずっとですよ…転々と病院は行ってるけど未だに…
3639 2018-08-09 17:15:28 I definitely care!  I just thought it’s probably more complicated than I know.  The oil industry is heavily subsidized and controls are in place the keep prices lower.  Production here and abroad affect prices.
3640 2018-08-09 17:15:27 Oil is not a moisturizer 
3641 2018-08-09 17:15:18 I have low porosity hair and I'm using coconut&hairfood, moisturizer,  blackseed hair oil, and castor oil but my scalp is still very dry, so are there any advices on how to moisturize my hair
3642 2018-08-09 17:15:17 I use this oil on my weave should I use it to base my lines then as well?
3643 2018-08-09 17:15:13 Coconut oil is the best thing I have ever put on my skin
3644 2018-08-09 17:14:56 EXACTLY and the oil/timber/fishery booms? My god. Google fuckin exists ksjfaljfak
3645 2018-08-09 17:14:51 Did you drive your car to this location to take this picture? Do you use heating or electricity in your house? You use so many things every day that use oil, gas and coal. Let the market decide when to switch to wind and solar is sustainable for the people that use the products!
3646 2018-08-09 17:14:48 ใจมึงบอกว่าไม่ใช่ตั้งแต่วันที่มึงเดินออกมา จนถึงตอนนี้ก็ยังคิดอย่างนั้น ไม่เคยคิดจะเดินกลับไป
3647 2018-08-09 17:14:47 What many forget or don't realize it wasn't mostly about players-The Oil received about $178 million in cash as well.
3648 2018-08-09 17:14:46 The @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau should learn from this and  look into replacing Saudi oil purchases to make #Canada energy independent with renewable energy sources #SolarEnergy #windenergy #hydropower #geothermal energy, #biomass
3649 2018-08-09 17:14:41 Put coconut oil in it

3651 2018-08-09 17:14:16 gotta confess lads, i thought clay masks were made of false promises and snake oil (and dirt) but i just used one and i have ascended to become a god among men
3652 2018-08-09 17:14:15 Bio oil...
3653 2018-08-09 17:14:15 You are Big Oil. Everything you say is suspect. You constantly put CEO bonuses over the welfare of people & planet.
3654 2018-08-09 17:14:09 So toh hain....you won't believe, looking at my madness to have eth homemade, someone has gifted me an oil making machine!! 
3655 2018-08-09 17:14:02 Conservatives 2015: Trudeau is a failure because TransMountain cancelled the Energy East pipeline. We must stop getting our oil from evil Saudi Arabia
Conservatives 2018: Trudeau must apologize for hurting the feelings of the Saudi Princes.

3657 2018-08-09 17:13:45 Was asked about $CVSII from @DojiFranco90 on the weekend. Said I can easily see it ripping to $10, but I hate playing OTCs (my brokerage makes me call them)... They still seem cheap here... First mover in CBD oil means something.
3658 2018-08-09 17:13:37 Why are they behaving like a legit govt? Imposing their rule on #Syrian land people & oil? The tide is turning & #SAA will take back what is #Syrian territory as I am reliable informed the #US will pull out soon no more air suport & locals have enough of #Kurdish militias
3659 2018-08-09 17:13:31 Kick back, fix her a glass of wine, get a tongue vibrator, rub her down in oil. Then vibrate+glide it across her body & Suck her toes.  “She has a long week ahead” #ThankMeLater.

3666 2018-08-09 17:12:43 I think cost of oil import is the gvt other argument.Why not tax incentivize efficient cars(hybrid,electric),cars built locallyban old cars(15-20yr)require yearly registration n inspection(emission etc)feesadd road fund tax on fuel, tolls,vehicle sales etcbld toll roads
3667 2018-08-09 17:12:38 안보는데 어케 보내요
3668 2018-08-09 17:12:37 good to know! we were planning to wage all kinds of herbal warfare on them, peppermint oil, cayenne, all the good stinky stuff
3669 2018-08-09 17:12:26 Shake it like oil of vitriol, the king of chemicals
3670 2018-08-09 17:12:24 Nope roasted on a grill with a light amount of extra virgin olive oil and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.
3671 2018-08-09 17:12:15 I had friends who did it. Went to the oil fires. suffered a lot.  India does have its cultural problems. The spend thousands on weddings, men need a dowry to get married. That kind of rubbish persists.
3672 2018-08-09 17:12:14 No, they r doing it for the interest payments and to make sure Pakistan doesn't buy oil from its competitors, like Iran, for example.
3673 2018-08-09 17:12:06 Is there a lecture on selling us oil? There cutting us off ... maybe @JustinTrudeau should do his job and cut them off. Make Canada Great Again
3674 2018-08-09 17:12:03 Take air filter out. See if it starts. If it does than replace. Check oil. Sometimes won’t start or shut down if too little or too much.
3675 2018-08-09 17:12:01 Nothing, as long as we have a plan in place to deal with the certain and negative reaction of the government whose citizens we are attempting to turn against them. Btw, part of that plan should be to stop importing Saudi oil, and therefore funding the regime.
3676 2018-08-09 17:11:56 All about oil! We say nothing, do nothing. Big oil Big money, at the expenses of children, women, and the poor
3677 2018-08-09 17:11:56 Do you know if any reliable resources that have a list of some trusted brands of olive oil?
3678 2018-08-09 17:11:48 Nah #CO2ClimateChange's"The Science"is so"settled"that fabricating data  to"prove"it is but a Labor of Love to help correct the False Consciousness of Big Oil's enslaved Workers:as Goebbels himself put it,~"The ppl must be made to see that the Right Thing is the Right Thing!"
3679 2018-08-09 17:11:37 #Democrats soundly rejected #socialist candidates in congressional races. Will the young socialists now support whomever the (D) party candidates are or will this be oil on the waters of the #BlueWave ? #PoliticsToday
3680 2018-08-09 17:11:35 Because oil and coal are up. Iron ores require a lot of energy to transform to steel.
3681 2018-08-09 17:11:29 Bahar ka oil theek nahin rehta hain...100 bimariyon ka karan hain woh
3682 2018-08-09 17:11:25 If so, you better pray its not some of those owners. Just remember Randy Lerner owned Villa and the Browns. We have an equal amount of morons in the states. You're better off with Oil money.
3683 2018-08-09 17:11:21 Oil producing you say. Did you know that North Sea oil is the most expensive to extract in the world? It just isn't very profitable. Norway's oil production costs are lower than ours and they produce twice as much as us.
3684 2018-08-09 17:11:18 #EUR 1.15 getting very juicy.... once this breaks, watch for #gold #oil and #USA Equities to move as well.
3685 2018-08-09 17:11:17 I can’t tell people I’m an engineer coz they think I get called when their heating breaks. I tell them that I design oil and gas plants, then they go silent. 
3686 2018-08-09 17:11:05 We let corporations extract natural resources (oil specifically) they pay royalties on the top corporations can claim business expenses on their tax forms. Did anyone do the exact math how much royalties they paid and how much tax breaks they got? In the end does it benefit us?
3687 2018-08-09 17:11:04 How much fish oil do take and what do you recommend for energy supplements?
3688 2018-08-09 17:11:00 Canada has larger oil reserves than Saudi land.
3689 2018-08-09 17:10:55 I have gotten Africa in the army, offshore oil, construction in Kuwait. Not a missionary yet though. The iTunes requests make it SO obvious.
3690 2018-08-09 17:10:43 the lust oil from @jadefoxco is next on my list 
3691 2018-08-09 17:10:39 This SLIMY LIL' SAWED TURD NEEDS SENT BACK HOME TO HIS "OIL" TYCOON DADA RON PAUL WHERE THE LIL' AZZHOLE BELONGS !! PHUK HIM AND HIS TREASONOUS LARDAZZ DON-DA-PHUK'N  CON DRUMPF ! TWO PRICKS "STEAL" = 2 PRICKS AND NOTHIN' MORE !!
3692 2018-08-09 17:10:32 My roommate and I got an air fryer, and it roasts the chick peas faster, more evenly, and with less oil than in the oven. (I make them ~3x a week when it's not hot as hell outside.)
3693 2018-08-09 17:10:26 Learned not to put water on burning fry oil today
3694 2018-08-09 17:10:23 next up: baby oil on my hair legs

3696 2018-08-09 17:10:06 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
3697 2018-08-09 17:10:04 Ha! Ha! This is ridiculous. You can't reason with the unreasonable... Well, good luck with your country. It's all going to crumble like a house of cards when the world shifts from oil to electricity. So...
3698 2018-08-09 17:10:00 Canada has has huge amounts of oil reserves, the third largest in the world. 
I would be happy to see all Canadians using oil produced in Canada.
We also export our oil as we export automobiles and airplanes.

3699 2018-08-09 17:09:50 We need crude oil not bitumen which we cannot process here, it goes to US who refines it and sells it back to us.  You want to put the refinery in Nova Scotia out of business now?  Get the refineries built and the pipeline before you spout off about using Canadian oil.
3700 2018-08-09 17:09:43 Okay so I'm late to the party but I put coconut oil in my hair last night and now I'm wondering why I didn't jump on the bandwagon a long time ago
3701 2018-08-09 17:09:37 Strange. I was told olive oil lasts about 2 years, so harvest dates are important information.
3702 2018-08-09 17:09:36 India's  Nayara Energy, part-owned by Rosneft's, will shut its 400,000 bpd Vadinar refinery for 1 mth maintenance from mid-Nov. .Nayara is the key Indian oil client of Iran & the planned shutdown will coincide with the start of U.S. sanctions targeting Tehran's oil sector.-- RTRS

3709 2018-08-09 17:08:44 in terms of economic benefit to Canada: showing that SA is unpredictable and undependable makes Canadian oil more valuable.  It's a smart move.
3710 2018-08-09 17:08:40 I have consumed so much fucking olive oil in the past 24 hours
3711 2018-08-09 17:08:39 Made a 200% trade on Nadex Binaries today with Oil so that was cool
3712 2018-08-09 17:08:23 Yea really , if PMJT had any real backbone he would shut that off too, but he can’t Quebec and the Irvings need the oil . Only western Canadians lose out because SA quit buying our grain
3713 2018-08-09 17:08:07 The US could go further. Stop selling all weapons to Saudi Arabia. Stop buying their oil.

And Iran did not threaten Canada with 9/11.
3714 2018-08-09 17:07:57 OK I blew the power steering line and now my brakes are covered in oil that's why the brake light came on neat.  Not the end of the world

3716 2018-08-09 17:07:52 Document in question isn't what he's claiming it is, it's a hmrc consultation document to aid devolved assemblies in queries about goods trade within the UK. It has no bearing on tax revenue, no connection to where oil revenue is recorded as from, & no relevance to "indyref1".
3717 2018-08-09 17:07:35 my first attempt was with an oil based m&g marker which... failed, lmao

Corey: Yeah, the greatest classification in the land is not that there are ETs. It's how they got here.
3720 2018-08-09 17:07:18 Thursday ritual: oil down 
3721 2018-08-09 17:07:13 Some people believe oil is incondicional to us and that it will be with us forever and ever, instead of burn less oil and make cars more efficient because we already know oil will dry sooner or later, some people wants to increase output and uses 
3722 2018-08-09 17:07:03 have you seen what is left behind when they mine ingredients for lithium batteries? can you compare it to what is left after oil rig has left? do you care about that? how do you get electricity for your electric cars? not wind mills or solar panels that's for sure
3723 2018-08-09 17:07:01 for this I used a fine point sharpie marker, which is water based instead of oil based. they're not easy to use bc the pen glides on the plastic while your hand tends to stick to it, but it is fun
3724 2018-08-09 17:06:59 Experience with Texas so far: lotta steer/horses, lotta trucks, armadillo/coyote roadkill, Texas flags, those little oil pumps you see in movies
3725 2018-08-09 17:06:54 Purp oil on deck 50 a line
3726 2018-08-09 17:06:51 Threw some haloumi and French bread on the bbq, topped off with a slice of tomato once grilled. Tossed together some greens with mushrooms, parm, olive oil, fresh lemon juice and seasoning. Added some breadsticks and Camembert for good measure. Vacation lunch is the best lunch.

3730 2018-08-09 17:06:36 My boss ordered hemp oil on amazon and was dripping it into his mouth and offered me some and said “Kayla you want some weed” 
3731 2018-08-09 17:06:33 Naa. They should let the oil from the anointing make them speak good English & maybe small branding.
3732 2018-08-09 17:06:24 To me Space Force is like when you have 10 loads of laundry to do & dishes to wash & floors to sweep and vacuum & groceries to buy & kids to feed & beds to change & lawns to mow & your car needs an oil change, but your partner is like "I think I'm gonna build us a rocketship."
3733 2018-08-09 17:06:16 Gonna take my car to Toyota for an oil change & test drive some SUVs  I’m ready for a mom car!
3734 2018-08-09 17:06:11 Hmmmm. Coconut oil darkened her one time.
3735 2018-08-09 17:05:55 Is anyone else tired of being America's poor second cousins? Our paper mills are being closed almost daily while we purchase paper from the U.S. . We buy oil from the Saudis and send ours to the U.S. ? #KeepCanadaWorking
3736 2018-08-09 17:05:48 My goodness man. Just put your body in rice and coconut oil at this point 
3737 2018-08-09 17:05:42 Don't forget to visit the Llanfair & Welshpool Railway on the way back to the Midlands. You can ride on the open verandah carriages and smell the steam & hot oil. Fantastic.
3738 2018-08-09 17:05:31 I always wonder what it smells like under there?
3739 2018-08-09 17:05:27 The guy at the oil change place was a cowboys fan and we had a full on convo on the upcoming szn and my guy gave me a whole discount gassed?? I think tf yes
3740 2018-08-09 17:05:21 @SeloSlav Were you at Fancy Food Show in NYC in June? Shipping only to EU or to any NYC locations? Have enjoyed Croatian olive oil in past.
3741 2018-08-09 17:05:20 A bankrupt country causes inflation so rampant they can't pay the bills...example ...Venezuela. And they are oil rich!
3742 2018-08-09 17:05:15 As soon as the media blitz starts, Snake oil salesman Sharpton will fly in to.......talk....and....voice his opinion.......and......what exactly does that clown do????
3743 2018-08-09 17:05:15 i meant its becoz of Sanctions by trump ! hope the oil rich country find buyers of its oil amid sanctions !
3744 2018-08-09 17:05:12 By that standard, filtered through @OddStats ulterior motive machine, their ulterior ulterior motive could be simply to send a relatively inexpensive message that they believe oil will be rising, despite knowing it won't.
3745 2018-08-09 17:05:06 If you run a school, publishing company, book shop, hotel, restaurant/bar, sell anointing oil, soap, handkerchief, sticker, etc, then you must PAY TAX as a Church.
3746 2018-08-09 17:05:03 Olive oil and cracked black pepper
3747 2018-08-09 17:04:56 I recommend we also check your lug nuts and drain your oil pan.
3748 2018-08-09 17:04:51 Kid requested one of my easiest and healthiest dishes

ROASTED CHICKPEAS

Generously slick cookie sheets w/olive oil

Mix in salt, cumin

Dump cooked chickpeas on top of oil in single layer. Mix to coat. 

Bake, shaking occasionally, at 300 til crispy.
3749 2018-08-09 17:04:49 Cut off ties with Iran & do not import oil from U.A.E as Hascol is doing so.
Etc etc.
3750 2018-08-09 17:04:44 I wanna learn how to change oil 
3751 2018-08-09 17:04:43 @jockowillink 
How much fish oil do you take?
And what do you recommend for energy supplements for Chad, my husband?
3752 2018-08-09 17:04:41 As little as I use them for other remedies, essential oils. A bit of peppermint under the nose gets me through tough smells. Also oil diffusers work really well for wide area smell fixes. I’ve got one in my kitchen and it spreads through the entire floor of the house.
3753 2018-08-09 17:04:33 Need to buy some black seed oil
3754 2018-08-09 17:04:28 Sad that Saudi Arabia feels it is ok to still send us oil, but cancel everything else (that is actually positive) that makes Canada money or is enriching to its citizens. Good for Trudeau to stand up to the medieval regime and take the higher moral ground. #saudicanada
3755 2018-08-09 17:04:27 WTI oil at $67.03/barrel, near unchanged as it tries to stabilize after the recent decline ... $66 looks like support.
3756 2018-08-09 17:04:20 残念,,Ծ‸Ծ,,
またよろしくです～！
3757 2018-08-09 17:04:17 Technical is easy: them refineries don't eat dilbit. NFLD oil is a new thing. So is AB bitumen.
Political: that's a headscratcher.
3758 2018-08-09 17:04:15 what rise the prices are the problems that hurt oil supplies all over the world, and always the Westerns behind every problem.

Look at Libya, they can't produce oil like they was before, because the NATO interfere and dropped the government, this drop created a mess over there.
3759 2018-08-09 17:04:15 Yes, I think they're making concrete off those rocks or something. Kudala the mountain was believed to have oil deposits.
3760 2018-08-09 17:04:06 The way the Saudis are reacting is a bit bonkers. What happens to Eastern Canada if they cut oil shipments altogether? What's the backup plan?
3761 2018-08-09 17:04:04 Nooo  Is there anyway you can get your hands on some peppermint essential oil?? Smelling that sometimes helps relieve mine a little bit so I can get through the day.
3762 2018-08-09 17:03:57 Actually most of the air pollution is caused by manufacturing and oil refineries. People who smoke count for extremely small percentage of pollution.
3763 2018-08-09 17:03:56 Canada is a drop in the bucket.  Rewarding is better. A tax is a grab at cash. If tax, why not BC exported coal. Coal 13x worse than oil.
3764 2018-08-09 17:03:46 Release then Secret Space Program (SSP) stuff don and you'll be a legend. Get those Free Energy Patents released and the planet can have peace instead of fighting over Oil. #QAnon.

3766 2018-08-09 17:03:34 My point is that if our Trudeau Gov is or was serious in their tweet around the Bedawi family,now with the Saudi now saying they will keep selling Canada oil, would be an excellent time to take a stand and say, " Thanks but no thanks until you release Raif Badawi and his sister"
3767 2018-08-09 17:03:25 when girls do they makeup why they put that oil shit on they lips ? like what that posed to do ? 
3768 2018-08-09 17:03:23 One thing I will say is that it’s a very sticky mixture, so I spray my hands with Pam or some kind of oil before rolling the cookies, and sometimes I add more pecans if I feel like it.
3769 2018-08-09 17:03:20 Ok but look politically speaking the west starts condemning SA while USA is increasing oil supply makes sense. Sanctions on Saudi Arabia keeps supply low and prices high everyone wins. Except Saudi Arabia which we will claim we are sanctioning them because of human rights. Lol

3775 2018-08-09 17:02:35 Your notion is wrong, because PDP had the chance to prove to Nigerians for 16 years that they are credible enough to put Nigerians interest first. PDP failed Nigerians, and there is no third chance for PDP anymore. They looted billions of dollars of oil funds. PDP stole from us.

3780 2018-08-09 17:02:05 I noticed a somewhat curious thing, crude oil is not included in the tariff increase. In 2017, China did import more than USD 3 billion in crude oil from USA. #China

3787 2018-08-09 17:01:17 The United States exports oil.
3788 2018-08-09 17:01:15 I don't think you ever stop being a "politician" so to answer your 1st question I would say yes.  Your second point I completely agree. The answer to the second question: IDK that's very concerning and I feel terrible for all the lives lost over "WMDs" A.K.A.  OIL!!!!
3789 2018-08-09 17:01:08 When we find realistic alternatives to oil, I will be first to march against oil companies but right now we need oil to keep our homes warm in winter, it defies logic that we would haul oil in barges from Saudi Arabia when we have an abundance of oil right here #KeepCanadaWorking
3790 2018-08-09 17:01:03 Of course because when they will run out of oil you know what else they can sell? You know anyone who need sand?  they will be fucked... they will become history so they try to get every penny they can for now...

But the way it should be done is by: building state of the art schools and hospitals; paying teachers, nurses, doctors and law enforcement officers well; free University; building homes for

3798 2018-08-09 17:00:30 It's a concerted effort by the power that be whose interest is threatened because unlike olive oil, palm oil's price can be very competitive against soy, cottonseed & corn.

3820 2018-08-09 16:59:10 So write-ups in various newspapers indicating Canada would not miss Saudi oil and all of a sudden they get all magnanimous and throw a crumb.  Duplicity and disingenuousness.
3821 2018-08-09 16:59:04 Its all about greed. Nigerians knew the right thing to do. But PDP is a party that shares money around to make you look the other way. That is how they succeeded to destroy Nigeria for 16 years. They loot and share billions of dollars, oil funds disappear with no accountability

3823 2018-08-09 16:59:03 Correct Michelle, but Trump ''is'' going to push for a boycott on Iranian oil exports, so with Saudi cutting Canada off, and if Trudeau,( whose brother Al, btw, produces propaganda for Iran) gets force into the boycott...?  We wouldn't be held hostage if we were self-sufficient.
3824 2018-08-09 16:59:03 Con "asumirán" quieres decir supondrán?
3825 2018-08-09 16:59:00 I am bringing several vials of oil to the Evolving Conference. We can join together against the dark spirit of patriarchy.
3826 2018-08-09 16:58:57 The engine oil's secondary function is to get heat out of the engine; make sure that you always use the right engine oil - Kofi Boakye #TotalAutoShow
3827 2018-08-09 16:58:56 looks like oil products are still on though
3828 2018-08-09 16:58:43 @Shell Your oil pricing is the same as pulling off the M1 into one of your garages with a perishing thirst to be met with the only drink available being a £10 2 litre bottle of special shell coke! Ridiculous....
3829 2018-08-09 16:58:33 i need to start putting more effort into my appearance/skin care. i’m sick of looking like an oil truck ran me over and then backed over me a couple times
3830 2018-08-09 16:58:27 "Established in 2003, nice...when were Arsenal and Spurs created?"

Not even our oil money could create a wall long enough
3831 2018-08-09 16:58:20 저 싫어하시는 거 아니었어요 ㅠㅠ? 제가 멘션으로 귀찮게 한 거 같아서
3832 2018-08-09 16:58:20 It's not just about the oil.
Scotland has a plethora of natural resources, things to sell AND  talent.
Our future is crackin!
3833 2018-08-09 16:58:19 Are Canadians willing to pay more for “ethical” Canadian oil vs Saudi oil? Just curious where ppl stand on this.
3834 2018-08-09 16:58:18 Not really, this is just an oil payment facility, which will be used to finance Pakistan's fuel purchases from Saudi Arabia. Pakistan will have to raise money from a variety of sources, as the IMF funding in itself is not enough to bridge the funding gap
3835 2018-08-09 16:58:16 Bill Kristol is a snake oil salesman. People should throw baracks at him to see how he's still a screecher of the swamp.
3836 2018-08-09 16:58:14 Our buttery spreads are vegetarian friendly, but not vegan certified. We do have a stick with sunflower oil! It's our new buttery sticks! Enjoy!
3837 2018-08-09 16:58:05 Still in shock after watching a man cover himself in olive oil and a girl violently suck off 6 bananas to then regurgitate them and spit them at the audience ... all to the song “satisfaction” .. traumatised #freefringe #IntoTheUnknown
3838 2018-08-09 16:58:03 The empire.. I mean Republicans don't care about ewoks they will just invade the Homeland to take all the oil
3839 2018-08-09 16:57:55 Canadas energy security has always been at risk , my guess , quebec can start buying western oil or freeze in the dark. Better get used to that bike too
3840 2018-08-09 16:57:54 You're welcome! Lorenzo the Ork helped a lot of down-and-out street scum from his meager soup kitchen, that's for sure. (Character idea was from watching part of "Lorenzo's Oil" during an influenza week. #FeverDreams)
3841 2018-08-09 16:57:52 When it’s fresh out the popper sometimes it is cuz of the oil!!
3842 2018-08-09 16:57:52 In fact, we don’t need their oil.  We have plenty in Canada. It’s just a political decision to buy oil from them
3843 2018-08-09 16:57:50 Venezuela has one of the highest oil reserves in the world, they are squeezed out of the global market by illegal sanctions imposed by imperialist. So does Iran! So yea the model is correct but you could never see the results due to sanctions ...
3844 2018-08-09 16:57:46 Hyperbole to describe this as an attack or coordinated. Jones is a despicable person who does this for money. He is a snake oil salesman who regularly incite gullible people to violence, civil unrest, conspiracy theories and bad healthcare decisions. He does not deserve a patform
3845 2018-08-09 16:57:45 On top of that I use heating pads, hot showers, teas and I put lavender oil on my back ,shin and stomach!
3846 2018-08-09 16:57:42 I hope you will be able to live for long term without Saudi oil 
3847 2018-08-09 16:57:41 BTW we probably have more oil long term then you do

Why do you think MBS is making all the changes?

He wants to do business with the world

He needs to, your oil is drying up

Once you adjust to the MBS rules, hopefully we can be friends in the future and hang out some time
3848 2018-08-09 16:57:38 O my dear heavenly father ,
Jewish people are searching for holy things.Iam praying for Arons  anointed oil bottle , red heifer ,high priests lineage of levi tribe  and ashes preserved bowl of Khalal .pl send your cherubs to guide them n find the things .
3849 2018-08-09 16:57:37 I think you were right about Gadaffi a lot was  CIA  meddling  there appeared to be a general deliberate attempt to destabilise at the time,  personally I remember I was of the view there was a desire to control the oil . Bush is alleged to have indicated his desire for this.
3850 2018-08-09 16:57:31 ยังไม่แน่ใจทั้ง2เรื่องอ่ะมึง แต่ก็ปากต่อปากอ่ะ ไม่มีหลักฐานอะไร
3851 2018-08-09 16:57:30 When the fried bread oil be hot asff 
3852 2018-08-09 16:57:27 Internet went funny right as I made the space oil joke I think they're onto me.
3853 2018-08-09 16:57:25 The same is true for cars. It was a stupid thing to sell an American car that uses a lot of gasoline to Japan without oil fields long ago. Do you think that American cars can be sold to energy saving Japan?
3854 2018-08-09 16:57:21 Miracle Whip has less oil than Mayo so can't call itself mayo.  Also, MW has a sweet, spicy flavor.  I liked MW when I was young.  Now my taste buds don't care for the sweet, spicy flavor and it tastes like there's a lot of vinegar. It's OK to be me.  
3855 2018-08-09 16:57:11 아뇨 저 진짜 무서워서 그래요 ㅠㅠㅠ 힝... 힝...
3856 2018-08-09 16:57:06 When making the oil for the cannabutter I use low heat to conserve as much terpenes possible. With all due respect
3857 2018-08-09 16:56:58 That’s a moot point a doctor is getting paid to perform medical acts a engineer is paid to design buildings gas and oil etc. They are providing a service. Where in the Bible does it say you have to pay for your salvation?

3859 2018-08-09 16:56:56 We don’t need their oil. @JustinTrudeau stop the oil imports from Saudi Arabia  immediately. There are lots of other suppliers or just give us the energy east pipeline making Saudi oil unnecessary.
3860 2018-08-09 16:56:52 Krill oil, Vitamin D, Lithium, Athletic Greens. Nope.
3861 2018-08-09 16:56:44 The same is true for cars. It was a stupid thing to sell an American car that uses a lot of gasoline to Japan without oil fields long ago. Do you think that American cars can be sold to energy saving Japan?
3862 2018-08-09 16:56:39 USD used to buy oil. Oil selling nation has huge surplus of USD. After buying what it needs, huge surplus USD invested into assets like US treasuries (USD is world reserve currency). Countries offering alt. to USD usually end up on an 'axis of evil' type list & need 'liberating'.
3863 2018-08-09 16:56:34 We are so screwed up as a country that we export our oil on the west coast and import it on the east coast. We pump our oil south to be refined and sold back to us as gasoline. Energy east you idiots!
3864 2018-08-09 16:56:29 Saraki, melaye and the rest defected to PDP for personal interest. To have the chance to loot Nigerians treasury. They think they can remove PMB from power so they can loot and embezzle oil funds, just like PDP looted $800 billion of oil funds in 16 years without accountability
3865 2018-08-09 16:56:27 While these workers chilling somebody better be back there putting some oil in my shit
3866 2018-08-09 16:56:27 I can’t wait for peak oil, the earth is hanging by a thread. Which will come first, peak oil or climate extinction?
3867 2018-08-09 16:56:22 i have to get an oil change ASAP
3868 2018-08-09 16:56:22 Suncor numbers show a ten to one return on their investments. So if it MUST be oil then invest the money here and reap the rewards here. And we won’t need to put more tankers in my coastal economy.
3869 2018-08-09 16:56:17 I mean we've been helping Israel for decades and going to war for oil since the first Bush. Not to mention the military industrial complex profits off of the manufacturing and distribution of weapons, to our soldiers or other nations.
3870 2018-08-09 16:56:15 Yes haven't you seen the looting and killing? Ogadenians are now trying to return the loot to the people. Don't fear the truth. If you think oil it is not even started.

3872 2018-08-09 16:55:59 i’m getting my oil changed at subaru and the waiting rooms tv is off, but i don’t wanna be that person and turn it on
3873 2018-08-09 16:55:59 You should be embarrassed of yourself praising crappy starbucks espresso.....  Try some turkish coffee for a change.  But an Oil is an Oil is an Oil.
3874 2018-08-09 16:55:58 죄송해요 앞으로 말 안 걸게요,, 오늘 진짜 용기내서 마음만 찍다가 멘션한 건데 제가 넘 장난식으로 말했나봐요.
3875 2018-08-09 16:55:48 It looks like a collision to me as water and oil, black & white,  right & left, stupid & smart it seems like a division made by men at the top!!
3876 2018-08-09 16:55:45 Your country is nothing! The thing you've got is oil! No manufacturing nothing your produce nothing! The west can cut you off at any moment and your country will collapse!
3877 2018-08-09 16:55:34 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3878 2018-08-09 16:55:34 Nope you have not understood what Jesus said or meant, or what actually happened. You are blind to what was and is happening. You are like the foolish virgin who did not buy oil and will not be ready for our Lords return.
3879 2018-08-09 16:55:28 See if we have a space force we can find space oil which is worth like 20x more money than normal oil.
3880 2018-08-09 16:55:10 No-Venezuela problems began well before Chavez started getting sick. When oil prices hit $140 in 2008 he wrongly thought they would remain in that level forever because Peak Oil~he began expropriating private propertyinvestors confidence&stealing-Chavez Model sunkand Maduro
3881 2018-08-09 16:55:05 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for #Alzheimer's disease.

3883 2018-08-09 16:54:57 Shhhh, don’t tell him. Remember how fun Nov 2016 was? It’s better as a suprise
3884 2018-08-09 16:54:54 Don’t blow out your PC with an air compressor on full blast (100+ psi) or without an oil/moisture catch on the air line. Otherwise you can break caps, force liquid into seals, etc. We followed this religiously at my computer store back in the day.
3885 2018-08-09 16:54:52 @KiehlsUKI !!! Calendula face wash and midnight recovery oil and I love collagen face masks :)
3886 2018-08-09 16:54:52 NATIONALIZE Canadian oil NOW!  Pull out of Opec and quit pissing away our ace in the hole to have oil when the world runs dry and we are the only ones with oil left we will all be millionaires.
3887 2018-08-09 16:54:42 Is the US really so dependent from Saudi oil that they just let them do anything? Look how they just treated Canada, a US ally, but Trump rather sides with Autocrats than long time allies, friends and neighbors. 
3888 2018-08-09 16:54:29 Export raw and import refined is very true. It applies to much more than just oil, we literally export Canadian jobs every day. It has been this way since Mulroney signed free trade in the 80’s and has seen the steady decline of  manufacturing ever since. #Imperialism
3889 2018-08-09 16:54:15 hahahahahahaha
3890 2018-08-09 16:54:15 A Turkey sub with hummus, avocado, crunchy onions, lettuce, tomato, light mayo, jalapeños, salt and pepper, with oil and vinegar >>>>>> 
3891 2018-08-09 16:54:14 A great big huge excuse to keep oil, gas, and coal energies around so rich people can continue getting more rich off of them. Kill the planet. They dont care. They have all the money right?

3892 2018-08-09 16:54:09 Most presidents won't either, the U.S. role as the currency of oil trading, AKA the petrodollar, props up the value of U.S. fiat currency, in a deal worked during the Nixon admin. w/OPEC nations.
3893 2018-08-09 16:54:09 Please read my last tweet again. Electric transportation decreases demand for oil.
3894 2018-08-09 16:54:03 #oott  hard to see russia not ramping up oil production after ther new US sanctions
3895 2018-08-09 16:54:00 Trudeau has worked diligently for a cleaner environment, but he has many more responsibilities than the environment alone. We rely heavily on electricity gas and heating oil.  I don't want any more Saudi oil in N.B. I want Canadian oil from Alberta! #KeepCanadaWorking
3896 2018-08-09 16:53:59 Saudi will be screwed when the oil runs out.
3897 2018-08-09 16:53:58 Is the US really so dependent from Saudi oil that they just let them do anything? Look how they just treated Canada, a US ally, but Trump rather sides with Autocrats than long time allies, friends and neighbors.
3898 2018-08-09 16:53:52 I've been trying not to let my car leaking trans oil get to me.. But it's getting worse.
3899 2018-08-09 16:53:45 The new tax law — which slices corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent, slashes estate taxes and includes a special deduction for oil and gas investors — is expected to save the Koch brothers and their businesses billions of dollars in taxes.
3900 2018-08-09 16:53:38 What are the injuries or what make the APC make us to believe and may be you tell me how much oil per barrel during the 16 years and how much they borrow. Please bro think we'll and through.
3901 2018-08-09 16:53:31 The Alberta oil sands are a world class operation. And once the TMP is built we will be able to sell our product on the world market fetching the top dollar like the rest of the oil producing countries. 
And who's this "we"? Canada is leaps and bounds ahead of the U.S. enviro.
3902 2018-08-09 16:53:30 Which Oil money
3903 2018-08-09 16:53:26 I cant even imagine, the scars aren’t nice looking? But with time it will heal and the scars will get smaller, keep putting coconut oil, and ice the area it’s supposed to make the skin tighter. And it’s good for acne as well. Pero lmk when I’m open for u

3905 2018-08-09 16:53:23 I like how they’re spinning it that they’re doing us a favor. I’d stop taking their oil too, Fk it. Newfoundland and Alberta can supply it for us
3906 2018-08-09 16:53:09 Whats most disconcerting is a lack of response from our Allies who also (supposedly) represent the values of democracy. How many troops did we send to war after 9-11? WWII? WWI? Looks to me like oil rules the world, everything else is secondary.
3907 2018-08-09 16:53:08 Sainsbury's do  organic unfiltered virgin olive oil £3.25 it seems very nice xx
3908 2018-08-09 16:53:05 Just left the gym now I’m getting an oil change

3910 2018-08-09 16:52:45 Cocoa butter & baby oil
3911 2018-08-09 16:52:37 Just spent my lunch break buying listerine, baby oil, and preparation h. Yay horse ownership?
3912 2018-08-09 16:52:33 Fuck their oil. We have enough. Just got to upgrade the infrastructure.
3913 2018-08-09 16:52:15 If only there was someplace else we could get oil. /sarc
3914 2018-08-09 16:51:57 저 상처 받았어요...
3915 2018-08-09 16:51:41 The us auto industry were all bailed out in 2008 and are heavily subsidized via oil & gas, maybe just stay in your mom's basement
3916 2018-08-09 16:51:35 Aliyu Saleem, it is not ur fault, wen u guys in ur state busy enjoying oil money from another state , don’t worry soon the story will change , how many bills ur uncles have pass ,.
3917 2018-08-09 16:51:26 Using tights now. Do have baby oil tho
3918 2018-08-09 16:51:24 Then that's what they should do. Our country, Canada, is a vast nation w/ very well educated and highly skilled population, for the most part, our internal productions should serve our needs, and excess production may be shipped away. Why produce more oil than we need, go solar!
3919 2018-08-09 16:51:22 Oh, goodie, the anti-science guys r going 2 give us a science lesson.  Censored of course, we mustn't mention the earth is baking to a crisp.  Might cost the oil companies a few excess profits.
3920 2018-08-09 16:51:19 平和島という名前がってこと？
3921 2018-08-09 16:51:18 . Shall we accept their oil now. We can say no until Saudi Arabia release whose arrested. Will you petition the Trudeau gov to do that?  Womenas' rights matter and what better way to help than to say no to buying oil any longer from that country?
3922 2018-08-09 16:51:13 fresh oil changes 
3923 2018-08-09 16:51:08 #buckabeer Why is he sticking his nose in beer prices? What a crazy thing to be spending his efforts on. And why does he even get to do this? What next, buck a haircut, buck an oil change? Leave it alone df and get to work on some actual issues.
3924 2018-08-09 16:51:02 so compared to other moisturizers it doesnt have that. tacky sticky feeling. for ppl that has oily skin it feels greasy for them, but for me my dry skin LOVES it bc it lasts longer thru the day. if my skin dries out then my skin makes oil faster
3925 2018-08-09 16:50:56 ... something about US buying a million barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia every single day.

3927 2018-08-09 16:50:40 I burned all my plastic straws with some diesel fuel and used automotive oil. And since I was getting rid of that, I threw a bunch of old tires in the fire. Unfortunately the smoke was pretty intense. Can anyone loan me some carbon credits?
3928 2018-08-09 16:50:37 Coconut oil is King
3929 2018-08-09 16:50:31 Btw, not a minority opinion, at all, imho.
I doubt that the wheat prod. sector has been substantially strengthened in recent yrs. A few military projects (that turn out to be too big to handle), low gas/oil prices and one or another bad harvest, and he'll be in deep trouble.
3930 2018-08-09 16:50:29 With everything that’s going on in the world rn u chose 2 write about this?!? Get your act together. Smh Btw I’m conservative too. Learn 2 write substance not foolishness. “Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom & honor”
Ecc 10:1
3931 2018-08-09 16:50:26 Then stop driving and flying cuz millions of people are being slaughtered in Middle East, Iraq War just one example, so the oil can be stolen.

3933 2018-08-09 16:50:20 @Shell £21 for a litre of oil is absolutely criminal. Over 4x the price of my local garage. An Engine malfunction meant I had to buy fuel at your garage and I genuinely feel like I'm being mugged rverytime I hand over any money to your ridiculous establishment. For shame.
3934 2018-08-09 16:50:18 Cbd oil/treats. They make them specifically for dogs
3935 2018-08-09 16:50:18 @tvcnewsng the truth is.. Govt have never taken the education seriously. As long as oil is still coming out, education can never be given the required priority. #jh

3939 2018-08-09 16:49:56 It's as if they gave the money away, giving the public the 'old snake oil salesman' tale that most of it would percolate down to the working people. Instead, they sucked the system dry, strip-mined the gov coffers and have flooded the swamp with toxic corruption. #BlueWave2018
3940 2018-08-09 16:49:50 Wait a minute, now you want Canada to produce oil?!
3941 2018-08-09 16:49:47 Dan levy took over a consistent 7-10th place finisher and has them in a new 60k plus stadium and three straight years in champions league, no oil money, no big investments.
3942 2018-08-09 16:49:39 Archaeologists discovered ancient nigella seeds, dating from around 1650 BCE, in a Hittite flask in north-central Turkey and the ancient Egyptians thought black seed oil was important enough to include in the tomb of one of their pharaohs.

3946 2018-08-09 16:49:23 Suddenly, the government took everything and the country started to suffer this. Those are facts, not assumptions. Every venezuelan would prefer having US companies in charge of the Oil industry but to stay alive than having a total control of the government and die.

3953 2018-08-09 16:48:53 vitex, DIM, evening primrose oil, inositol, magnesium and maca are just some of the hormone-balancing supplements  to reverse my PCOS.
3954 2018-08-09 16:48:46 Just pulled up to Lucas Oil... This feels surreal. Up until now, I’ve only seen this place through a computer screen...
3955 2018-08-09 16:48:35 Albertas oil is better you just have the proper refinery.
3956 2018-08-09 16:48:32 My lovely courgettes are doing well. Lovely roasted with garlic and olive oil.
3957 2018-08-09 16:48:28 We should build a transcanadian pipeline and more refineries, there are already refineries across Canada, we should build what we need to meet our needs and produce our own gas with our own oil...
3958 2018-08-09 16:48:28 There have been activities of US Oil companies in Venezuela in the past. They had to share their revenues, to pay royalties, to make investments as part of their corporate social responsibility and so on. The same happened with other foreign companies
3959 2018-08-09 16:48:26 #PM_Abiye’s reform is his ambition; occupation, not the plight of the people. 

He wants to rob the oil/gas rich nation of #Ogadenia. That’s why there is military presence in the #Somali region.
3960 2018-08-09 16:48:17 Well, I bet your happy that our so called government will keep importing their oil. That will really show them. Hypocrites.
3961 2018-08-09 16:48:15 My day was going too well

I'm a fucking disaster 

Splashed hot oil over my wrist and soaked through my top onto my chest.
3962 2018-08-09 16:48:08 ACA is a disaster. FFS. How about we make ACA live up to its snake oil salsemans promise.  'If you like you Dr. you can keep your Dr. If you like your coverage, you can keep your coverage"  else, repeal it flat out. Status quo Ante.
3963 2018-08-09 16:47:58 와 겨론해요
3964 2018-08-09 16:47:57 Is it or is it not abortion instructions in the Bible? The reading comp in this country I swear. And I’m pretty sure JESUS was cool as shit and did not put up with women being shamed for shit. See Mary with the oil and the woman who was gonna get stoned.
3965 2018-08-09 16:47:53  YASS use some shimmer spray/oil, and you GOOD
3966 2018-08-09 16:47:52 Remember that the Saudis pay environmental groups in Canada to oppose and fight against Canadian oil and gas development.
3967 2018-08-09 16:47:51 We will even sell them power, water, food and whiskey to console them in their new found utopia. Scotland can feed itself, create its own power, has water a plenty and of course oil..England has...its independence and control over its own borders...yay!
3968 2018-08-09 16:47:42 Florida is already planning and budgeting for encroachment from the ocean. Inundation along the Eastern Seaboard is predicted to seriously impair major cities unless action is taken to fend off rising tides. Stop reading sources who want to maintain oil profits.
3969 2018-08-09 16:47:42 The Average Person in the USA uses more than 1 Gallon of GASOLINE per day...burning 1 gallon of Gas releases more than 18 pounds of Carbon    Dioxide into the atmosphere...BIG Business-A Barrel of Crude Oil (42 Gallons) produces about 19 Gallons of GASOLINE.
3970 2018-08-09 16:47:42 We should not, i repeat not be buying any oil from them. Its so ridiculous when we are literally sitting on one of the largest pools and yet we buy from dictators at premium prices. If i ran my farm that way people would call me stupid.
3971 2018-08-09 16:47:28 His government owns an oil pipeline right?
3972 2018-08-09 16:47:24 We are a cold weather country, until we can find an alternative we need our oil across the country. Who believes that a pipeline is more dangerous to our environment than the tens of thousands of ships, trains and tractor trailers hauling oil and gas nationally #KeepCanadaWorking
3973 2018-08-09 16:47:21 canada stops pipeline, looses it's share of market, that share will be taken by some dictatorship and demand for oil will not decrease, we just continue to sell our oil at deep discount, how do we win? are you living in a buble?
3974 2018-08-09 16:47:20 mmm you know that oil they put on your nails after a manicure that makes you feel like you just got done eating 20 greasy chicken nugs.. love that stuff
3975 2018-08-09 16:47:18 I agree Michelle, but I can't wait to see what all those self-righteous pipeline saboteurs will do when Saudi cuts off their supply of "dirty" oil to Canada. Haha! Who's sorry now?
3976 2018-08-09 16:47:14 first grow the weed , then dont use solvent from the petrochimical industries to make ur oil
3977 2018-08-09 16:47:13 u will never regret adding more oil to the pan
3978 2018-08-09 16:47:05 You think you have it rough on Army bases, allow me to regale you with tales of Marine Corps Bases. There’s only so much that pine oil can do. #BornAgainHard #OldCorps #USMC #PineOil #FieldDay
3979 2018-08-09 16:47:03 All the bank directors including those who speak in tongues and anointed with palm oil should be prosecuted not forgetting the regulators who were sleeping on the job
3980 2018-08-09 16:47:02 I love how the oil change place--EVEN ON THEIR WEBSITE--refuses to show ACTUAL PRICES. Instead, they display "coupons" for "$7 off" or other "$X off." I absolutely DESPISE going into anything "financially blind" with zero true idea of MY "final after everything" price to pay!
3981 2018-08-09 16:47:00 Better than other types of fat. Most people aren’t willing to remove all oil from their diet.
3982 2018-08-09 16:47:00 @OliDavis @ThisisLukeOwen @WrestleTalk_TV can’t wait for @Cultaholic to sing toto Africa at wrestling media con going to be hilarious. Oil and Luke are going to win WRESTLETALK FOREVER!!! #SupportWrestleTalk
3983 2018-08-09 16:46:53 I really love Krispy Kreme coffee! I add a teaspoon of virgin coconut oil and some Sweet Italian Creme flavored creamer. Mmmmmm so good!
3984 2018-08-09 16:46:18 There oil in nicaragua?If not,there no regime changes planned for you.
3985 2018-08-09 16:46:16 All Republicans need to bring this issue up with their Local, State, and National lawmakers. Social media has become a monopoly and it needs to be regulated just like the oil companies had to be regulated. Censoring thought from either side of the aisle is very dangerous.
3986 2018-08-09 16:46:14 The middle East has been fighting with each other for 10000 years or more. If oil was not involved the West would have zero interest. MBS wants to bring SA into the 21st century but you can not do that controlling your country via fear over Twitter. Imagine if we all got along.

4000 2018-08-09 16:44:22 Justin isn’t the voice of a country ruled by the banking elite who also happen to be the oil elite who have the unfortunate need to always protect their investments and supply in the Middle East. Go along to get along or get attacked. SA or Libya, doesn’t matter.
4001 2018-08-09 16:44:21 cars so damn needy. everytime I turn around it need something .. tires, oil change, gas

4004 2018-08-09 16:43:55 Don't forget the sanctions and bad actors at the top of Venezuelan society sabotaging the economy to turn public opinion against the Bolivarians. Also, keep in mind that Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, while Yemen currently has the worst humanitarian crisis.
4005 2018-08-09 16:43:49 Oil sands, we don't dig for tar. It's a petroleum byproduct but it sounds so much more sexy for eco-wackos.
4006 2018-08-09 16:43:45 Who supported a dirty oil pipeline. But yeah
4007 2018-08-09 16:43:43 Yo the mechanic that did my oil change jus gas me the biggest discount....I’m feeling the love today universe keep it coming

4014 2018-08-09 16:43:05 Regarding the Space Force; Who is this for? Have the defense contractors decided that murdering innocent brown people isn't netting them enough cash? Is Elon excited about "owning" Mars?

Are the Evangelicals and Oil Barons trying to replace NASA because facts hurt their profits?
4015 2018-08-09 16:43:04 Gotta do the oil trick
4016 2018-08-09 16:42:58 You had TSN in 1988? Lucky bastard, I thought only, like, royalty and oil barons did.
4017 2018-08-09 16:42:57 I'm glad it made you smile Heid but I wasnt  joking.
4018 2018-08-09 16:42:39 You will have to answer Mr.@NitishKumar why you are making silence on such type of Heinous crime..

What you understand we would be like earlier generation by keeping oil in  #MithilawithBuchiya के साथ अगर न्याय नहीं हुआ तो,समय असली औकात बताएगा
4019 2018-08-09 16:42:26 Without oil the Saudis would be spending all their time having camel races.

4024 2018-08-09 16:41:47 NO ONE WOULD DARE SAY ANYTHING TO HARPER BECAUSE THERE WAS GREAT CONCERN THAT IF HE DIDNT GET WHAT HE WANTED HE WOULD START PRODUCING SO MUCH OIL THAT IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A WORLD WIDE CLIMATE GONOCIDE IN 6 MONTHS SO EVEN RUSSIA WAS SCARED 
4025 2018-08-09 16:41:33 Ok everybody .... the magic phrase for the week is "Big Oil"  ..... Every time a libbie says it you need to take a drink ...

4027 2018-08-09 16:41:22 These "global enforcement mechanisms", as in US sanctions, are responsible for the suffering of the Venezuelan people.

A country with the largest oil reserves in the world doesn't just collapse because of a "dictatorship", imagined or otherwise.
4028 2018-08-09 16:41:13 Yo I said change my fuel filter not drop my fucking oil

4031 2018-08-09 16:40:44 Weak federal governments, of any stripe.
BC and Quebec block much needed pipelines to transport our oil even to our own refineries.
Rail used to move oil means grain cant move to ports.
4032 2018-08-09 16:40:39 Until mid January when it's -25C the Saudis change their mind and cut oil sales.
4033 2018-08-09 16:40:23 Right? It’s like, does it look like a greasy oil slick otherwise?

4035 2018-08-09 16:40:14 I'm on the #Keto diet, which is a very low-carb, high-fat diet. Ghee is high in fat w/o the lactose. When used with MCT oil, it provides greater energy, converts fat to energy, increases cognitive function and reduces hunger through the morning. It also tastes good with coffee!

Pure oils, full spectrum oils, liquids, salves, capsules, and even vape cartridges are available. 
4041 2018-08-09 16:39:23 There is , of course, NO uranium. Nor gold, diamonds, natural gas, oil..Its just dust and rocks and sagebrush.
4042 2018-08-09 16:39:22 Ya, keep dreaming.  Oil usage has increased worldwide every year & will continue to increase for years. Canada produces 1.8% of world GHG output in a large cold country. A 5% reduction, while impossible, would be a less than .1% of world output-or in lay terms, a fart in the wind

4051 2018-08-09 16:38:33 Cut off energy to all those who protest oil pipelines, and there should be enough left for the rest of us!
4052 2018-08-09 16:38:31 Any essential oil people out there? I have several questions.
4053 2018-08-09 16:38:25 Did we turn the oil tankers back?
4054 2018-08-09 16:38:15 Note to self: Do not buy Apple Cinnamon Fragrance Oil for your house. Every time you walk into your house it will give you flashbacks of hungover Fireball Whisky nights. #NeverAgain #IveSaidThatBefore

4058 2018-08-09 16:37:28 If I was lying face down right now I could strike oil with my knob

4060 2018-08-09 16:37:16 Over @realDonaldTrump any day, but @JustinTrudeau has also said things like "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and leave them there" Sure sounds like a human rights abuse to me.
4061 2018-08-09 16:37:09 We should say Screw SA and start using our own oil ressources. But @JustinTrudeau would Rather keep sending billions. How is this helping climate change by the way?

4063 2018-08-09 16:37:05 You cant compete with teams who are owned by oil countries, and cup comps can be one by anyone, nor do we have a bad squad at all, year on year we get outspent and then outperform all of them
4064 2018-08-09 16:37:05 There is something that is called the 'Truth', if Trump is able to tell it, then he will have had no problem with the Mueller's questions. When you have a lying snake oil salesman then there is a fear that he won't be able to tell the same story a few minutes later
4065 2018-08-09 16:36:50 This.... 1000% this!

I've been saying this for days. With all the crying about where oil comes from why doesn't anyone bring this up?

Why is all the oil from Nfld exported instead of used in Canada?
4066 2018-08-09 16:36:47 Working my way through the 4 kinds of zucchini bread I made last wknd & loving all of them! (Used 8 lbs of zucchini, yet I still have 6 zucchinis at home...)

- Lemon Rosemary Loaf

- Lavender Lemon Cake
4067 2018-08-09 16:36:46 Oh I know! The Olive oil started in Ancient Greece but the crisco....they didn’t say who came up with the idea but it was in the 1970s. EWWWW
4068 2018-08-09 16:36:33 Nor can it now. For all the activism against oil there is still no real viable alternative either technologically or economically.
4069 2018-08-09 16:36:19 入ろうとしたら埋まってました・・・ｗ
4070 2018-08-09 16:36:13 @cafreeland We need to ban Saudi oil in this country. Extend no olive branch or anything that might be construed as such. Humanity is on our side.
4071 2018-08-09 16:36:09 What win? Lmao ...they aren't even stopping oil shipments...actually it makes the Saudis look pretty bad picking a fight with one of the most highly regarded countries in the world
4072 2018-08-09 16:36:04 Now would be an excellent time to stop buying their oil and build a pipeline to the east coast.
4073 2018-08-09 16:36:01 Paddling pool, baby oil, 3 some, court injunction on UK reporting. Not told the truth, priceless !
4074 2018-08-09 16:35:58 Canada should become self- sufficient and ship our oil East...And drop Saudi oil. Unfortunately, the same people supposedly protesting human rights violations protest Canadian oil - less than brilliant!!! But typically eastern Canadian.
4075 2018-08-09 16:35:57 Start the “ENERGY EAST” line and use Canadian crude back east - stop importing oil from Countries you take aim at over human rights issues. Countries that dump all investment and purchases from Canada. 
Seriously- Alberta is not the enemy. Time to support the home team
4076 2018-08-09 16:35:56 Tea tree oil was the best thing for my skin
4077 2018-08-09 16:35:52 @JustinTrudeau @jkenney @RachelNotley it’s about time that we concentrate on becoming self sufficient with our energy needs. Why are we importing oil? Why are we concentrating on pipelines to get our oil out and having to buy oil for our needs?
4078 2018-08-09 16:35:49 I lost my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier watch and waited to see what the new Galaxy Watch would look like and all the specs and stuff. I'm just gonna get another Frontier. The oil boy thing I like about the Galaxy Watch is the water resistance.
4079 2018-08-09 16:35:49 Migration of Africans to Europe is cuz during colonisation no education/training was given to locals. And even after leaving Africa, the Britishers, French& Belgians businesses still control& exploits the African assets (minerals,diamonds,oil& gas).No local industries established

4082 2018-08-09 16:35:16 That’s because it benefits them! Cut them off! We shouldn’t be buying oil from them after what they’ve done!
4083 2018-08-09 16:35:15 2) Saudis are strategic partners with the West in so many ways. Oil. Economy. Middle East geopolitics. Who bailed out the West during 2008 recession? How many leaders went to Saudis cap in hand? Alienating them brings serious consequences

4088 2018-08-09 16:34:58 So in this one does he explain what happened to that Afghan oil pipeline he said Bush was going to build in the first movie?

4092 2018-08-09 16:34:12 yt vegans piss me off talking shit about a native CHILD catching his first whale. i don’t see ur energy over oil spills in oceans & native lands, overfishing of fish that whales and coastal natives need to survive, and the slaughtering of whales for sport. go cry in europe 
4093 2018-08-09 16:34:09 I just wanna know why my hair gets oily so fast. I literally took a shower last night and it already looks like I jumped in the ocean in the middle of an oil spill 
4094 2018-08-09 16:34:05 I use Aveeno naturally bright line. I like the glow it gives me and Cetaphil cleanser at night since it’s really light weight. Only moisturize will Apricot or Almond Oil. Raw Brown sugar+ Raw Honey and Almond Oil for exfoliant.

4097 2018-08-09 16:33:48 Trump is just a snake oil salesman but this man is a dangerous lunatic.
4098 2018-08-09 16:33:33 Of course Saudi Arabia will continue selling oil to Canada, and of course Canada will continue buying oil from Saudi Arabia.  Why would virtue-signalling over human rights get in the way of our demand for fossil fuels (which, of course, fits right into our "climate action" plan)?
4099 2018-08-09 16:33:27 Note to those out there thinking about buying a new car. Please ask your dealership to introduce you to one of their mechanics who can verbally walk you through changing a tire, checking your oil, water & other fluids on your new vehicle.

4102 2018-08-09 16:33:06 It may be politically handy to blame Trudeau, but he had nothing to do with it. While Energy East's investment potential was already down because of persistently weak oil prices, Donald Trump delivered a fatal kick to any economic case by approving Keystone XL.
4103 2018-08-09 16:32:58 I made an argument to an anti-Saudi Leftist once who always complained of western countries going to war in Middle Eastern countries for oil. I said the US has enough oil to supply itself in Alaska and the midwest yet 'environmentalists' always block new pipelines and drilling.
4104 2018-08-09 16:32:35 thing is, your hair produces grease way faster because you wash your hair more. thats kinda the only thing that sucks about changing ur hair routine cus ur gonna have greasy hair for a few weeks until your hair gets used to the fact that it doesnt have to rush oil production
4105 2018-08-09 16:32:28 They finally found oil in space?
4106 2018-08-09 16:32:24 We need to flood European and Asian markets with our wealth of oil sands.
4107 2018-08-09 16:32:15 I always wondered, all those cars Q built with machine guns, oil slick, bullet proof shield and other clever items, but never mentioned air conditioning or seat belts...I suspect he really hated Bond.
4108 2018-08-09 16:32:14 I need to go get my oil changed. I would have to wait til next Friday tho.
4109 2018-08-09 16:32:07 In my coffee I put coconut oil, mct oil, ghee and stevia. No creamer. #BulletProofCoffee #ketolifestyle

4111 2018-08-09 16:31:48 So they are okay with pulling back study abroad and some minor dealings, but don't touch the oil ... are they taking diplomacy lessons from Trump?
4112 2018-08-09 16:31:39 Since I'm in the middle of doing my laundry now, I only have one more thing to check off my errand list to be ready for school to start back up: getting the oil changed on my car.

4118 2018-08-09 16:31:19 Canada shouldn’t be buying their oil! If they are going to cut us off by selling their assets, stopping flights and asking students to return home. We shouldn’t  be giving them billions for their oil! #eyeforandeye
4119 2018-08-09 16:31:16 Na I am certain billionaires bro. Igbos are the business pillars of this country. They dominate everything business except oil and gas which isn’t in their region but still lots of them are third party contractors. Every other tribe either got their money from politics and oil.
4120 2018-08-09 16:30:46 So Iran is upping their missles to shoot at Israel and oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz!!!  That is not fake!!

4128 2018-08-09 16:29:56 Basically This man is saying; “Oil matters”? “But Humans Don’t”, weird..  Strong!
4129 2018-08-09 16:29:53 Switching from gas to diesel or electricity will reduce our oil imports in general. Much of Ontario gas is also imported (from the US).

4132 2018-08-09 16:29:33 This is our best kept secret.  It's the real deal alternative to the enticing "lift and shift" and "your mess for less" snake oil in the market.
4133 2018-08-09 16:29:33 lbc of dieting i cant cook things with mayo, canola oil or butter so ive developed a liking for olive oil
4134 2018-08-09 16:29:09 It’s definitely a fantasy world, and not at all technologically advanced... I suppose they do advance from candles to oil lamps in 200 years.  The plot is more wrapped up in the politics of the world. And loss, when you’re outliving everyone around you.
4135 2018-08-09 16:29:00 Dope pics from the photo shoot from Tuesday for #CannaComedy2018 big thanks to @maxamillionm for the fresh photos and our sponsors @select_oil @deanzgreebzpdx @dankteez12 NW Cannabis Club #SmokinAndJoking #PuffPuffLaugh #CannaComedy
4136 2018-08-09 16:28:56 Getting oil change for my car. Car maintenance is important but also I’m so uncomfortable being the only woman in the store. At least there’s a coupon.
4137 2018-08-09 16:28:51 i look so lost coming to get my oil changed, joshua usually does this for me.. 
4138 2018-08-09 16:28:48 No way. It's so different. Usually eat my cucumber in a salad with oil and vinegar.
4139 2018-08-09 16:28:43 CBD oil. Talk to me. I need alllll the deets. 
4140 2018-08-09 16:28:40 Challenging you on this. It is disgusting that the Kingdom gets to behave as it wishes because money, because oil, because trade, because real politik...when do we challenge cruel tyranny? They crucify people there. No due process...onandonandonandon. STOP!
4141 2018-08-09 16:28:12 Kinda burying the lede that they discovered oil in space
4142 2018-08-09 16:28:03 Is this not the guy who knocked our government N$800 mill with his olive oil fake project? Is he drilling on Twitter now? Twitter be warned! Takamisa mbuaje Twitter! Just sell your fake dreams Munene!
4143 2018-08-09 16:27:42 Trump taps into Andromeda's oil. Gas is now .05 cents a gallon.

4144 2018-08-09 16:27:41 waited til my car had 3% oil to call and make the appointment luckily the dealership can do it at 2 today cause they’re always booked. Lol why am i like this.
4145 2018-08-09 16:27:31 Is it the same quality / type of oil?
4146 2018-08-09 16:27:28 I think I've figured out how to monetize Facebook--charge a fee to everyone who wants me to hawk gigs, Shakeology, books, Mary Kay, CDs, articles, MLM essential oil, etc., on my page.

4150 2018-08-09 16:27:01 Do you live in this world OR somewhere else? Saudi government have stopped oil supply to USA in 1971 , late Prince SAUD AL FISSL shut the telephone during communication with Hilary during BAHRAIN interventions.Obama received by 4th degree employer at Riyadh air port.
4151 2018-08-09 16:26:57 I don't know about you world but Canada being the only one to stand up to the Saudi Arabia oil teet makes me fuckin Eh proud. Nice work @cafreeland @JustinTrudeau Human rights are worth the cost.
4152 2018-08-09 16:26:56 Um ok WTF. Took my car in for an oil change and accidentally left my whole key chain and they stole my F***ING BABY GROOT off of it !!!! WHAT is wrong w people jeez not Louise bc Louise is probably nicer than that
4153 2018-08-09 16:26:50 I love the techs that change oil. They always try and convince you that you need to purchase unnecessary shit
4154 2018-08-09 16:26:45 Betting Big Oil  is regretting pulling up stakes from our oilsands.
Alberta should be refining our own products. 
 Hopefully we have a very cold winter this year and observe the antics of our Clown Prince scrambling as he scrambles 2 heat the East. Then again,perhaps he does SFA.
4155 2018-08-09 16:26:25 Hahahahaha Turdeau killed Energy East and continues to allow 100,000 barrels per day of SA oil in the country. Turdhead doesn't want Alberta oil. Middle Eastern dictatorships fuel cars in Ontario and Quebec not Canadian oil.
4156 2018-08-09 16:26:13 We dont need thier dirty oil,we should have stopped buying thier dirty oil years ago ,maybe would have more pipe lines by now.
4157 2018-08-09 16:26:04 BS it’s not big Oil. It’s been proven that EPA has eliminated jobs for the private sector. Other countries have capitalized on our jobs and have no EPA restrictions. If you want a world economy we must all have an even playing field.
4158 2018-08-09 16:25:51 Nothing special. Steam, wash, Clarify, Aloe + Rose water, then moisturize for day. I just wash and moisturize at night. Getting a night cream this weekend and tea tree oil for occasional spot treatment.
4159 2018-08-09 16:25:41 Normally tea tree oil
4160 2018-08-09 16:25:36 You could to I don’t see what’s laughable about stopping purchasing oil from a terrorist regime when we have plenty of oil here at home and plenty of other countries to do business with that don’t state sponsor terrorism and threaten us with 9/11 style attacks. Foh.
4161 2018-08-09 16:25:34 I don't think they traveled the way Mark Twain did, experiencing other cultures and meeting ordinary people. They're millionaires, oil men whose only goals in their travels are to enrich themselves politically and financially. They're more like colonists than travelers.
4162 2018-08-09 16:25:23 Cheap oil and filter
4163 2018-08-09 16:25:20 For the long term, we should "drill baby drill" and exploit our oil in Canada. However, for the very short term, this is some good news.

4165 2018-08-09 16:25:10 Dude I hang out with climate scientists, I understand the science, I just spent a week with a bunch of oil and gas consultants who accepted AGW. I cant take you seriously.
4166 2018-08-09 16:25:00 During WW 2, 42 drillers, derrick men, motormen and roustabouts from Nobel drilling secretly went to England to help with oil production. with four rigs, the men began drilling, completing wells in an average of 1/week, where the Brits were making 1/5weeks.
4167 2018-08-09 16:24:50 Did not know #Canada actually has the worlds largest recoverable #Oil reserves in the world...  

And we - the @liberal_party - is trying to shut down the industry?

4171 2018-08-09 16:24:12 @PrinceBinSalman It is time the Western World let Saudi Arabia know it is not a democracy. It is run by idiots who stole the people's oil and exploit and control the country. Morally, Saudi Arabia is a third world country
4172 2018-08-09 16:24:03 And . . . As the captain of the team who has developed a habit to burn the midnight oil since his predebut days, I just can’t join them yet.
4173 2018-08-09 16:24:00 I’m pretty sure her and Danny had an amicable split cause she wanted to raise her kids how her parents did when they divorced; aka having a non-toxic relationship  She said her and Danny were like “water and oil” 
4174 2018-08-09 16:23:53 Dude, you know that’s a bad fake photo, right???  Go sell some more snake oil 
4175 2018-08-09 16:23:51 Oh so they will huff and puff and pull all their students. But not the oil. We keep selling the oil? Is that really what I just read?
4176 2018-08-09 16:23:38 coconut oil everywhere
4177 2018-08-09 16:23:34 So they are ok to take billions of dollars from Canada for their cheep/Islamic oil. While our inept prime minister @JustinTrudeau hate Canadian oil.

4181 2018-08-09 16:22:42 Can’t stand when ppl want to have a discussion and refer to the bleak sparknotes summary version of very controversial topics. 

“Terrorists hate us because we take their oil...”

Idk Susan there’s a lot to discuss in there.
4182 2018-08-09 16:22:36 They going to charge me 60 dollars for a oil change. I’m going to eat 60 dollars worth of snacks in this dealership
4183 2018-08-09 16:22:31 For anyone who thinks I have my life together, let me paint you a picture: I’m lying on my sofa with my left ear full of olive oil because I have ear wax buildup, strawberry lace hanging halfway from my mouth and I’m singing along to Linger by Cranberries Acoustic Karaoke on YT.
4184 2018-08-09 16:22:29 Oh surly bike shop staff member, if you hadn't been so rude I would have pointed out that's DOT fluid you're putting into mineral oil system, that display bikes going to need some work now.

4200 2018-08-09 16:19:46 Even MSNBC and NPR are basically owned by oil and gas.
4201 2018-08-09 16:19:37 75% of oil used in the US is used for gasoline 47%, diesel and heating oil 20% and jet fuel8%. We can reduce that significantly. We should also find alternatives for the other petroleum based products but most of it is still used for energy production which we can replace.
4202 2018-08-09 16:19:27 PHASE out oil and gas. @JerryBrownGov
4203 2018-08-09 16:19:27 My parents never would have watched a movie with “virgin” in the title.
They wouldn’t even buy olive oil.
4204 2018-08-09 16:19:24 You wonder how much larger the cars would have gotten if the oil shock hadn’t happened- of course now the Trump rules are going to flood US streets with SUVs even more than they are now

4211 2018-08-09 16:18:56 Only 1 refinery in Canada imports oil from Saudi Arabia - The Irving refinery in NB. They could choose to exclusively refine oil from Newfoundland. Most of Nfld's oil has to be refined in the USA. Why does Irving prefer Saudi oil to Cdn oil from Newfoundland? #nbpoli #cdnpoli
4212 2018-08-09 16:18:42 telur, sm dada ayam digoreng tp pake olive oil gorengnya. sayurnya brokoli direbus
4213 2018-08-09 16:18:37 The Koch Brothers father made his money building oil refineries and aviation fuel refineries for the Nazis. Also its a bit of a meme on the chans to be desperate and bleak and falling apart.
4214 2018-08-09 16:18:32 Self-destructive until the last drop of oil. That's the spirit!
4215 2018-08-09 16:18:31 I probably missed this but Canada is an oil producer. Why don’t we use our own or go green ? Less dependent on others .

4217 2018-08-09 16:17:49 Doesnt' Envigo specialise in vegetarian products ?  so why on earth is there a picture of "meat" attached - it should be a picture of corn oil.
4218 2018-08-09 16:17:47 This oil will only catch a bid near the end of the month. It trades so badly.
4219 2018-08-09 16:17:47 Norway is not European but Scandinavian. They have oil money, something the UK does not have that as far as I know...
4220 2018-08-09 16:17:42 The Saudis bank roll everything. Their oil money is indefinite. It is truly amazing.
4221 2018-08-09 16:17:40 Lol, I just made money in both of them this series , for me its, oil mkt companies, always had a fear  of Gaps, so avoid trading on them, may be if I had courage like u, I would have made some more capital 
4222 2018-08-09 16:17:24 The fact a full body oil massage for 1 hour was £7. Like i defo need to move to Thailand 
4223 2018-08-09 16:17:23 All of those opposed to CDN oil and pipelines, simply google executions in Saudi Arabia and then explain to me how in any way buying their oil and supporting their economy is ok
4224 2018-08-09 16:17:13 I probably missed this . But Canada is an oil producer . Why not use our own or go green ??

4227 2018-08-09 16:16:58 I don't know, I see it as an opportunity (with a large cost to us granted) to detach ourselves from that retrograde terrorist nation. Can't reason with brainwashed people anyway. Can't wait till they run out of oil and fade into irrelevance. By

Pie in the sky I know
4228 2018-08-09 16:16:47 Government is not owned by oil and gas.   Talk about your conspiracy theories.  They can only lobby same as the people wanting this absurdity.   Again NOx, CFCs, etc did not require a indulgence tax for the sin.
4229 2018-08-09 16:16:39 With all due respect, the safest way to transport oil is a pipeline, least potential for catastrophic damage

4235 2018-08-09 16:15:58 I see everybody holding hands, forget about the reprimands.
No country for Tin Men, who function by oil cans.
Piece by piece, we roll together like rubber bands. Bouncing off empirical circumstance.
4236 2018-08-09 16:15:51 Because we do not have the refineries or pipelines to process bitumen/Dilbit.  USA Does.  Nova Scotia refineries need SA Crude oil, not bitumen.

4239 2018-08-09 16:15:39 Instead of going to bed last night I burned the midnight oil and wrote another chapter for Stay Dead 4. A few more nights like that and I’ll be done. #amwriting
4240 2018-08-09 16:15:36 It’s true. Trump is great. The US has a perfect health care system. Income equality is top notch, emissions are the lowest of the world and the US totally isn’t addicted to oil and unreasonably cheap gasoline. #itstrue

4245 2018-08-09 16:15:26 It's not just  asbestos issue.  It's the sum total of the epa, Scott Pruitt and changes to oil drilling benefiting friends of trump. Drilling in national parks. Less gas mileage requirements.  Pollution and clean water.
4246 2018-08-09 16:15:13 The only other competitive pricing compared to the Saudis is America. Canada needs to build their oil Independence and their high-level bitumen refineries while still purchasing American oil to keep prices down. Fuck Saudi oil.
4247 2018-08-09 16:15:13 Peaking oil prices?
4248 2018-08-09 16:15:06 They don´t have the oil money to buy it. But I like their philosophy more than all those other clubs spending completely brainless.
4249 2018-08-09 16:15:04 I really need to get and oil change and my car looked at. Sounds like the shits going to explode .
4250 2018-08-09 16:14:58 If u think SA is a stronger country than Canada think again. The only thing they have is oil. Guess what? They’re failing. Guess what else? Canada has oil & multiple other resources. We’re in a much stronger position, so FU!
4251 2018-08-09 16:14:51 Saudi’s still want to sell Quebec & Ontario Oil after all they’ve done LOL
My God We Look Stupid  
Saudi’s whipping Canada like we’re Saudi Women & Prisoners

Canada will be endorsing Saudi lack of Human Rights
4252 2018-08-09 16:14:49 Yes! Hahaha, I totally knocked my entire soft box into the full/hot bathtub just before starting that show. And I still have baby oil in my hair. And I did it all while having the world's worst period cramps. And it was AMAZING and fun, but not easy.

4258 2018-08-09 16:14:11 You can not compare us to Man City. On another level. They are funded by oil money. We had the youngest team past few years and finished top 3 no one else did. Not even City.

4263 2018-08-09 16:14:00 It’s all or nothing, why we buy oil from desert dwellers is beyond me? We can be self sufficient in so many ways, but the Fuckheads who run this country don’t want us to succeed. My livelihood was crushed by the NDP and Liberals, I now work for crumbs!!!

4271 2018-08-09 16:13:32 It's not that simple, if it was then we wouldn't be buying saudi oil. In fact cws is cheaper than brent and wti.
4272 2018-08-09 16:13:29 RBI neutral, oil soft (<80), currency holding below 69. Carry of ~ 4.5%. These drawing interest
4273 2018-08-09 16:13:28 At current oil prices our oil would sell at a loss in any market. I remember reading that we need oil to 75 a barrel for it to become profitable.
4274 2018-08-09 16:13:27 i'm not a mechanic 
personally i replace the airfilter every fall along with oil , oilfilter and fuelfilter even if i only drive 5 to 6000 km a year
4275 2018-08-09 16:13:11 Except at no point has export to China been the sole market for TMEP. That's false. It's one of many potential markets. Specifically that article says post 2025 India will take of the mantle of fastest growing oil consumption. The NEB decision in no way relies soley on China.

4277 2018-08-09 16:13:02 I giggle whenever someone talks smack about Texas, especially being 7generation Texan. Well guess what people, #trump et al are trying to turn American into one big Texas oil field

4279 2018-08-09 16:12:54 They’re hill people. In ‘27 of last century, Pa Little struck oil on land owned by moonshiner Davis Lexington. After a protracted feud, Mr Little won out, and now that family practically owns the whole county, and the 4th gen all have genital herpes. So you see my concern.
4280 2018-08-09 16:12:52 Do you think it's ever going to change?  Unless we can stop relying on the Saudis for Oil, the UK Govt will keep on being 'nice' to them :/
4281 2018-08-09 16:12:49 Do you know if higher oil prices benefit the company ?

4287 2018-08-09 16:11:47 It would appear though @sjmuir , that #Greenpeace and #Dogwood have similar funding models compared to #ResourceWorks , on the pro oil side of the argument. 

What’s the difference?
4288 2018-08-09 16:11:46 Repub gov has sold weapons to Ukraine, pushed Germany to stop buying Russian oil, bombed Russian backed Syria, closed a Russian embassy, sanctioned spies in retaliation to the first UK attack and now they are implementing more sanctions! Are you on crack?

4290 2018-08-09 16:11:35 or, in the interim, just buy the oil from somewhere else.....not sure why they get to decide if their human rights abuses impacts our desire to buy their oil.
4291 2018-08-09 16:11:29 there is no such thing as total corporate control, facts, in the past when corporates are too powerful the government breaks them up, for example, the Standard Oil Companies and AT&T, they are broken up by the government when a corporation is too big and monopoly the market.
4292 2018-08-09 16:11:17 Thing is, don’t even know if Dumb shit Trump knew

4294 2018-08-09 16:11:10 Energy East was an export pipeline

Are you going socialist on us? Are you going to command the movement of petroleum, build a public refinery?

Private enterprise doesn't have to buy Saudi oil. They could buy from Norway or here is an idea NFLD???
4295 2018-08-09 16:11:09 We have plenty of oil to where we don’t need Saudi oil. We support them because we view them as regional stabilizer who  to is home to the two holiest sites in Islam.

I think Saudi  government stinks to high heaven.
4296 2018-08-09 16:11:08 How ‘bout we stop buying Saudi oil @JustinTrudeau !

4302 2018-08-09 16:10:39 Clear skin? You have pimples? I never noticed. Ironically not washing your face with soap can help with pimples. Soap removes the natural oils from the face called the acid mantle. Bacteria cannot live on this oil. Look it up on youtube lots of success stories.

In 1975 Labour hid McCrone and stole your Oil. 
In 1999 Labour who moved North Sea lines, stole your oilfields. 
It was Lab/Blair who opened unfettered immigration leading to Brexit. Lab/Brown stole pensions and Gold. Wolves as friends

4317 2018-08-09 16:09:16 The bombing of a bus with innocent children clearly amounts to a war crime and genocide.Why are the international community silent,Is it because the Saudi terrorists have oil and money?The world is witnessing double standards.We lock up terrorists from Serbia
4318 2018-08-09 16:09:10 Why should it matter if they do shut oil off to Canada. We have our own oil right here in Alberta. Wake up Trudeau.Stop relying on other countries to feed our energy needs.
4319 2018-08-09 16:09:10 It is all about the OIL. Saudi has it everyone wants it therefore they all bow down to them and let them get by with anything or have anything. OIL talks everything else is just blah blah blah to the rest of the world
4320 2018-08-09 16:09:04 Not sure of yr point here. Agree. And that’s a good thing Just like fracking is a good thing. Without fracking, with Iran being squeezed and with Venezuela on the sidelines, the price of oil would be what ? Flirting with $100 and that would be a very bad thing for everyone.
4321 2018-08-09 16:08:57 Yeah, but ONE OF THEM HAS OIL!.

4345 2018-08-09 16:07:20 Finally, after so many years of burning midnight oil, receiving so many rejections, so many difficult moments, so many time i wanted to throw in the towel... It's you and the thought of so many LOVED ONES, i decided to press on :) — feeling wonderful
4346 2018-08-09 16:07:10 Oil field work?
4347 2018-08-09 16:07:09 Why we accept that ?  
He does not want our grain why would does one of their crappy oil ?
4348 2018-08-09 16:07:01 Is this the same Seth Church that has a business involved in the oil industry?  
4349 2018-08-09 16:06:57 Bio oil enaakkk. Skin aqua sunscreen yg spf 50 enak jugaa.
4350 2018-08-09 16:06:56 The main objective of the Space Force is to take the alien oil on Mars.
4351 2018-08-09 16:06:44 @YanaNiena nak tk cleansing oil ni ada org nak letgo haaa
4352 2018-08-09 16:06:13 god, i was playing hakan on an arcade machine last month and i was like "this character's fun, why did i quit?" until the first time i did jump back oil and got killed because it did 360k

i know you can avoid it by returning to neutral quickly but i'm already thinking too hard
4353 2018-08-09 16:06:08 And that’s some how the consumer fault? The car companies of the past 70 years are the ones who decided against innovating to a new fuel source till only recently because they like cheap oil and I feel like more people would choose electric options if they were more affordable.
4354 2018-08-09 16:05:58 Saudi Arabia has no respect for human beings and that's been obvious - they don't even respect their own women - it's all about phony religious ideology and the ruling class soaking up all the oil monies - US cozying up to them is pretty disgusting
4355 2018-08-09 16:05:52 Beard oil is the latest fad now

4358 2018-08-09 16:05:39 Hey guys, quick PSA: tea tree oil does the TRICK.
Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
4359 2018-08-09 16:05:36 全部ポジティブに捉えられる人間に作りかえられたい。
4360 2018-08-09 16:05:35 Trudeau has no problem paying billions for Saudi Oil. It's righteous crude, Alberta oil is evil can only cross Quebec by rail. Another cook up like Lac Megantic won't lose JT votes but oil in a pipe will. Saudi's r the no1 participant & $ of Sunni Arab terrorism against The West
4361 2018-08-09 16:05:31 I use chicken tenderloin, easier to grill.  It's just olive oil, lemon juice, season salt, pepper and Greek seasoning, marinated for 24 hours, then grill to perfection.
4362 2018-08-09 16:05:27 Kagak bakal bersih pake micellar water. Kudu yang oil base kayak minyak jelantah
4363 2018-08-09 16:05:18 Some Countries The Oil Is Used and Been Widely Raved About Regarding Pain Relief Big Pharma Might Want To Look Into It
4364 2018-08-09 16:05:17 I DONT NEED A MAN FOR ANYTHING (except to take my car to get an oil change for me bc this is scary)
4365 2018-08-09 16:05:16 He did go into Somalia(which is why he didn’t do anything in Rwanda) and later Bosnia. Oil is a tired and inaccurate reason people give for why the US takes military action. It’s more complicated than that.
4366 2018-08-09 16:05:12 I mean JFC before he worked for the notoriously truth-challenged oil and gas industry he worked for a right-wing political spin shop. This was not a "mistake" it's straight out of the same playbook that created Colorado Peak Politics fer chrissake.
4367 2018-08-09 16:05:09 Word! The cost of the equipment, the 3 loads of laundry I did after the show, the cleaning supplies I bought to get the glitter out of my bathroom, the day of cam I missed to clean it all up, the cost of glitter, oil, bubble bath, the hours of makeup prep and takedown. But ok.
4368 2018-08-09 16:05:07 Arms, Oil, Drugs, Children, Organs, and Greater Israel = Big $. #ThesePeopleAreSick
4369 2018-08-09 16:05:06 寝るス…明日は劇的にロングなバイトス…サークルで仲良い男友達のパクジミンか誰か遊びに来てス……
4370 2018-08-09 16:04:57 安心した！(笑)
正直意外だった大丈夫自分のできる難易度でやろう多分わいの隣だとﾋｴってなると思うのでmaimaiはしぃば間に挟むね（←ガン見させないスタイル）
4371 2018-08-09 16:04:53 เหงานะเเต่อยู่ได้
4372 2018-08-09 16:04:52 100,000 Council houses built between 1973 and 1977 in the midst of the first oil crisis. why is it so difficult now.
4373 2018-08-09 16:04:48 That's not fair, I think it's safe to say that every generation has done terrible things with their contemporary form of communication. 
We're just super efficient and can reach further. But doing stuff like spreading bad info and selling snake oil isn't a new thing.
4374 2018-08-09 16:04:34 My elbows get hot oil treatment and sprinkled wit Vietnamese Rock Salt aight?
4375 2018-08-09 16:04:34 Steak fries, and baked crinkle cuts are the exception, but mostly, no. Like 90% of the time, the oil and salt and over cooking stop good potato taste.
4376 2018-08-09 16:04:24 Eastern Canadian politicians killed the ‘Energy East’ pipeline for political nonsense reasons. Canadians should support Canadians. Let’s start with more pipelines to eastern refineries. We must not support foreign oil and humanitarian rights abusers.
4377 2018-08-09 16:04:18 金曜が祝日だったら、多分今頃同じことをやっていたはず……（血涙
4378 2018-08-09 16:04:18 Kylee came to my work and got my car, got me an oil change, ran my errands, and now is getting my car detailed. What a best friend 
4379 2018-08-09 16:04:10 Finally getting my oil changed
4380 2018-08-09 16:04:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i here?
4381 2018-08-09 16:04:05 Time to wait 3 hours for an oil change.
4382 2018-08-09 16:03:59 [food]

Me, spearing a piece of garlic that's marinated in garlic powder and garlic oil and then been dipped in garlic sauce: hmm, not enough garlic
4383 2018-08-09 16:03:58 US should push germany to cancel North Stream 2,and import more gas and oil from US. That should be a starter. Selling more oil and gas to Poland too,so we could transfer the gas to Ukraine using our network. Less coal dependent Ukr. from Russia supplied with gas. Just my 2 cents
4384 2018-08-09 16:03:53 2 cups flour (I get some of that pasta 00 stuff but I'm probably being scammed), 2/3 cup water, sachet of yeast (7g i think), some sugar to feed yeast, pinch of salt, tbsp of olive oil and some spices

and yeah I knead and ferment myself, I usually don't ferment that long tho
4385 2018-08-09 16:03:28 And, finally, every GOP voter is figuratively and literally "starting to sweat" because he or she is quickly realizing that the GOP's COLLUSION with the Oil & Gas Industry is just making GLOBAL WARMING FAR WORSE and voting them out is the ONLY SOLUTION or impetus to CHANGE COURSE
4386 2018-08-09 16:03:10 ปุ่นบั้มแรกเท่าไหร่หรอคะ
4387 2018-08-09 16:02:59 こら～はやくしになさ～い
4388 2018-08-09 16:02:59 i have to get an oil change in my car but i really don't wanna put pants on, or leave my house...
4389 2018-08-09 16:02:58 My co-worker is burning essential oil and it’s actually giving me a headache. 
4390 2018-08-09 16:02:58 Oil war YAYY....at least the media won’t blame the US

Wait or course they will
4391 2018-08-09 16:02:54 We suggest a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip,  drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip,  drip, drip, drip, drip, drip of oil.
4392 2018-08-09 16:02:43 Na I deh in this Oil & Gas training. No AC 
4393 2018-08-09 16:02:38 To be clear Trudeau is happy to sell armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia and is also happy the Irving family profits from selling dirty oil Saudi Oil but yes, Trudeau got 'tough' and sent out a few tweets that cost Canada billions in revenue and did NOTHING to help Saudi activists.
4394 2018-08-09 16:02:36 Well lets transition out of Saudi oil and bring in Western Canadian Select oil and deprive them of $300M per month
4395 2018-08-09 16:02:22 Yeah but oil free! NO OIL!
4396 2018-08-09 16:02:21 Ah, very good.

So what was your timing like?

Did you switch to this diet, and the GB issues sort of faded away, is that about right?

Olive oil will act as a trigger for bile release (coconut oil, too, and meat fats work even better). The fibers in the veggies then act as a mop
4397 2018-08-09 16:02:16 What the hell is wrong with these people? How can less pollution be a bad thing, regardless of whether or not you believe in global warming? AND if US oil production is up by $2m barrels a day, why the hell are gas prices so high? America is headed to the shitter. 
4398 2018-08-09 16:02:08 Unless oil is discovered
4399 2018-08-09 16:02:07 What is the problem of high-oleic canola oil?
4400 2018-08-09 16:02:06 Nope but they said if they catch me bullying him again I'll be fired so I'm the problem obviously if he falls into the hot oil or a moving blade I'm not cleaning up his blood. Honestly I'm so frustrated I might get a new job or transfer departments.
4401 2018-08-09 16:01:55 No That's not how any of this works. If big bad gubmint wanted a carbon tax we'd have one. But we probably never will, bc govt. is owned by oil and gas companies.
4402 2018-08-09 16:01:24 Must be the way the Shellac is reacting to the varnish, maybe the oil or water primer might fair better?    Never been asked to do kitchen units other than my own.
4403 2018-08-09 16:01:22 Which is why they picked up Lucas Oil. Weirdly, my experiences with spaces at the Con was much better than yours this year. Even at the Paizo booth, which was really easy to navigate the times I passed by it.
4404 2018-08-09 16:01:22 Nice clothes and a velvet oratory do not make you dignified or learned. Snake oil salesman comes to mind
4405 2018-08-09 16:00:59 Ahahahaha yeah and I bet Bucky named a rowdy goat after Sam just to annoy him.  

Yasss and then slather it with some Wakandan oil 
4406 2018-08-09 16:00:58 We cannot process the bitumen/Dilbit that is why Alberta sells it to the US and we buy it back after it is refined.  We need that SA oil in Nova Scotia.  Until pipelines and refineries are in place, where do you think the oil will come from?
4407 2018-08-09 16:00:55 @MarcIles do you reckon we should start drilling to see if the Oil reserves recently discovered under the DW stretch as far as the UNIBOL Marc?
4408 2018-08-09 16:00:55 Chris, shut up  Coconut oil is the shizniz
4409 2018-08-09 16:00:46 Whip together 2 quarts Rice with 2 cups bacon. Mix in Olive Oil. Fry. Serve warm.
4410 2018-08-09 16:00:42 Anything think it could be big oil that gets Tesla? Doesn’t a company like Exxon have the cash? $xom $tsla
4411 2018-08-09 16:00:41 Agreed. The record short positioning has persisted for a long time. Inflation peaking, global growth peaked, US growth peaking, look at oil, etc
4412 2018-08-09 16:00:37 As opposed to the huge subsidies paid to oil and gas companies? Like I said I won't need a new battery. Governments use subsidies to enable early adoption of new technologies which will in time come down in price with economies of scale.
4413 2018-08-09 16:00:34 Olive oil really does smell bad.
4414 2018-08-09 16:00:34 BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.

4418 2018-08-09 16:00:18 #NowPlaying Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @216ClevRadio
4419 2018-08-09 16:00:16 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4420 2018-08-09 16:00:11 Lmao gotta get my oil and shit changed
4421 2018-08-09 16:00:06 ぐへえ
4422 2018-08-09 16:00:06 Respectfully disagree. Oil sands not as enviro friendly as other extraction methods. Need to rebrand along with implementation of new processes. Address bitumen issue directly.
4423 2018-08-09 15:59:58 Good. Let's do that, then. After that, we apparently need to wash your hair with dish soap, which is bad for hair but necessary to get out the oil, and then we have to wash it again with normal shampoo. 
Sounds like fun.
4424 2018-08-09 15:59:57 Gee, how we gonna pay for all these wars and tax cuts for the rich and money to apartheid Israel and Saudi Arabia and overthrowing democracies all over the world and massive subsidies for oil companies, said no one, ever.
4425 2018-08-09 15:59:38 体調悪いので寝るか
4426 2018-08-09 15:59:38 U can never benefit from the oil if u don’t glorify that oil..wisdom from @Blakkrasta, more
4427 2018-08-09 15:59:31 You are exactly right! I was furious with her on Big Brother saying crap about him.  But she is ALL ABOUT HERSELF!!  She is very conceded and arrogant.  She is a narcissist and wants fame, Glory, and riches.  I believe she would turn on her own to get it.  
4428 2018-08-09 15:59:24 I say leave these guys in the dust Canada! Fire up the oil sands, who needs Saudi Arabia anyway! Like full Diva mode over a tweet? What a disgrace their Prince is 
4429 2018-08-09 15:59:23 The latter is more cynical.  A bit like Shell or BP claiming they are doing sustainable energy development, when what they are doing is trying to sabotage these new technologies from the inside! It does NOT benefit the Saudi (or any oil producing) sovereign fund to undermine oil.
4430 2018-08-09 15:59:17 Wow.. Wow
Come I'd massage you, you ll massage me. I have oil, I have food, I have alcohol, I have rabbit meat and kpomo too
4431 2018-08-09 15:59:11 Ok face oil and moisturizing lip balm makes me a flawless creature wtf
4432 2018-08-09 15:59:08 So I’m getting an oil change and the lady said pop the hood and then I push the parking break... how do i constantly embarrass myself 
4433 2018-08-09 15:59:01 If we had strong leadership Canada would have already announced that no further shipments of Saudi oil would be allowed into our ports. Of course if we had strong leadership certain pipe lines and refineries would already be built. The  fact we need any foreign oil is sickening
4434 2018-08-09 15:58:58 BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.

4435 2018-08-09 15:58:57 Too much oil 
4436 2018-08-09 15:58:55 rice oil
4437 2018-08-09 15:58:54 When is oil going to pay back its subsidies? When are farmers going to pay back their tax breaks? Your point is lame and ignorant. Regardless of who pays for the electricity, there are@charges on it. In many cases, destination chargers services are payed for by the by the owner.
4438 2018-08-09 15:58:38 USA imposes sanctions on Russia this week. 
Russia may stop exporting oil to usa in separate trade law from 1991. 
If Iran and Russia stop exporting to USA. Does dollar weaken or strenthen. Does Oil rise or fall. Is Exxon Mobil monday going up or down on Earnings.
4439 2018-08-09 15:58:34 Maybe it's the right time to actually start processing and refining CDN oil right here and take Saudi Arabia and OPEC out of equation.
4440 2018-08-09 15:58:31 Western Canada Select is not your average oil. That's why the enviros are lobbying against it because it takes more processing to turn it into gasoline, diesel, av gas, etc. That's why we ship it to Texas refineries b/c they already refine Venezuelan oil, similar to WCS
4441 2018-08-09 15:58:22 Like all cults people won’t leave until the pain of staying is more than the pain of leaving.  Those leaving just think about how Musk may have tried to sell you out to The “big oil” Saudies. Might help your way out as you sell your Sept 380 calls
4442 2018-08-09 15:58:16 If it’s anything like Armageddon with Bruce Willis and his crew of oil riggers trying to save us from an asteroid then I’m all for it.
4443 2018-08-09 15:57:56 ありがとう！！！！
4444 2018-08-09 15:57:52 Bound enough for Zetas to bail their org out financially. Could u imagine the bruhs like Ey sorors what that Coleman love like- loan us a couple million. The shade would be epic. Every time we made oil the Redz would be like y’all need to put that oil down and pay us back 
4445 2018-08-09 15:57:49 可愛いミスだこと笑笑
4446 2018-08-09 15:57:44 Food for thought , America: maybe the world doesn’t need America as much as before. We don’t have a lock on soybeans, oil and increasingly, hi tech. That’s what negotiations and contracts are for until Hurricane Trump screwed everything up
4447 2018-08-09 15:57:43 Because #PMSocks, and his #ButtsWiper shut down the energy east pipeline to make our East Coast dependent on middle east  oil. Construct the Energy East Pipeline, and we're 100% self sustaining and we won't need conflict oil

4450 2018-08-09 15:57:23 All countries should stop accepting Saudi oil. The Saudis hate the western world anyway. They just love our money that made a select few of them rich.
4451 2018-08-09 15:57:00 But I could've thought about what was going to happen before I told you to go take a shower. 

Alright, according to the internet, the first thing we need to do is putting oil in your hair and massage it in until the flour looses its stickiness.
4452 2018-08-09 15:56:57 I really like creamy baby oil as a moisturizer, look in the infant aisle though
4453 2018-08-09 15:56:43 Just started using it a few days for a major case of sunburn from vacation but it’s only an astringent and calms inflammation so I combined it with Jamaican black castor oil. It’s all good!!
4454 2018-08-09 15:56:41 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.

4455 2018-08-09 15:56:31 The guy changing my oil said that my car looked like me? Should I be flattered? That I look like a Jeep?
4456 2018-08-09 15:56:28 This was an anonymous, unreliable, one-sided attack on journalism, yes, and an attempt by big oil to initimidate invididual journalists. This is not at attempt by poor, resourceless oil  to set the record straight. They’ve got much more effective means than that.

4460 2018-08-09 15:56:13 Canada should make sure it does impact Canada-Saudi Aramco relations by building Energy East and supplying Quebec/East Coast refineries from Alberta/Sask. It's bullshit that oil is being imported while we give away our own oil

4467 2018-08-09 15:55:20 Hm, eigentlich ist es viel subtiler. Es geht nicht nur einfach um Geld sondern um Rohstoffe, die uns zu unseren Konditionen abgegeben werden sollen. Z.B. Oil. Ist die Regierung nicht ProWestlich, wird ein Putsch angezettelt um eine ProWestliche Regierung an die Macht zu heben.
4468 2018-08-09 15:55:16 Great but how much leverage did Russia have exactly over canada? We import Saudi oil out of necessity and just made a giant deal to sell military equipment, don't recall that with China. Terrible comparison, not to mention the global community was on par condemning Russia at time
4469 2018-08-09 15:55:14 I always lived with this idea of America with the knowledge that evil is always bubbling just beneth the surface, like an oil seepage pond. Heading for a geyser now!
4470 2018-08-09 15:55:02 Olive Oil
4471 2018-08-09 15:54:53 ....huge shock to the economy with the huge reduction in oil use. I wohkf assume that governments and oil companies are pushing the auto industry to restrict supply and wean is off oil slowly.
4472 2018-08-09 15:54:51    Extra virgin olive oil is, without a doubt, one of the best foods to take care of the good health of your veins, arteries and capillaries. #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #oliveoil #huiledolive 
4473 2018-08-09 15:54:50 What if there was an existing pipeline that could be reversed to deliver Canadian oil to the east coast?  Would that work? The depth of incompetence of this government is staggering.
4474 2018-08-09 15:54:47 Argan oil van kruidvat mss?
4475 2018-08-09 15:54:44 Make her talk about her past and she will heal up................ About the wetness u can always use oil

4478 2018-08-09 15:54:12 Since when did the US care more about human rights than money and oil? lol
4479 2018-08-09 15:54:10 Hey @JustinTrudeau!  Why you not stopping the oil shipments from Saudi Arabia after they just targeted all other economic sanctions on Canada??? What?  Canadian oil ain't good enough for ya!  WAKE UP!!!
4480 2018-08-09 15:54:07 National Post had a good write up on Saudi oil and Irving Oil.
4481 2018-08-09 15:54:05 I have to find something to wear tonight, go get my eyebrows done, get an oil change, and get gas all before 2 o’clock 
4482 2018-08-09 15:54:01 At the place I get my oil changed:
@baileylittle01 *takes drink of root beer, whispers in my ear* “when you take a drink this does it smell like tires?”
4483 2018-08-09 15:53:59 But drama teacher will gladly take their oil to continue liberals virtue signalling
4484 2018-08-09 15:53:57 #SaudiArabia claims it cut #oil production in July. But US Gov’t & independent agencies report it boosted production ~
S Said @WSJ
4485 2018-08-09 15:53:55 He's all about giving Putin & Saudi Arabia high crude oil prices so Russian & Saudi kleptocrats make tons of money..

Of which he's probably getting a cut..
4486 2018-08-09 15:53:37 got a turmeric coconut oil sugar lip scrub in the cards i think
4487 2018-08-09 15:53:37 My mom use to slice them in half, brush with olive oil, salt it, then broil them in a little toaster oven. They were awesome!
4488 2018-08-09 15:53:21 Lots of oil workers are going to be screwed along with us
4489 2018-08-09 15:53:13 personally offended as I just ran out of coconut oil THIS MORNING and am just a dull brown today. how dare you sir.

4491 2018-08-09 15:52:46 Mannn... this guy probably thinks Cassius Clay changed his name to impress Saudi Arabian oil moguls
4492 2018-08-09 15:52:45 Closing prices: #Ftse100 -0.45% #DAX 0.34% #CAC 0.01% #Estoxx50 -0.03% #GBPUSD 1.2868 #EURGBP 0.899 #Gold 0.07% #Oil -0.00%
4493 2018-08-09 15:52:43 Not only that, but we’ll have the agony of falling behind the Scouers too and can’t use the “oil wells” excuse for that.
4494 2018-08-09 15:52:40 Finally! And what's this about aid? Mexico's natural resources include silver, oil, copper and agricultural crops. They are the largest oil producers in the world and the third largest producer in the Americas. It also has the fourth largest shale gas deposits on the planet!
4495 2018-08-09 15:52:38 The steels are RWL 34 and PMC 27 stainless steels. They must be welded together in an oxygen free environment. To heat treat you take it up to 1500 ° for 7 min then quench in oil that is 75°, into the freezer for 24 hrs then the oven at 180°
4496 2018-08-09 15:52:38 Bushra. I dont know if you can find jojoba oil in pakistan. But if you can thats the best natural remedy to dandruff because jojoba oil has same properties as the oil produced by our scalp.
4497 2018-08-09 15:52:33 One thing to do is get rid of all of your nuclear reactors plants. Second give One Billion in cash back to the U.S.A. so we can get our tax money back to the Americans that Obama promise us.Third Americans have control over your gas and oil who can buy it.
4498 2018-08-09 15:52:15 Settling into our hotel for #nineworlds . I'm not sure if I just haven't stayed in a lot of nice hotels, but our room has avocado oil soap and a Nespresso. Is that... normal?

4503 2018-08-09 15:51:37 Maybe Canada should look towards other sources of light oil Maybe we should look at Alberta light crude. If only Energy East was a fact.
4504 2018-08-09 15:51:28 My favorite nonfiction book is Thicker Than Oil, which goes into this subject in great detail.
4505 2018-08-09 15:51:26 Wonder what you would be saying if you had no gas for your car?  Canada had better get the structures in place to use Alberta bitumen before we cut off Saudi oil.
4506 2018-08-09 15:51:17 The problem is, Jason, that the Harper gov't was never interested in building independence which is why Harper made oil & arms agreements with KSA in the 1st place. His idea was to ship Canada's oil to the US. Even the US is trying to wean itself off foreign resources.
4507 2018-08-09 15:51:02 We found space oil that needs to be space liberated!
4508 2018-08-09 15:50:57 Can you elaborate? I've read that there's a symbiosis between the US dollar and Saudi oil, but have never understood it.
4509 2018-08-09 15:50:54 $HIPH LALPINA Hydro CBD allows for greater bio availability which leads to a greater & quicker absorption rate compared to regular CBD oil or CBD water.
4510 2018-08-09 15:50:40 Guys at the repair shop, changing the oil, audibly shitting on my adorable scrap box and expecting me to cheer them on. 

I mean, what they're saying is true, but I'm still picturing them squirming as I pour hot, used motor oil down their throats.
4511 2018-08-09 15:50:33 @francoislegault Quebec could save $3 billion. Quebec and Atlantic Canada spent 17 billion importing oil from the USA, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. @BlanchardSL #yyc
4512 2018-08-09 15:50:30 Was that some oil of 'mek nuff money'
4513 2018-08-09 15:50:30 At an oil change watching The View, not my choice. 100 year old woman had run & finished some marathon.  Where I'm pet sitting & watch tv, the elliptical and treadmill are directly under me and I'm too lazy to use them. Not Now! 
4514 2018-08-09 15:50:14 I used to use wound wash or a saline solution for infection & tea tree oil for irritation.
4515 2018-08-09 15:50:03 Yes, as well as Brown helping to insure that drilling for oil (inland as well as offshore) and fracking are permanently discontinued in our state!
4516 2018-08-09 15:50:03 Nothing more than a #greasemonkey. Managed to figure out my headlight, now to make sure the oil gets change soon. That is something I will allow the professionals to do. #womancandoittoo
4517 2018-08-09 15:49:55 Bitch to work on too... overheated and smelled like oil all the time. Yep. That's the Ford Econoline. Had a 67 Greenbriar for a while too.
4518 2018-08-09 15:49:53 I have heard so many arguments that start off with Obama did it first...makes it sound like if Obama did it the person supports it.  No more death for oil, no matter who did what when. Stop now.
4519 2018-08-09 15:49:51 I was hit by the sapsucker. Thank God for discernment!  It was a red one coming for my oil.
4520 2018-08-09 15:49:44 Almond Oil.
4521 2018-08-09 15:49:43 Lmao! I heard you are in Oil money now. Are you sure I can still come?
4522 2018-08-09 15:49:38 Oil cops should be in jail not a serup by a snitch
4523 2018-08-09 15:49:27 Bio oil, skin aqua, acnol. Plisssss work di aku yaaaaahhhh 
4524 2018-08-09 15:49:24 We should cancel all military deals with them... they use the APCs we sell them to attack defenceless people anyway... plus we have the oil here, why not make the steps necessary to be self sufficient?
4525 2018-08-09 15:49:23 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
4526 2018-08-09 15:49:18 Saudis shld know they depend 90% on oil revenue,Canada,3%,we can play hardball,we too nice and we ignore kids.Picking a fight with us,wats wrong with u.Just cut it out!!!

4529 2018-08-09 15:48:41 @Dodge just got a brand new engine put in at 40k miles, 10k miles later and it is still eating oil  so thanks for the continuous hassle that is your fucking Dodge Dart.
4530 2018-08-09 15:48:40 Haha mine is pretty healthy, I just straighten it, but it's the oil that gets me. So finding a nice/affordable shampoo for oily but a bit damaged hair seems rare.
4531 2018-08-09 15:48:38 He had his way our forestry would be replaced by golf & hotels & oil fields
4532 2018-08-09 15:48:17 Gotta get that oil changed this weekend.. I need to come get your truck anyway  RT @DetNigga: @Consistent__D What you need done??
4533 2018-08-09 15:48:12 RANDOM SENIOR MUSING:  KSA bans importing  our barley but will generously continue to sell us their oil.  Where did they learn their negotiating tactics – Trump University?
4534 2018-08-09 15:48:11 how can you eliminate money? people will trade gold coins or oil barrels etc.  if there is no state then you can’t enforce a ban on money or private property

4536 2018-08-09 15:48:03 There's a bad joke about extra virgin olive oil here that i'll let somebody else make
4537 2018-08-09 15:48:02 Oil changes take so fucking long
4538 2018-08-09 15:48:00 Just as well. I'd rather give my money to a nation that doesn't jail people for dancing or posthumously crucifies people. 

They're still buying our infantry fighting vehicles for 15B & still selling us oil. What's their other export? Terrorism? They can keep it.

#Fuck'em
4539 2018-08-09 15:47:56 Maybe they should be! Why wouldn't our Goverment halt all oil purchases in Protest and reinvest that money back into Canadian produced product.
4540 2018-08-09 15:47:55 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
4541 2018-08-09 15:47:51 Oil is refined into 14 different products.  We refined oil into petrol in Montreal, Saudi oil.  You're suggesting to build 14 refineries and 14 pipelines ?  With government money ? Taxpayers money ?  That's why we pay the most for cell phones in the world,  that thinking.
4542 2018-08-09 15:47:49 Naaaa....Shark liver oil! Very dear!
4543 2018-08-09 15:47:45 Olive oil. I’m curious if you’re considering other flavors...? 
4544 2018-08-09 15:47:44 Oh totally. And then I had the audacity to be mad at the cbd oil

4550 2018-08-09 15:47:23 Whenever I see "College is broken! we need to replace it!" I feel like it's like they're saying "My Cadillac  past due for an oil change and I need new tires, but I can't afford them and I'd rather have a pickup truck, so I'm going to trade it in for a Ford Fiesta."

4555 2018-08-09 15:46:36 Until the oil runs out then you will be cast aside. Enjoy it while it lasts, your oil is the only reason you even exist.
4556 2018-08-09 15:46:31 @HollysWOOD10 I just got an oil change. Aren’t you proud?

4565 2018-08-09 15:45:51 How bout the fact that oil is going no where. It provides a quality of life that will not be relinquished.

Beyond hypocritical.
4566 2018-08-09 15:45:30 I’m listening to a podcast and the topic is lubricant. People once used olive oil and crisco as lube. And, apparently, some still use vaseline. 

God. No. Just….I’m so glad water and silicon lube exists now. Of all things CRISCO. 
4567 2018-08-09 15:45:30 $CL_F break below 66.31 would expose 66.04 - 65.61 as next short-term area of interest #Oil #Elliottwave
4568 2018-08-09 15:45:16 Alright bankers and oil companies. I can see that the national and global economic system is set up to make you rich while bankrupting governments. Intentional? Or just greed? If you're in control of governments, then we have a big problem here. Either way, your game must end now
4569 2018-08-09 15:45:07 Seth Church says pro #1 outside groups are spending millions.  Stand For Alaska has spent 9 mill and counting and has money to pay for this twitter ad.

4582 2018-08-09 15:44:21 Is oil going higher? china tarrifs on usa oil. iran sanctions. russia curbing exports to usa. yes, oil is going lower first out of trade fear then higher out of real numbers hitting reality. the pendulum is going to be a traders dream. its swinging now
4583 2018-08-09 15:44:21 Same can be said for Canada, our principles cannot be allowed to interfere with buying Saudi oil. If JT were serious about this (or anything for that matter) he would ban the importation of Saudi oil immediately. Oh, wait he has made sure we do not have a domestic supply. #oopps
4584 2018-08-09 15:44:16 He shouldn't be allowed to sell any oil and wealthy Americans should not be allowed to adopt his children.
4585 2018-08-09 15:44:15 What was the name of the nation the Bin Laden came from? And almost all of the 9/11 hijackers? Yeah, not Iran. Saudi. But they have oil so it’s okay.
4586 2018-08-09 15:44:13 If the Israelis’ “evil” plan is getting rid of the corrupt regime of Mullahs who  killed tens of thousands of Its own people and used billions of oil dollars  to make a hell out of its neighboring countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen, then let the evil work!

4591 2018-08-09 15:43:45 Good morning! Sorry I haven't been active this morning. I had a dream I didnt have time to get my oil changed before work so I went as soon as I woke up

4596 2018-08-09 15:42:58 It is not a slight towards any political party to admit that Canada needs to rethink long and hard about our overarching geopolitical strategy 

Selling oil to a single customer (U.S.) and “exporting values” is not a sufficient foreign policy in these turbulent times #cdnpoli
4597 2018-08-09 15:42:57 Do you have any economic solutions as to how we would pay for the clean water without out the tax dollars from the oil?

4599 2018-08-09 15:42:53 $CHK it won’t move unless oil moves
4600 2018-08-09 15:42:50 The sanctions have seriously altered taxation for the sector, production outlooks, forced oil companies into the Middle East, etc. They weren't designed to reduce European dependence but alter Russian policy considerations. They've done so, but in less visible ways.
4601 2018-08-09 15:42:46 If Canadians weren't so stupid we'd use our own oil.  We'd build energy East and pipe it in from Alberta instead of selling it to Americana at a discount.  We have Trudeau and a liberal government, lose lose.  Nice going dipshits.

4608 2018-08-09 15:42:08 Keep burning our Saudi and Venezuelan oil than? The chemistry is still evolving and using less Cobalt for every new variation. Model 3 for instance uses 30% that of the Model S equivalent. Also, big investments in NL mine where Canada mines Cobalt, funny nobody mentions this...
4609 2018-08-09 15:42:04 Why have foreign language as an elective then?

They recieve the same education.

They don't pay appropriate special ed needs.
Are you against them too?

4622 2018-08-09 15:41:11 It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. More and more of our imports are coming from overseas.
4623 2018-08-09 15:41:05 Gov should use his as a lesson and begin to become less dependent on Saudi oil.
4624 2018-08-09 15:41:02 Ethical Oil NOW!
4625 2018-08-09 15:40:55 Right. I'd say, sure, there is a "global" ruling class, yet there remains a distinct US one shaping US fp,, esp US corporations -- arms manufacturers, oil companies, etc. At any rate, the case you're pointing to isn't the one the "foreign influence" journey are making.
4626 2018-08-09 15:40:54 Yea, they need the money not the aggravation. We should stop buying Saudi Oil. Hit them where it hurts
4627 2018-08-09 15:40:48 Going to get an oil change and they telling me everything that's wrong with my car like hoe I know I turn the radio up give me an oil change
4628 2018-08-09 15:40:48 "We don't like you, but please, continue buy our oil." Drama queens.
4629 2018-08-09 15:40:45 Does Canada really need their oil?
4630 2018-08-09 15:40:42 You have to ban all natural gas and oil cars.  Tell people to only drive when need to
4631 2018-08-09 15:40:31 A new round of sanctions that could come into force in three months could put an end to Russian crude oil and oil product exports to the United States, S&P Platts reports, citing a 1991 law treating the imports of national security-sensitive goods, including crude oil,
4632 2018-08-09 15:40:30 If you’re having a bad day just be happy you didn’t break a $25 bottle of olive oil and have it spill all over your kitchen :)
4633 2018-08-09 15:40:23 Too the American political elites, countries with a lot of oil cannot be called bad, no matter how much evil they cause in the world.
4634 2018-08-09 15:40:22 okay.. please keep chacha in your thoughts. it's bad that she ingested the vegetable oil. they're giving her treatment but the vet said it's a possibility she won't make it.
4635 2018-08-09 15:40:21 Saudi said they will still sell us oil and you know Trudeau will not stop refineries buying from any of these countries with human rights issues

4647 2018-08-09 15:39:24 I’m at Mazda getting my car serviced, and they sent me a live video of them changing my oil, checking my tires, etc. That’s some dang good customer service. 
4648 2018-08-09 15:39:22 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

4651 2018-08-09 15:39:11 Okay, I made this up, so...:) First, I sautéed lots of onions in olive oil, then threw in garlic powder & ginger powder, some red pepper, then the chopped washed kale. I poured about a half-ish can of coconut milk & sprinkled in salt to taste. Simmered until kale was tender.

4670 2018-08-09 15:37:02 In other words, you don't want us to cut off our oil supply from Saudi Arabia. Thank you for that. But, Canada, too, has a "firm and long-standing policy" to speak up for human rights and against abuses of same. We don't force you to respond, we just hope you will listen.

4676 2018-08-09 15:36:15 It’s interesting that, when we fight oil and gas in our hometown of Broomfield, we are called “outside environmentalists”. Yet, they ship the resources out of Broomfield and Colorado. Hypocrisy much? @Extraction_OG @ColoradoRising @GovofCO @broomfield
4677 2018-08-09 15:36:06 The real threat is the influence that they have over countries dependent on their oil and ISIS of course.
4678 2018-08-09 15:35:42 Canada has its own oil. Build pipelines. Build a refinery, use our own oil and then sell the excess.

4683 2018-08-09 15:35:03 Take Rockefeller as an example. He got wealthier than can be imagined by refining oil into kerosene. But the price of kerosene dropped nearly 90% in 20-30 years, which allowed even the lower classes to afford some light after the sun set. This happened across all industries.
4684 2018-08-09 15:35:00 News are coming from sources that oil seeker company found million of billion worth oil in Baluchistan but still this information is not verified as I said. If this is true we can imagine

4687 2018-08-09 15:34:53 @OilandEnergy  Thank the Saudi's for our new pipeline East because It is in Canadas national interest not to be taken economically hostage by Saudi Oil.
4688 2018-08-09 15:34:52 Saudi Arabia is a ball of hot wax & hard to handle. Their only edge is that thy have oil & huge sums of cash/investments from way back. A single country like Canada can't stand up to them & that is why we need all countries to do it together.
4689 2018-08-09 15:34:50 I don't even know why I'm upset. As if i actually expected us to do a madness this summer. Levy is a snake oil salesman, Poch and the players are now having to compete with 19 other teams who've improved drastically. And now we'd be lucky to even make europa league next season.
4690 2018-08-09 15:34:47 This makes zero sense. Why is Canada taking oil shipments from Saudi Arabia? It’s time Canada become a little more independent & use some of those billions of land locked crude in Alberta to supply the rest of Canada. May be even think about building a new oil refinery too.
4691 2018-08-09 15:34:39 Bernie, we know who you are working for and it is not for the American people...You are a has been, a corrupt snake oil salesman and a liar. Go back to the pit from which you came.
4692 2018-08-09 15:34:39 Today, KSA announced that their oil trade with Canada will not be affected because they know it will affect them more. Canada is right to stand for those two prisoners in KSA.

4696 2018-08-09 15:34:20 No more Saudi Oil for Canada. Build the Energy East pipeline and let the barbarians rot. Our GDP is over 3 Trillion. Saudi is 600 Billion. Who needs who?

4699 2018-08-09 15:34:02 Im allergic (they cook everything in peanut oil) so I've never tried it, but they take discrimination to new level so am not upset I cant eat it.
4700 2018-08-09 15:33:45 How we were just treated was caused by how our government treated them by not being diplomatic. That aside, they don’t have an endless supply of oil. Better to use up their reserves as long as we have some sort of backup plan (pipelines) in case either side cuts off supply.
4701 2018-08-09 15:33:36 This idea that stagflation was "impossible" is a fallacy. If you have quadrupling oil prices, strong unions demanding high wages, Barber Budgets, lax monetary policy, and expectations that the Gov will sustain employment, Keynes would expect it!
4702 2018-08-09 15:33:34 The Saudis are so full of shit. They pretend to act tough but when push comes to shove they will still sell us oil. They need us more than we need them and they know it.
4703 2018-08-09 15:33:28 We're on the same page mate, i'm not mad at Barca. Just be ware. After (once) great clubs like Ajax or AC Milan it looks like Barca could be next. Football is losing, oil and money is winning and that's no good

4715 2018-08-09 15:31:26 Did you know that oil and latex exterior paints require different amounts of time to dry? Latex requires 2-3 hours before it's dry to the touch and 4-5 hours until it's safe for a second coat. Oil paint normally takes about 4 hours until it's dry and 24 hours before it's ready...
4716 2018-08-09 15:31:21 Why are we not banning their oil? @JustinTrudeau
4717 2018-08-09 15:31:20 Some of us are allergic to their food because they cook it in peanut oil.

4720 2018-08-09 15:30:56 In short term, apply rosewater thrice a day, apply almond oil mixed go to moisturizer before you go to bed. Apply starch or potato water with cotton swabs. Apply black tea (without sugar ) with swabs.

4722 2018-08-09 15:30:53 The Saudi's are taking all their money out of Canada AND getting to keep their oil revenues from CDN taxpayers. It's a win win for them & a lose lose for us. The least the PM could do is shut off their oil & keep the revenue in Canada. Don't you think?

4731 2018-08-09 15:30:25 When Trump placed tariffs on steel and alum excuse was national security (ie: too much reliance on foreign product req'd national def). We squealed but the premise has some merit. Here we sit with an abundance of oil yet our eastern provinces are reliant on foreign oil. Huh?

Money, money, money.
4734 2018-08-09 15:30:11 Europe has a great need for oil but they will-reportedly  react soon, the issue is still the reaction both by the saudis and trump is unprecedented and it seems to be based on trying to shut up Trudeau and his foreign affairs minister

4738 2018-08-09 15:29:52 When you use cholestyramine or foods with cholestyramine like ability (black beans are pretty good; see Google Scholar for more), you gradually remove old, toxicant laden bile. 

Using the car analogy, it’s getting an oil change — although gradually, over time.
4739 2018-08-09 15:29:40 I agree. So few orangutan remain in the wild, yet their country does nothing to protect their habitat because palm oil is so lucrative. It's heartbreaking.

4745 2018-08-09 15:29:10 Well of course Crown Prince wouldn’t want to hurt his profit margin. Stop buying their oil after you get our people out of Saudi
4746 2018-08-09 15:29:10 In less than a day I’ll be on my way to Lucas Oil Stadium to see DCI Semis and Finals and I honestly can’t believe it. It’s a dream come true.
4747 2018-08-09 15:29:03 I've yet to see anybody tackle what it's actually about, which is the futility of war over competition for scarce resources making it near impossible to stay true to your moral compass, as a pre-allegory for the inevitable oil and water wars of the late 21st century

4749 2018-08-09 15:28:56 We import over 10 million barrels of oil per day, but we also export oil? Is it a less desirable grade of oil?
4750 2018-08-09 15:28:54 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

*Gets oiliness under control* Remember how much you hated the desert? That's your face now.

4754 2018-08-09 15:28:37 Baby oil literally saves lives.
4755 2018-08-09 15:28:36 key differences: 
1-you cant fork oil! 
2-Oil don´t have the potencial to act as a instrument to make international trade fairer and even increase stability on world politics.

4758 2018-08-09 15:28:30 Bile recirculates continuously, like motor oil. Unlike cars, though, we have no drain. We depend on certain foods to bind old bile and remove it.

There’s a resin you can get doctors that has an extreme binding factor. Cholestyramine. Upsher-Smith makes the safest versions
4759 2018-08-09 15:28:24 In a fictional story that had no bearing on reality?
Do you think that private industries haven’t considered turning all our raw oil, wood, minerals, grain, and other agri products into finished goods? 

It’s more complicated than a Tweet.

4762 2018-08-09 15:28:14 I thought Canada had its own massive oil fields.
Isnt the USA supplied by canadian oil???
I didnt know that even Canada bought oil from saudis.
4763 2018-08-09 15:28:13 the problem is that Canada gives lessons after gaining energy and oil independence by inducing an geant ecological disaster with the tar sands

4773 2018-08-09 15:27:02 That would require greater reliance on oil from Alberta... Trudeau cannot have that. Other countries must look at Canada and wonder in amazement for all the wrong reasons. It has everything but still manages to screw it up.
4774 2018-08-09 15:26:57 Olive oil works like a charm!
4775 2018-08-09 15:26:56 Big oil knew about the continued use of fossil fuels on the eco-system yet decided to hide it from the public. Now we are witnessing climate challenges caused by the greatest industry assault in human history. And no one has been put in jail.

4794 2018-08-09 15:25:29 Well good old Saudi Arabia gets away with murder but the US and UK bend over backward to please them and look the other way when it comes to their appalling human rights but they had to create an enemy and an enemy with oil and other precious resources so  have their eye on Iran!
4795 2018-08-09 15:25:15 It's a really good dupe for Cliniques cleansing balm. With it being oil based you don't feel like you're dragging against your eyes.

Roasted cauliflower and potato soup topped with almond romesco and smoked olive oil.
4801 2018-08-09 15:24:56 Interesting! I do have a history of gall bladder issues, but it’s calm as long as I consume lots of olive oil.
4802 2018-08-09 15:24:54 Because of arms too, and also to prop up the petro dollar as world reserve. Energy/Oil & resources->Arms->Dollars/Treasuries its a full circle.

4828 2018-08-09 15:21:17 Im having to get gas every two days and it seems like no one knows what’s wrong with the car. I have a check engine light to fix the catalytic converter and when I got an oil change the other day, they told me my car might need an engine flush. Could that be it?

4871 2018-08-09 15:17:31 Shouldn't that be the first act of our government if we are really so offended by their human rights record. Tell them we won't buy their oil until they meet our expectations of a modern country. We have our own damn oil !

4888 2018-08-09 15:15:57 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
4889 2018-08-09 15:15:56 Canada can still buy Saudi oil: Riyadh: Saudi Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources issues statement saying current diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and Canada "will not, in any way, impact Saudi Aramco's relations with its customers in Canada."
4890 2018-08-09 15:15:52 Anecdotal obviously, but I've noticed a significant improvement in sleep quality since I started supplementing with CBD oil.

Less waking during the night, easier to get out of bed, quicker onset, even less of a hangover effect from drinking wine.
4891 2018-08-09 15:15:51 Soooooo true man I’ve tried to but stew from Nigerian takeaway there is no reason why egusi should be drowned in palm oil. Slightly glad the in laws r Igbo lol

4894 2018-08-09 15:15:35 No it’s on the codes listed by Reuters. China doesn’t buy any US crude, just American traders that trade futures. China gets crude from Africa, Iran and Russia. The crude from iran is pumped through Russia- very little on ships. US plans for sale of shale oil can be scrapped,
4895 2018-08-09 15:15:34 Ok I get why you're so angry.  The fact that climate change is a ratings killer and people value a strong economy over your bullshit! 

We just surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia is oil and gas production.  But oh the collusion!  #MAGA

4897 2018-08-09 15:15:25 Tonight my brother will march onto the field Lucas Oil Stadium for the first time tonight. Years of wishing this day will come and it's finally happening. 

Can't wait to watch @andrewmorri15 live out his dream in his first DCI World Championship weekend <3
4898 2018-08-09 15:15:16 I need a oil change and a car wash today 
4899 2018-08-09 15:15:12 Lesson is that breakfast is simply. You can where white without the fear of oil or pepper stains
4900 2018-08-09 15:15:06 I give up on Canada you to addicted. Junkies of crude oil. So I file citizenship in  you oil morons. I’m ashamed of being born here
4901 2018-08-09 15:15:02 Sweet potatoe chips are amazing deep-fried, you get the healthier of the chips. With the added heart-disease of oil. It's an equilibrium of sorts.
4902 2018-08-09 15:14:56 We  need regulatory bodies that are free of influence, infiltration by industry insiders! Look at Rumsfeld,Chaney! Enron! QE 1 through 6  Trudeau bought trans to stall its production as ordered! He was in France apologizing for not having destroyed Canadian Oil Yet! #traitor$
4903 2018-08-09 15:14:23 I didn't know that.  Is it a special kind of oil for what?  How do they avoid Part Time PM's blockade along the coast?
4904 2018-08-09 15:14:20 You're just wrong. Canada hasn't attacked Saudi Arabia and no Canada does not have to respect the way Saudi Arabia does anything. Ease up on human right violations, keep your oil and med students, we'll keep the wheat and SA can suck it. Deez nuts son.
4905 2018-08-09 15:14:13 Depends how trade goes. If we lose a ton a manufacturing jobs things can change quick. Oil plays a role too.. Saudi troubles can impact our inflation
4906 2018-08-09 15:13:57 Coconut oil and lemon juice.. let's see how this works on my hair
4907 2018-08-09 15:13:52 Why are we getting oil from SA, when we have our own?
4908 2018-08-09 15:13:44 Stop receiving Saudi Oil.
4909 2018-08-09 15:13:35 I believe that the Irving oil refinery is able to refine Alberta Oil....The cost of buying foreign oil over the lifespan of Energy East would make 15.7B look like a 10 cent candy.  Not including the $30 discount on WCS. And the added boost to our economy.
4910 2018-08-09 15:13:28 No hay análisis lógico que apoye las declaraciones de este verdugo del régimen.. Solo espero que cuando algún día le toque su turno, no pida clemencia.
4911 2018-08-09 15:13:23 changes. The ironic part is it's illegal to use vegetal oil for your car in many countries because of tax evasion.
4912 2018-08-09 15:13:22 Spotify, as i go through a formal name for this is what we're working on a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change
4913 2018-08-09 15:13:19 Oil change , brakes and rotors put on , new tires I’m ready and broke  until Friday
4914 2018-08-09 15:13:18 Learned my lesson about this a year ago. Now I either use jojoba or almond oil. My skin is so much better now.
4915 2018-08-09 15:13:11 Love Lucas Oil, it's a perfect venue. Everything backfield sounds like the sludge from a fracking site.
4916 2018-08-09 15:13:11 Yeah exactly. I’ve always wondered why these huge oil companies didn’t try to get ahead on renewables so they could control them. I mean I’m glad they didn’t but they have always had the money/power to do whatever, including new energy avenues.
4917 2018-08-09 15:13:06 Alot of Oil transport and Marine transport vessel are going to fail in 2020-2030 be cautious of what you buy if you don't know what UN and IMO rules are coming to shake up the Business Models in next decade, policies can kill profit and technology can wipe out encumbants
4918 2018-08-09 15:13:03 & Scottish oil & gas 
4919 2018-08-09 15:13:02 久しぶりに部活行ったけど熱中症なりかけるわ現在むずむず脚症候群で眠れないわだからもう行きたくない…まだ涼しい部屋で勉強してた方がマシ…
4920 2018-08-09 15:12:56 Did you know when the first diesel engines were built, the diesel fuel didn't exist yet. So the engine were powered by vegetal oil ( yes the same you use for the french fries!). Pre-common rail engines (before 1998) can be powered with used filtered vegetal oil with few cheap
4921 2018-08-09 15:12:51 Insanity is believing that crude oil is your saviour. Remember Satan. He’s hand up his path to hell
4922 2018-08-09 15:12:45 今日いくの？
4923 2018-08-09 15:12:37 Chefs Tip of the day @@@
Smoke Mustard oil first before using for preparing vegetables etc.. by heating to a point till light white smoke emerges from it. This would remove the potency from the oil.
4924 2018-08-09 15:12:35 I guess you didn't read the link I sent. McDonald's fry oil used to be flavored with beef tallow. Today they use hydrolyzed wheat and milk proteins instead. Not perfectly vegan cuz trace milk protein, but definitely no meat fat.
4925 2018-08-09 15:12:13 No, they have greedy socialists who only allow friends to get ahead, they have the LARGEST oil reserves in the world, the economy would BOOM down there if they had open markets and open trade
4926 2018-08-09 15:12:07 if only Canada had built pipelines to be self sufficient and export Canadian oil instead of importing OPEC oil.
4927 2018-08-09 15:12:05 ขอบคุณนะที่ยิ้มให้ ขอบคุณที่ไม่ปฏิเสธ @Oil_Nammun68
4928 2018-08-09 15:12:01 @JustinTrudeau Do not back down from Saudi Arabia.  Stop the kinder Morgan purchase.  Build a refinery in Alberta to process oil sand crude oil.  Anything else?
4929 2018-08-09 15:11:37 Sounds like the athlete himself badly wanted to go to UW.  Was basically coerced into getting out of his LOI because of family pressure.  This is sadly becoming a familiar pattern for UW as snake oil salesmen from other programs lure kids away from UW by influencing their family
4930 2018-08-09 15:11:35 Olive Oil will remove paint from your skin.
4931 2018-08-09 15:11:26 Olesin castor oil
4932 2018-08-09 15:11:23 実は昨日(日付上は2日前)にps4 買ってました、夏休みは引きこもりになるので前もって懺悔します。
4933 2018-08-09 15:11:21 Can someone explain why Saudi Arabia is happy to keep sending their oil to Canada but have cut off Canada’s wheat shipments to their country? Tongue  in cheek!!
4934 2018-08-09 15:11:12 Acting DG like fish bone in Buhari's throat....
If Buhari sacks him, wahala because he would have reconfirmed his 97% & 5% policy. If forced to appoint him, Real Buhari & Cabal will not be happy... 
Friend says if Bayelsa oil is good for North, Bayelsa DG, DSS should be good
4935 2018-08-09 15:11:02 My friend ate loads of those nuts one day and his body evacuated all the oil and he says it was absolutely horrible, so good luck with that.
4936 2018-08-09 15:10:53 Hot oil hitting your skin while cooking is the worst pain in the world
4937 2018-08-09 15:10:52 Performing in Lucas Oil was a dream I had since I saw the DCI poster in my middle school band room, and to hear that some of my students are going to step onto that historic stage for the first time in their life makes me so incredibly happy and proud. Have fun out there!
4938 2018-08-09 15:10:44 Oil and mining companies want to destroy the earth through global warming to melt the ice caps so they can mine there.

Bankers want to make the economy tank so they can make themselves richer. 

They're not interested in how the rest of us fare. Their god is Money.
4939 2018-08-09 15:10:27 Let me head to the dollar store and get you your baby oil.

4941 2018-08-09 15:10:19 Oil: Saudi Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources says current diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and Canada "will not, in any way, impact Saudi Aramco's relations with its customers in Canada."
4942 2018-08-09 15:10:11 Lets face it, it's their country and they can do what they want. Canada shouldn't be relying on Saudi oil anyways, we have plenty of our own.
4943 2018-08-09 15:10:11 Simple cleansing oil still available?
4944 2018-08-09 15:10:08 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
4945 2018-08-09 15:10:07 If you want a love message to be heard, is has got to be sent out.  To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it. #MotherTeresa #publicdiplomacy
4946 2018-08-09 15:09:49 @EUCouncil It might be good to remember at this point that although the Saudis supplied oil in WW2, Canada supplied blood and lots of it.
4947 2018-08-09 15:09:48 Thank you for responding. Olive oil would be much healthier! Also saturated fats are not bad for you. This is outdated, bad science.
4948 2018-08-09 15:09:46 Girl you should’ve put coconut oil
4949 2018-08-09 15:09:38 Maybe somebody is worried Canada might stop buying their oil? I think Canada should suspend oil imports from Saudi in retaliation.

4951 2018-08-09 15:09:26 I hate when it’s time for an oil change 
4952 2018-08-09 15:09:18 @bigfatsurprise Nina Teichholz found some interesting evidence that olive oil had many uses historically but not so much as food. The suggestion was that olive oil only entered the diet in a big way a few hundred years ago.
4953 2018-08-09 15:09:18 Conventions are a little bit different again much like cruise is slightly different - I mean more like the people travelling in for business ie Pharma Reps / Oil and Gas / Meetings / Sales People etc etc

4957 2018-08-09 15:08:41 CRUDE OIL 1D is in a correction lower. Counting the wave cycle just now a break below 66.44=support Double Bottom would signal a "bullish correction up" COMPLETE, then lower again. I mentioned 64 area correction last week, looks like 66 area would be FULL correction down. WATCH
4958 2018-08-09 15:08:41 OK, I'm thick. Why are there sanctions on Iran. I keep hearing the NWO, Zionist  State wants war on Iran.Middle East takeover of Oil.   America needs to get into anither war in the middle East why? I want to know. One of you people here must know what this is about.=

4961 2018-08-09 15:08:23 Thursday: Get an oil change for only $9.96

Most makes and models!
4962 2018-08-09 15:08:22 Oh! Yergin's The Prize is great, like the I Ching of energy. Michael Ross's The Oil Curse and Terry Lynn Karl's Paradox of Plenty. Upton Sinclair's historical fiction book Oil! is great. I want to read: Richard Rhodes's Energy: A Human History; Varun Sivaram's Taming the Sun.
4963 2018-08-09 15:08:18 I don’t know what’s better about being an adult. Waiting in line at the dmv or waiting for your oil change to be done
4964 2018-08-09 15:08:11 aku pake diffuser sal lebih awet baunya, bisa pake essential oil juga. soalnya kalo pake lilin biasa e tungku ku pagi pagi langsung kering soalnya airnya abis  kok selera kita sama hahahaha
4965 2018-08-09 15:08:09 So do you remember the first acronym for the Iraq invasion. Operation Iraqi Liberty.  Oil.  They changed liberty for freedom a day later lol it was all about oil. And only petroleum
4966 2018-08-09 15:08:06 It’s probably a combination of keeping oil / natural gas viable no matter what and  thinking going green is effeminate liberalism. They also only can think in terms of quarterly fiscal reports so their lizard brains are wired stupidly.
4967 2018-08-09 15:08:06 U got dabbable cbd or like carts? Also if u can get ur hands on some Rick Simpson oil
4968 2018-08-09 15:08:01 Unacceptable. tRump is ruining America. Fracking cuts the tops of mountains to make it easier to find oil. I’m not a conservationist but how much faster will fires travel if you have no breaks of mountains to slow down the spread of fire. tRump does it 4 revenge. No common sense.
4969 2018-08-09 15:07:44 Que lamentable ver como los expertos les recomendaron a los de a pie vender sus ecopetrol a huevo cuando lo que tenian que hacer era comorar. Hoy dia tengo 5% del portafolio en esa y creo esta sub valorada. No es para todo el mundo y hay que tener en cuenta que Colombia es oil
4970 2018-08-09 15:07:37 Right CONTROL , you said it. They ll free themselves too.. you are running out of oil money!!

4973 2018-08-09 15:07:34 Thankssss. For some folks, yes it definitely helps remove oil/build-up and can help clear their acne. For some folks, it clogs pores and can cause really bad acne. I’m the latter 
4974 2018-08-09 15:07:33 Ironically Iran has a better chance of negotiating a deal with the GOP. They are more business minded, dangle a few lucrative oil contracts for US companies & a deal can be struck. Iran also needs more sophisticated negotiators - sooner or later both parties need to negotiate.
4975 2018-08-09 15:07:30 Allegiance is proud and excited for all of our members performing at DCI Championships at Lucas Oil Stadium this weekend. Good luck. Great skill. Breathe!

4978 2018-08-09 15:07:19 Oil  and fry light  and to be honest I think they both come out the same. Download the app and there’s loads of recipes you can try. It’s really blind friendly. Even Terry said he would give it a try
4979 2018-08-09 15:07:17 she never campaigned on carbon tax BEFORE she was premier either, but here we go, everybody knows she's anti oil in oil rich province, #walkawayfromNDP
4980 2018-08-09 15:07:12 No it's to keep Israel safe. If we not in Iraq or Afghanistan,either Isis or Iran would already have them. Also it gives us more land close to Russia if they get stupid. Their oil has not benefited us. All that oil is going to rebuild their country
4981 2018-08-09 15:06:51 Things that also cost tax-payers:

Perpetual War
Having 900 military bases in over 100 countries
Subsidies for gas, oil, beef, corn, etc...
Bailing out banks
Bailing out Wall Street
Having people in jail for smoking a dried leaf.

Sunday Riley Good Genes - also amazing. Lactic acid treatment. Makes your skin look healthy and glowy.
4984 2018-08-09 15:06:39 Then why are you spending our money on an oil pipeline?!?!? A government truly committed to preparing for climate change would end all oil subsidies and invest heavily in renewables.
4985 2018-08-09 15:06:39 The mystery booms heard and trumpet sounds are the tetonic plates moving and grinding...oil was a lubricant and we have bled the oil dry....

4988 2018-08-09 15:06:29 Im glad you found the hair routine for you! I know how that is too. Pure castor oil? I googled it and pure castor oil is supposed to be an astringent that helps acne.
4989 2018-08-09 15:06:26 Psalm 23: 5-6 (KJV)
“... Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.”
4990 2018-08-09 15:06:24 They're easily revealing the weakness of our PM by setting the rules to keep their oil money. If Trudeau was a strong leader he'd shut them off by sending our oil to the east coast. If he won't everything is a revenue loss for us & a gain for them.
4991 2018-08-09 15:06:22 We have our own oil deposits, natural gas deposits (which they don’t), much more respect for our women, and an inclusive society! What do we need from them? Absolutely nothing! Good riddance I say!
4992 2018-08-09 15:06:08 Thanks! I did eventually get it off with vegetable oil. I had trouble with the stickier stuff on the other side. Had to scrape it off as well as use vegetable oil. It was all quite a bit of effort! Maybe don’t stick so much stuff on the pans? It feels unnecessary. 
4993 2018-08-09 15:06:02 งงในงง
4994 2018-08-09 15:06:01 Don’t worry, they can easily replace it with other, imported oil from Iran, Iraq or Venezuela or wherever. Anywhere but Western Canada. 

The real problem will be if Trump messes with the supply of oil to Eastern Canada. US supplies 6 barrels for every Saudi barrel.
4995 2018-08-09 15:06:00 Time for Canada to be strong and sanction these fascist scumbags. Stop buying their oil. Stop selling them weapons. End all diplomatic ties. Stop letting them push Canada around.
4996 2018-08-09 15:05:55 Where can I get coconut oil I’m asking for a friend?

5021 2018-08-09 15:04:22 i too dont like psg  (not because of neymar but cuz of oil money thing)
5022 2018-08-09 15:04:01 Does vegan beard oil really exist? It’s just been mentioned at work and I’ve just finished banging my head on the desk.
5023 2018-08-09 15:03:58 Hey Guys,
Don’t use coconut oil on your face. It can clog your pores or result in excess sebum (the oil your body naturally produces). Look for oils with a lower comedogenic number like jojoba or argan oil.
5024 2018-08-09 15:03:55 The oil imparts a flavor to the fries, so you can’t say that they are “just potatoes”. They’re less pure potato than yogurt is pure milk.
5025 2018-08-09 15:03:46 Yg oil 3 bundle apa satuan?
5026 2018-08-09 15:03:44 My understanding is that domestically produced oil is consumed abroad.

5028 2018-08-09 15:03:40 There's nary a candle nor a drop of whale oil in this desolate abode.
5029 2018-08-09 15:03:38 But those who consider themselves Royalty are ,in essence, ultra religious extremists, if not for oil, would have died off decades ago
5030 2018-08-09 15:03:37 Maybe we just shouldn't accept KSA oil shipments anymore!   All the silly fuss about BC shipped oil and yet we move KSA oil up the St Lawrence with absolutely no concerns...

5032 2018-08-09 15:03:33 @TODAYshow Your report this morning on CBD/marijuana was full of contradictory/incomplete info.  Vast majority of cannabinoid rich oil is from HEMP.  Give me a call.  I’ll help.  #delirioushappylife

5039 2018-08-09 15:02:40 Tell me about it? Or just good old science? 
I remember having a problem with @TullowOilplc  scholarship award in Ke, with similar trends , nothing on geophysics, geochemistry, seismology, oil Engineering etc. It was largely law, sociology and procurement
5040 2018-08-09 15:02:36 Canadians rely on fossil fuels for their daily lives. Dont you want canada to be self sufficient? Look at the issues with Saudi Arabia - we get oil from them when we could get it from home. Indigenous peoples are given a lot from us, not sure what else can be done.
5041 2018-08-09 15:02:36 Or blinker fluid technician.....
5042 2018-08-09 15:02:27 So they continue to take our money but stop allowing us to make money from them?
Because the #Liberals stopped #EnergyEast I guess we'll just continue bleeding $$ and not use our own oil.

#Saudi wins.
5043 2018-08-09 15:02:23 Hey @mikexingchen where did you get that “Powered by: hot oil” shirt from?
5044 2018-08-09 15:02:22 You can easily get crayon and marker out with orange oil based cleaner and shampoo the carpets but that’s the responsibly of the land lord. When I was in high school my aunt got hospitalized because she was hoarding animals. They had to replace all the carpeting and furniture
5045 2018-08-09 15:02:08 The odd bicoluoring of the break where the oil is tells me it may have been fractured for some time. Might want to add a UV flashlight to your maintenance bag.
5046 2018-08-09 15:02:06 I think they need to oil the transfer window. It never just closes. It just slams shut. #TransferDeadlineDay
5047 2018-08-09 15:02:03 All capitalist countries are eventually taken over by bribing their rulers. 
With oil, all our governments are ripe for plucking, for power rolls on golden wheels. Thieves DO prosper and RULE. Badly....
5048 2018-08-09 15:02:01 This president believes he can get oil cheaper from SA than canada and that SA will produce more if we help them win a local war and sell them weapons. I’m sure the administration has assurances they’ll take it easy on Israel too.
5049 2018-08-09 15:01:53 Quite well said. A hundred million americans just can't join the dots. And a few million more are just a greedy oil slick floating on top.
5050 2018-08-09 15:01:39 Think we both know the answer here Oil.

5053 2018-08-09 15:01:35 I use coconut oil (melted) & Tumeric for whitening my teeth naturally. The tumeric stains everything BUT your teeth oddly enough. Try it.
5054 2018-08-09 15:01:28 I think people just see leaves in a salad but the other stuff makes it! I first got it into it in Spain where an ensalada mixta is lettuce, onions & tomatoes with olive oil & vinegar perfect!

Yes, baby is 14lbs & not yet 6 weeks old. He's on the 98th centile for his age i.e FAT!
5055 2018-08-09 15:01:21 Ya I re read it sorry. Damm Saudi’s are running out of oil. They are now planning on how to exploit the world with their oily greaseball cash.

NATGAS breaks 2.952=resist only to pull back, but does not break below 2.935 to confirm bearish during EIA release???
5062 2018-08-09 15:00:49 Let me be honest with you.  I think the war in Iraq was a mistake.  I think being dependent on oil is a mistake.  I'd like to leave you guys to yourself.  The irony is, the terrorism doesn't help that.  You poke the hornet's nest, then complain that they follow you home.

5075 2018-08-09 14:59:20 The markets have changed little from opening to closing after rising throughout the morning, before losing almost all gains made in throughout the afternoon as Brent Oil dropped sharply driving Gas and Power downwards as US stockpiles of Oil declined much less than expected.

5081 2018-08-09 14:59:08 @JustinTrudeau stop buying oil from Saudi, you have enough reserves of your own!
5082 2018-08-09 14:59:05 $CL_F oil summer trading = slow moving ranges, then sudden spike moves.  Pretty painful to trade since 90% is waiting...
5083 2018-08-09 14:58:55 They can lie public without any type of remorse too, no problem. I am wondering how many people still thinks Elon is a nice, thoroughly honest guy. Only external circumstances like oil and ICE industry or shorts prevents him to reach his altruistic goals.

5089 2018-08-09 14:58:13 I understand completely lol While I’m hear do you still have beard oil available 
5090 2018-08-09 14:58:03 Does your pamphlet include an in depth explanation of where the oil fund would come from?
Mainly for your benefit of course.
5091 2018-08-09 14:58:02 Bought make up remover wipes but I still end up with baby oil cos nothing removes make up better the Johnsons baby oil 
5092 2018-08-09 14:58:00 If he really had guts to 'stand up' to the Saudi's he'd ship Canadian oil to the east coast & shut them out. The world is laughing at our PM because they know he doesn't dare. They're showing the world how shallow & weak his words & threats really are.
5093 2018-08-09 14:58:00 My current oil play is PBR.
5094 2018-08-09 14:57:58 Because the transportation corridor (pipeline/truck/railcar) from west to east has insufficient capacity to meet eastern Canada's needs. The Irving refinery in NB is almost exclusively supplied by oil tankers (no pipeline available).

5099 2018-08-09 14:57:35 Real chips do. French fries just taste like oil and salt.

Note that as an Australian, there may be a language discrepancy as to what is classified as a French Fry - For us, French Fries are distinguished by their thinness. If it's more than about 4mm wide, it's just a chip.
5100 2018-08-09 14:57:33 The lowest price for Oil Juniors in a year is TAX LOSS season. You buy them when institutions are forced selling to capture the tax deductable losses for that year, and then you ride it up into the next quarter earning during the drilling season for good gains.

Uh huh. Oil is dead. Sure. 

You @BCGreens have the business sense of a cow, and the ethics of its waste. Live what you preach and some might listen. Until then it’s all just “political blah”.

5112 2018-08-09 14:56:24 Jimmy Carter's forward-looking energy policy was terminated by Reagan, who turned energy over to big oil and nuclear. We've had multiple, deficit-financed oil wars since then and nuclear remains a trillion-dollar taxpayer liability.

Islam is Islam everywhere!
5116 2018-08-09 14:55:51 If our virtue signalled federal government really wanted to make a statement on womens rights and human rights, they would have stopped buying oil from SA a long time ago. I guess we know their real thoughts on human rights now!
5117 2018-08-09 14:55:51 This morning I thought it was a great idea to put a little bit of tanning oil on instead of sun cream. Spent the rest of the day trying to wash it off in the pool whilst sweating profusely and now fucking regretting it. Back to the factor 30 for a day or so tomorrow 
5118 2018-08-09 14:55:38 What talking points? I'm not a Democrat. I see news and disseminate it. I have no problem being allies with the country based on certain conditions. Saudi Arabia has not met those. 

I follow Thomas wictor. Take away the oil and ask yourself if Saudi Arabia is still our Ally?
5119 2018-08-09 14:55:32 Keep your oil, we have our own. 
5120 2018-08-09 14:55:30 Sorry for the delay, Chris. The Valvoline Full Synthetic with MaxLife Technology, (Valvoline High Mileage) is the oil we recommend for that engine. Let us know if there's anything else we can help you with.
5121 2018-08-09 14:55:28 So apparently lemon oil is an appetite suppressant. So, guess who is drinking lemon water
5122 2018-08-09 14:55:24 Using olive oil to cook, esp GOYA, you'll be fresh with no pimples.
5123 2018-08-09 14:55:21 This is not relevant but frontier oil company (FWO) is trying to get the pipelines to control the supply of Petrol/Diesel (for “national interest” obviously), the new government will serve it to them in a platter
5124 2018-08-09 14:55:16 I use the organic coconut oil. I'll have to try the other; although, not sure if healthwise, one is better than the other. What are your thoughts?
5125 2018-08-09 14:55:14 Hahaha how much of oil do you have, is it going to be enough for u in few days?
5126 2018-08-09 14:55:14 Oil cos are doing their best to keep the present arrangement though. Will need some key cogs to move away from that.

5128 2018-08-09 14:55:14 Good point. I think expunging Obama's legacy is job one for Trump and a little further down the list of priorities for the GOP. But doing so aligns oh-so-nicely with the GOP mandate to rape and plunder the environment en route to feeding their big oil, big coal benefactors.
5129 2018-08-09 14:55:08 Muscle tension & stress often cause dysmotility. My tricks: Eat less, drink more. Cut out sugar & dairy for a week (nuts & high fiber too). If it helps, keep those things in check. Peppermint oil with food (wait a few hours to sleep). Peppermint lifesavers for nausea. No alcohol.
5130 2018-08-09 14:55:06 Every available dollar is sent to the war machine to balkanize the Middle East for Israel, help Saudi Arabia bomb Yemen or secure submissive leaders and clear land for oil and gas acquisitions. Nothing short of changing this status quo will really make America 'great'. Sad times
5131 2018-08-09 14:54:54 Stop buying their oil and start a serious plan to use alternative energy by making it easier and cheaper

5142 2018-08-09 14:54:08 Will environmental zealots be dictating UK trade policy, after Brexit? UK continues to fund @RFUK and others – whose goal is to restrict palm oil. This would harm future trade cooperation, including CPTPP... (1/2)
5143 2018-08-09 14:54:06 Measure eight scoops of olive oil then put back on heat.
5144 2018-08-09 14:53:56 She, I assume it's female, is utterly delusional. Wacko just making up share nonsense but then that's your average #Nat for you . I've just tweet #ScotsGov own stats on Oil Revenue so little else. Total no hope for this eejit.
5145 2018-08-09 14:53:54 That's all good, but charity begins at home. Start honoring the treaties made with indigenous. Stop destroying the environment. Say no to oil and invest in alternative energy. I mean Saudis are screwed, but how can we advocate human rights when we go against them all the time

5147 2018-08-09 14:53:50 The vast majority of the major problems on this planet can be attributed to us selling arms to the Middle East and importing their oil. Period. We shouldn't be doing either. If our Liberal government really had any balls beyond lip service they would stop doing both. #Canpoli

But Patanjali authority have been keeping mum. Have they accepted the result of the test?
5152 2018-08-09 14:53:19 If we'd use every oil drill we have, we'd produce more oil than the Middle East daily. There's be no need to import. But we could also switch over to clean energy any day and never have to use our again.

5160 2018-08-09 14:52:35 It's also true. (You should link video clip of actual incident.) You nailed it  on the head. Hence the Left's efforts to immediately silence you.

5171 2018-08-09 14:51:52 Well Services can OUTPERFORM oil producers when the cycle starts. Everyone and there dog needs the same equipment when its Game On. When the NICHE service you offer is desired by everyone and there is one crew and one rig the

5176 2018-08-09 14:51:31 A lot more fries these days have been frozen instead of being freshly cut. Between that and the choice of oil, they can seem a lot different.  :)

5180 2018-08-09 14:51:18 @realDonaldTrump please get off the Statin drug.  they cause dementia. You can drink flaxseed oil and fish oil and it will actually heal you.
5181 2018-08-09 14:51:16 Where is the INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE? Nowhere....governments afraid of a BULLY, with oil. How pathetic. They keep on KILLING ( dead) innocent people with IMPUNITY because nobody dares to say one word. COWARDICE. This is COWARDICE. And one expected an "ally" to stand by Canada?
5182 2018-08-09 14:51:04 My brother was heating up oil in a pan and it BURST INTO FLAMES......luckily I was there and knew to cover a flame bc his only solution was to call 911. My fight or flight senses are still tingling
5183 2018-08-09 14:50:56 You can't. They are brainwashed from cradle to grave. It makes them more malleable and prone to falling for any snake oil salesman who mentions the god word.
5184 2018-08-09 14:50:55 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
5185 2018-08-09 14:50:48 I often make it up as I go! And bake the mixture at 180 C for 20 minutes. Makes 12 muffins. I can give you the basic recipe... I often substitute for healthier ingredients (like apple sauce instead of oil or leave out the sugar etc)
5186 2018-08-09 14:50:47 Saudi thing is mostly virtue signaling. Still selling them LAVs to appease Ont and still buying their oil to appease Que.
5187 2018-08-09 14:50:45 I need more spirikoko people in my life . The oil on my head is about to run dry. 
5188 2018-08-09 14:50:43 Hey @JustinTrudeau can we stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia now? I know oil is nice and all, but living CHILDREN and GREEN ENERGY are much nicer in my opinion

5190 2018-08-09 14:50:40 We can continue buying their oil. Didn't see that coming ...
5191 2018-08-09 14:50:39 What I find is hilarious is that the same people who are complaining about the market price of Canadian oil are the same people talking about undercutting the Russian sale of oil to the Chinese. 
That’s driving with one foot on the gas and the other on the brakes!
5192 2018-08-09 14:50:38 Stop buying oil from ksa hahahaha ... read about oil please

5202 2018-08-09 14:49:53 and Colombia doesn't have Venezuela's oil
5203 2018-08-09 14:49:53 Fries have been largely made the same way since the 60s, aside from the oil. They can taste more or less starchy depending on how well the surface starch has been removed, but as a giant ball of starch they have always been a “starch mixture”.

5217 2018-08-09 14:49:11 Soda is, my bad. But French fries from most fast food places are not because of the oil/fat it’s cooked in

What will you do dif? How will you handle the dimwit south? Saudis now? Oil & renewables? I heard nothing...
5223 2018-08-09 14:48:32 Potatoes taste like potatoes. French fries taste like crunchy with salt and oil.
5224 2018-08-09 14:48:28 I gotta learn how to change my own oil. An oil change in my car is too expensive

5227 2018-08-09 14:48:09 Snake Oil Salesman
5228 2018-08-09 14:48:09 They didn’t help of course, but the main issue is collapsing oil prices in a country where oil is 90% of the exports and an inability to get loans, US sanctions, and economic sabatage by right wing neighbors and private companies.
5229 2018-08-09 14:48:07 Of course.  It is income$$$$$.  And they control oil
5230 2018-08-09 14:48:01 As long as you can draw you can probably paint decently! I struggle constantly with oil sketching but you learn a bit on each one!
5231 2018-08-09 14:48:00 George Soros is the Standard Oil of our day. He has his grubby hands on everything.

5233 2018-08-09 14:47:57 We have oil, how about we stop giving the Saudis money and they can keep their damn oil! #JustinTrudeau
5234 2018-08-09 14:47:49 Plan is end sales tax go full out on carbon tax end fossil fuel greed and start a high tech economy on renewable resources. Creates jobs education and a new progress. Oil creates chemicals that don’t cure health and don’t cure economy .
5235 2018-08-09 14:47:20 Maybe the russian start to sanction NATO, no oil, no gas, no steel, no aluminium, no wheat, no uranium, plastics and every other nation who trade these goods with NATO will be punished in the way like NATO does.

jajajaja never more
5238 2018-08-09 14:46:57 Is it the dry grilled chicken that’s good? Or the meatless chicken wings? Or the original oil ? Cuz I’m confused... I have them many chances u know.. u Haffi tell me which one cuz 
5239 2018-08-09 14:46:56 Jiffy Lube employees out here trying to smooze me and fast talk me like I don’t see them trying to run up my bill. Change my oil and let me be!
5240 2018-08-09 14:46:52 So they cancel taking our wheat and we keep taking their oil.
5241 2018-08-09 14:46:45 Well, they seem to have forgotten to nationalize most of their industries.  In the meantime, capital controls and a nationalized oil industry didn’t cause this problem.

5243 2018-08-09 14:46:32 That is an inaccurate reading of the logic of the policy and oil markets in this context. And it's had negative effects for Russia's medium-term production and export outlook. Sanctions don't happen because of convenience in Washington D.C. and MinEnergo/Russia's NSC are worried.
5244 2018-08-09 14:46:27 We must stop buying their oil.
5245 2018-08-09 14:46:21 Kelley, U obviously know him better than I, do U believe he has actually gotten to the point where he believes his own crap? I see him as someone who plays a roll, pandering snake oil 4profit. 2me that’s actually worse. Doing the damage he does without regard knowing it’s BS.

5247 2018-08-09 14:46:11 Saudi's will continue to ship Canada oil. Why would we take it???? Why are we spending billions.
5248 2018-08-09 14:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet open borders.

5252 2018-08-09 14:45:48 You should always be careful when you change lanes. Hitting someone is the most obvious danger, but there are others. Cutting in front of someone can cause them to overreact and lose control. Changing lanes if there’s something slippery on the road (like ice or oil) can cause...
5253 2018-08-09 14:45:48 Gue udah termabukkan dengan Essential Oil. Jadi pusing mikirin harganya.
5254 2018-08-09 14:45:48 I really hope someone says that you're "no oil painting", just so you can "well, actually" them.
5255 2018-08-09 14:45:47 Work in the Oil and Gas industry, we report back to the US in $. We were having a hard time before the Ref and fall in £. It has helped reduce the value of our long term inventory value in the eyes of our US shareholders.

5257 2018-08-09 14:45:12 Indeed. If we had the Energy East pipeline, it would displace Saudi oil imports. If we had Trans Mountain it would diversify our customer base so we are not held hostage by Trumpistan.
5258 2018-08-09 14:45:12 Peppermint oil - a few drops on the back of neck, temples, etc. For larger areas like arms or legs use a little water to disperse the oil better. So relaxing and cooling.

5260 2018-08-09 14:44:58 Hot Peppers + Olive Oil. I think i almost experienced death just now
5261 2018-08-09 14:44:56 Honestly I blame the fact that not EVERY ce from part one does stuff in part 2. If the water/food one would also grab oil/cement I think it'd be easier rather than making brand new ones we have to go after for everything

5265 2018-08-09 14:44:33 Trudeau is being held hostage by Saudi oil & doesn't have the guts to fight back by using our own oil. The world is laughing at our self-proclaimed globalist PM.
5266 2018-08-09 14:44:30 Dear omokri tell Nigerian how you get your wealth and your involvement in 1 trillion oil deal
5267 2018-08-09 14:44:27 Well done. Great followup would be on-camera interview with Dan Haley, the formerly longtime journalist who as head of Colorado Oil & Gas Association was behind this smear site.
5268 2018-08-09 14:44:26 Stay out of Westfields.  Bond Street is the place to be, you go gal xxx and tell them how to do it xxx  I am still giggling about the suspension focl.  Anyway give lynthip my love x
5269 2018-08-09 14:44:04 Of course...way PAY for their OIL, don't we ? Maybe we SHOULD find another source of oil, for the East Coast..Maybe it is time to cut all ties with this country until they, at least STOP bullying us or anybody else. And for how long are we going to see these faces in our media?
5270 2018-08-09 14:44:01 Yes sarsoon ka oil
5271 2018-08-09 14:43:54 ABN Amro 1/2: Due to expected shortages in oil supply we have raised our oil price  forecasts for 2019 and 2020. The lack of oil supply will be the result  of several developments. We expect that global demand for oil will  continue to grow at a moderate pace in the coming years.
5272 2018-08-09 14:43:46 All I need to know if they use trans fat oil like palm or coconut oil. All bread and cookies use palm oil in grocery markets.

5276 2018-08-09 14:43:24 "I'll have the coal burger and a large crude oil thanks."
5277 2018-08-09 14:43:16 The Saudis are one of the brutal dictatorships the US has long considered an ally because the US buys their oil and sells them guns. As opposed to those other dictatorships the US starts interventionist wars in for "humanitarian" reasons.

5280 2018-08-09 14:43:03 Does he know anything about cars?
5281 2018-08-09 14:42:45 Well we tend to buy most of our oil from Venezuela not Saudi, Canada produces over 3 million barrels per day most of which is exported to the US
5282 2018-08-09 14:42:42 They either taste like potatoes or like the oil they were cooked in.
5283 2018-08-09 14:42:40 I'd be perfectly fine had he called out Saudi Arabia and we had energy east pipeline to provide Atlantic provinces with Canadian oil, now he's stuck between a rock and a hard place
5284 2018-08-09 14:42:35 2/ Also realize the massive oil and auto disruption successful electric cars will be causing. They ain’t going down quietly no matter who the threat will be.
5285 2018-08-09 14:42:21 Who’s on the beat coco oil
5286 2018-08-09 14:42:06 And...if anyone thinks that corporate money is going to trickle down, think again. CEOs are not altruistic. They are in business to make money and bigger profits.  Certainly big pharma, oil, Wall Street are far from generous. They reinvest their $ to make more $.
5287 2018-08-09 14:41:57 You don’t think it is not traumatic for animal families, or kill shelters etc? Do tell how suddently, only one kind of life matter is that it? Or positing with fracking and oil spills?
5288 2018-08-09 14:41:51 "John Pilger referred to the 'current conspiracy' between the US & Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil in order to create a coup in Venezuela. So they could rollback some of the world's most important social reforms"
5289 2018-08-09 14:41:47 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
5290 2018-08-09 14:41:39 To invest in Oil and gas. Most Alberta producers Q1 numbers were better than Q2 and Q3 will be lower than Q4. Meaning we could see a easy to pick off buying dip between Q3 & Q4. The Q2 low is due to spring break up/Oil prices.
5291 2018-08-09 14:41:15 ( do you take fish oil? I highly recommend it, its done wonders for me! )
5292 2018-08-09 14:41:11 I mean, potatoes can be prepared in different ways .. My mom has a way of cooking breakfast potatoes .. sliced thin and pan-fried in oil. And those are basically french-fry discs. So I voted yes.
5293 2018-08-09 14:41:04 Neoliberalism gave the educated & ambitious, as a group, permission to be predators (behind smokescreen of shareholder value), when they should have been stewards. Ramanathan's profound & challenging point reverses that; that's the big barrier in solving climate, not oil cos.
5294 2018-08-09 14:40:48 In my youth, if you went to the store for corned beef, you got corned beef. Period. Today, they ask if you want it in canola oil, vegetable oil or water; halal or kosher, free range or farm-fed. I miss the clarity of choices of my childhood. This diarrhea of choices is poverty.
5295 2018-08-09 14:40:48 Think of the True Human Rights stand Canada could have made IF we’d completed Energy East PIPELINE. We could tell the Saudis that we don’t need their oil until they treat humanity better. Opportunity lost and it’s ALL on the Trudeau govt!
5296 2018-08-09 14:40:43 The planet is on fire, so I say support only Dems who do not take  from oil, gas, coal. That would bring in some “Green” folks and maybe save us from extinction
5297 2018-08-09 14:40:36 Holy fuck I’m performing in Lucas Oil
5298 2018-08-09 14:40:34 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
5299 2018-08-09 14:40:21 my parents are so weird. my mom comes in my room while i’m sleep n just starts rubbing oil on my hair... then i fell asleep watching parks & rec n i wake up to my dad sitting next to me watching it on my phone n laughing. wtf
5300 2018-08-09 14:40:14 It's significant and my fear is that the oil people are using short traders to kill it before it get started at all. Yes, it will be tough when all Auto companies start launching their EV but @Tesla is way ahead. If they can execute first without distraction..they will win!
5301 2018-08-09 14:40:14 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
5302 2018-08-09 14:39:49 maybe its time that we stop purchasing their oil
5303 2018-08-09 14:39:48 I don’t mind taking my car to Chevy to get serviced but fuck it takes like four fucking hours just for an oil change.
5304 2018-08-09 14:39:40 I dont eat oil at all, and I use a 5$ non stick pot with a chewed up handle i got from goodwill
5305 2018-08-09 14:39:39 If ever there was a time that it is more apparent Canada needs to step up and improve oil infastructure and be more self reliant it is now.
5306 2018-08-09 14:39:24 You got gas money? Because last time I checked the price of oil is going up
5307 2018-08-09 14:39:23 We are a net exporter of oil.
5308 2018-08-09 14:39:19 Beh...lavorando io nel settore oil&gas so come dono messe le cose nella regione.
Lavoro per più ditte, di cui una francese ed una tedesca (che prima era italiana).
Non posso che confermare..
5309 2018-08-09 14:39:17 Oh Chitty ...I got suspended once...you need a get out of jail card from Monopoly  i did comment on your LSE thread and then every thing got removed . Be a good girl in the meantime..PS i saw my Mulberry bag at Westfields the other day !! Blooming beauty she is.
5310 2018-08-09 14:39:15 CBD oil is fake news
5311 2018-08-09 14:39:14 Look when you use other games as a reason as to why rage can work in smash even though both games in general function like oil and water. I cant take that seriously. Especially when in tekken you dont die to one hit. You have a life bar in smash you have a %..
5312 2018-08-09 14:39:06 two main factors: what were they fried in and how freshly were they cut.

5314 2018-08-09 14:38:58 BC buys US oil.  A tanker from Alaska carrying 90 000 barrels of oil a DAY is brought into Vancouver harbour.

5318 2018-08-09 14:38:23 We are good to annually buy millions of bbls of Saudi oil?
5319 2018-08-09 14:38:20 And when the demand for oil fades, then who sets the price?  Supplies can be and are manipulated.
5320 2018-08-09 14:38:20 I don’t like that we import 16% of our oil and even more from the U.S. but your conflating with straws makes me wonder if you even understand the reasons why we import oil. It’s because we don’t have the infrastructure. Most of our revenue comes from the export of raw materials.
5321 2018-08-09 14:38:15 Lol oil exports aren’t impacted but students studying here as well as doctors are? This doesn’t make sense.
5322 2018-08-09 14:37:58 The Irving family who basically owns Trudeau and his BF Dominic leBlanc makes too much money refinery Saudi oil and would never allow Saudi oil to be banned. Even the Saudi’s know that.
5323 2018-08-09 14:37:35 Does America  really NEED their Oil that badly or is it that #Exxon #Kochs &gang are so invested there we help #SaudiArabia commit #Genocide against #Yemen?

5325 2018-08-09 14:37:28 yes, thanks Jimbo for notebook updates! Gotta love Mr. Blue and Mr. White. Have a great day guys!
5326 2018-08-09 14:37:21 Your resources fund your social safety net. If our oil supported socialized medicine, I’d support a pipeline running through the Grand Canyon and the White House lawn.
5327 2018-08-09 14:37:20 The first time I used CBD I had a sleepless night. I have used different strains and strength, to no avail. What has really helped my insomnia is magnesium oil. Incredible stuff.
5328 2018-08-09 14:37:17 @loccitaneusa  Home diffuser oil in NÉROLI & ORCHIDÉE is needed! The store smelled absolutely amazing, employee said they have NÉROLI & ORCHIDÉE in a diffuser, come to find out you do not make it in this scent!!! Pleassseeee!!! Best scent I've ever smelled!

5330 2018-08-09 14:37:01 Trump has  dealt with them more harshly than Obama.He took out a unit in Syria, took steps to stop NATO countries from buying oil from them, & yesterday announced new sanctions.Obama gave them a reset button & whispered in a Russian ear about  greater flexibility after elections.
5331 2018-08-09 14:36:44 Sanctions against the regime’s oil exports and Central Bank will accelerate the collapse of the regime as the Constitutional Revolution continues to gain momentum.Cut off the funding sustaining Khamenei’s henchmen and their activities to destabilize the ME and destroy Israel.

5337 2018-08-09 14:36:18 A lot has been written about it.  You have noted first Shanghai oil futures contract settles in Sept,  Bloomberg, CNBC, Russia Today, etc. note that gold settlement offered.  Tweets link to background docs.

5338 2018-08-09 14:36:18 I forgot the word “diffuser” and complimented my coworker on how nice her “oil disseminator” smelled so now I have to go home and never return
5339 2018-08-09 14:36:14 Screw them, stop buying oil off Saudi Arabia. Nobody, nobody bullies Canada or Canadians.
5340 2018-08-09 14:36:13 Let's see. Does the US discourage US banks & European banks from doing business with Venezuela? Did Saudi Arabia flood the market with cheap oil back in 2014? Do the private corporations that own food distributors hoard & create scarcities?
5341 2018-08-09 14:35:53 #cnn #foxnews #abcnews  YES Before Flood (Oil & Gas Deposits under Sediments) the barometric pressure was similar to Hyperbaric Chamber - Pure Oxygen.  No meat needed.

5343 2018-08-09 14:35:42 @realDonaldTrump the full boycott of Iran's oil will end the work of the kings of terror And then the world will reach the peak of flourishing and beauty.

5345 2018-08-09 14:35:24 Lmao these Lebanese marijuana farmers one say ein paddy smoke the wee ah then ein wife turn princess...anothr to say wee is at the same level of importance with Oil. I sure say @Yujeannn & @_aggreyy go change nationality soon
5346 2018-08-09 14:35:21 @realDonaldTrump Countries that really want to establish peace in the world and those who, after 40 years of freedom of punishment, are really entitled to freedom of our people, just enough to join the boycott of oil
5347 2018-08-09 14:35:06 Public spending and administration is never, ever, ever going to be cut back. Our leaders don’t have the vision or the will. Oil will offer short reprieves. We’re loaded with resources and we waste it.

5349 2018-08-09 14:34:47 No they are not, just pointing out the hypocrisy of this. Where are the tweets on China? Iran? When will Trudeau stop the flow of Saudi oil? Why was Canada buying it in the first place?

5351 2018-08-09 14:34:29 Phew,  thank goodness. It seems the Saudi Kingdom is only mad enough to stop investments, but continue to benefit from our investment in their oil. Hmm wake up #GovCan, move out across Canada invest in cross Canada pipeline and steel pipe plants!
5352 2018-08-09 14:34:15 I love this Federal govt initiative on tracking of Crude Oil theft in Nigeria. This technology is phenomenon, it will really boost Nigeria foreign reserve. Imagine our country loosing 2000 tankers (33000 litres) of Crude Oil per day to thieves.  Holy Moses!
5353 2018-08-09 14:34:15 Just because my truck is a 17 bae won’t touch it I don’t feel like sitting at a dealership for an oil change. But it is free

5358 2018-08-09 14:33:39 That's because chinese had diversified their oil imports from emirates and iran. Russia has harder time to find buyers. Also OPEC is less agreable with saudi-iran rift, and whole syrian business where interests are opposite.
5359 2018-08-09 14:33:24 Leaking oil early
5360 2018-08-09 14:33:18 Easy way to shutdown Saudia Arabia... stop buying their oil. Without oil, it would be a sand dune of a nation dependent on handouts from west to survive. And that day is coming sooner than they realize .
5361 2018-08-09 14:33:14 What's your take on canola oil? Guys at @virtahealth recommend it as a cheaper alternative to olive oil
5362 2018-08-09 14:33:04 Can’t afford to leak any more oil
5363 2018-08-09 14:32:57 Oh lol I"m sorry. Castor oil. Sticky but great for your scalp :) apply with love.

5370 2018-08-09 14:32:34 BOTH HAHAHAHAHA. Rice with oil ughhhhh

5373 2018-08-09 14:32:20 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both finished Wednesday roughly 0.5% from new records.

Oil prices fell to their lowest level in more than six weeks Wednesday as U.S. stockpiles of oil and fuel hit a seven-month high.
5374 2018-08-09 14:32:09 I’m pretty sure ‘oil money’ is 2 words
5375 2018-08-09 14:32:05 As soon as these goons run out of oil
5376 2018-08-09 14:32:04 Not trying to be anti pipeline or train transporting oil here. But seems to me that processing bitumen near extraction site for canadian use would be safer...but there is way to much tar sand for Canada,the industry need to export to survive.
5377 2018-08-09 14:32:02 Will they accept a ballot sent in with dab oil and ants smeared all over it?
5378 2018-08-09 14:32:00 Oil futures and contracts and gas contracts are directly tied. Also US would like to sell gas and oil to europe. For example Poland would like to buy US oil, but for now both the price and supply is quite limited. Therefore we bought 8% more gas from russia this year.
5379 2018-08-09 14:31:59 More like $1.9 mm on the initial spacing assumption, adjusted for production value. 
Tier 2 at $55 oil and one year payout? Interesting definition.
5380 2018-08-09 14:31:55 Further, Russian firms are definitely facing oil market pressures related to, but not entirely caused by, the sanctions regime in Europe.

5382 2018-08-09 14:31:43 But why would we want to import oil from them when Alberta could service Canada.  Makes no sense

5389 2018-08-09 14:31:12 Very good point.  Many bottles can be refilled or recycled. 
Some problem solvers to consider: Recycling is not enforced enough. New plastic is not needed (funds the oil industry), more time is needed for home cooking; ban plastic bags, wrapping and bottles.
5390 2018-08-09 14:31:10 I’ve got my fingers crossed for the chocolates and baby oil.
5391 2018-08-09 14:31:08 I am reminded of Red Adair, and the method for capping oil wells in Kuwait.

They'd basically set off an explosion at the well head. The resulting explosion would temporarily consume all the oxygen, extinguishing the fire long enough to cap it.

5396 2018-08-09 14:30:46 There is a segment of fire science that uses explosives to starve s fire of oxygen. This is how oil well fires are extinguished. Not first fires of this size.
5397 2018-08-09 14:30:43 Financial planning/ wealth management is the biggest scam industry since snake oil. Name of the game is constantly acquire more assets, do enough schmoozing, minimal work, dont let clients sell, collect 1%. What could be better? Lol

UK debt underwritten by Scots oil and gas who are leaving UK.

Hope that clears it up.
5403 2018-08-09 14:30:22 Our strong and courageous PM should certainly block all Saudi oil shipments to Eastern Canada given his firm stance on human rights.
5404 2018-08-09 14:30:20 You are weak
5405 2018-08-09 14:30:11 Belum menemukan eye make up remover seciamik minyak zaitun martha tilaar. Basically, semua merk olive oil bisa jadi make up remover sih. Diusap santai ga pake tenaga keangkat semua, dahsyat bukan?
5406 2018-08-09 14:30:09 Is similar to blowing up oil wells that are on fire. It works...

5408 2018-08-09 14:29:59 What a joke this country has become !!  Honestly !!  If this Gov. was truly pissed off with the Saudis they could stop buying their oil ! It's not like we don't have our OWN !!  Bunch of idiots !!
5409 2018-08-09 14:29:55 Oil?
5410 2018-08-09 14:29:54 That's simply not true. The US didn't go after Gazprom the same as the oil sector until more recent scrutiny from congress. The target was the oil sector because of its role as a revenue generator, and oil markets don't work politically like gas markets do.
5411 2018-08-09 14:29:51 They are racist white supremest in fear made by  the fascist media indoctrinating talking heads that cast this racism for GOP votes as the NRA cast this fear also as big oil cast fear and millions of $$ to kill alternative energy!!

5414 2018-08-09 14:29:42 I picture Miller & Pence with olive oil on plastic sheets and both yelling mother.
5415 2018-08-09 14:29:35 Unseasoned meat like thinly sliced brisket or pork belly (which you traditionally dip into a mix of sesame oil, salt, and pepper)? Also good with rice.
5416 2018-08-09 14:29:35 Bahan yang perlu disiapkan hanyalah produk pembersih wajah, face oil, scrub, masker dan serum.
5417 2018-08-09 14:29:35 This is 100% why we need to make our own OIL and not give a S*%1 about OPEC pricing.
Then we don't have to do anything Saudi says.
5418 2018-08-09 14:29:26 Except energy East has nothing to do with independence from Saudi barbarian oil
5419 2018-08-09 14:29:25 I know it's just for testing, but the paint scheme of Hinch's nosecone on Wickens' car is pretty cool.
5420 2018-08-09 14:29:10 Yet this government continues to purchase oil from this country instead of supporting Canada, see the hypocrisy or is it because it does fit the narrative ?
5421 2018-08-09 14:28:59 They know how the UK taxes oil and how they virtually let companies take it out of the ground for free. Only to tax London HQs later. They don't do enough to highlight this and people worry this is because they won't challenge the way things are done. Not just with oil either.

5423 2018-08-09 14:28:31 I am long calls in $USO $PBR $HAL Tariffs may be an election ploy / tactic but the Iran oil sanctions are going to happen imo. Even losing 1/3 of its 4M/day production matters. Unrelated, i like $SONO puts.
5424 2018-08-09 14:28:31 Errr so why do the oil majors now all acknowledge that AGW is real? What’s in it for them?
5425 2018-08-09 14:28:30 But what if Russia wants it to be warmer? They get the biggest landmass on Earth plus they get northern open water ports and they get to sell all that oil to make it happen. Winning game for Russia.  If they could just make sure all those brown people don't flood their paradise.
5426 2018-08-09 14:28:28 They use explosives to put out fires at oil derricks.
5427 2018-08-09 14:28:22 Explain again how property values over a million dollars (and rising) are somehow loosing equity? Name a single person who won't drive their SUV to the beach because (3 miles or more off shore) they can see an oil derrick?
Venice Beach is ALWAYS packed and you can derricks there.
5428 2018-08-09 14:28:11 Always be on the lookout and watch for leaks or stains from under your car. If you see a constant red oil leak and you have confirmed that your vehicle is the source of, you should have it checked out to see if it’s coming from the transmission or power steering.

5432 2018-08-09 14:27:47 Congratulations on your book. It’s indeed beautiful.  I’ve said this before.  My mother Joan, an artist, colorized large b/w format portraits with oil paints, cotton, trowels and wooden styluses. Thank you again.
5433 2018-08-09 14:27:46 WE saw what the #CONs are like for 9 terrible years! Took large Lib surplus, wasted it in 18 mon, ran up debt & added extra $160B to Nat Debt. Left a crumbling infrastructure & economy based on Oil. And are as anti-democratic &  racist as hell!

5440 2018-08-09 14:26:48 My crappy jeep update: after putting a new oil pan on, and another new oil pan gasket. (Has had new rear main seal, and valve cover gasket last month.) Drove jeep around. No sign of oil caked on everything... YET. We'll see. #jeep #oil
5441 2018-08-09 14:26:39 What year are you referencing and what are the actual volumes?  
Energy East could never deliver oil as cheaply to Irving as a tanker the non-US countries on your list because of the pumping distances. Likely result is a drop in wellhead prices compared to other export pipelines.
5442 2018-08-09 14:26:34 Will - Within the past couple of years, vast new oil fields were discovered off Yemen's coast, with (as yet unproven) reserves that may exceed all of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves. Any chance that this is part of what is driving SA's (and U.S.'s) interference in Yemen?
5443 2018-08-09 14:26:33 A colleague at work also does keto and it's like we are part of a cult. We talk about C8 MCT Oil and avocados. I finally feel understood

5450 2018-08-09 14:26:00 Conquest, Tribute and Trade, by Erlichman, subtitled something about precious metals.

The Quest, Daniel Yergin, about oil- mischief while mining.

There's a new biography of Fugger, about a year old, slim book, gossipy. Mines and Revolution, basically. 

Braudel's stuff (maybe)

5452 2018-08-09 14:25:53 I was at a xmas party with my parents, and the Catholic hosts’ daughter had killed herself. I’m a suicide survivor. The hostess asked if she could pray for me- I said ok, to be polite. She “anointed” me with oil and prayed out loud in front of everyone! I was stunned into silence

5454 2018-08-09 14:25:32 Honourable Minister of Transport, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi said if Buhari 
10years ago was 2009.
• At that time, fuel was N65 per litre., it is N145 now
• A gallon of 'TOTAL 5000W' engine oil was N750 then, it is N4800 now
• Naira was 150 to $1.
• A bag of cement was N900.
5455 2018-08-09 14:25:20 Because the dips in Vancouver and Montreal would rather rely on South Asians economic slaves in the ME to extract their oil, than giving a Canadian a job.
5456 2018-08-09 14:25:16 why was i told my oil change was going to be $80 and here i am paying $130, plus the rude ass guy telling me “i’ll deal with you in a minute” BYE

5458 2018-08-09 14:25:03 They’ll still sell us oil. That’s in their best interest. They will just hand pick things to do to harm CANADA. What a panty waste @JustinTrudeau is that he won’t stand up to this regime on all fronts and support Canadian industry that could supply all oil. #worstPM #Libsmustgo

5463 2018-08-09 14:24:51 Nobody will support Trudeau. He is dumber than a box of rocks.   
Europe is highly dependant on Saudi Arabia for oil supply and... public debt. 
France for example.

5467 2018-08-09 14:24:44 No, I mean happy with top 4.
During Fergie's time, It was enough.
Now look at these oil clubs, you have to buy to genuinely compete.
5468 2018-08-09 14:24:36 What wealth? Have they found oil?

5472 2018-08-09 14:24:17 It was all orchestrated. They needed a way to subsidized oil sands even more, and this was the way to do it.

In return, I send a sample (not sure how US customs allow that, so info necessary) of my mom and dad's homemade olive oil (from Croatia). My mom can vouch for quality as she sits to wait for the oil to be made.

5479 2018-08-09 14:23:27 Email from Honda Auto Service - ATTN: OIL CHANGE OVERDUE.

I fucking guess so. I haven't owned a Honda since - 1989.
5480 2018-08-09 14:23:26 I can recall a former pastor using 3 oil lamps to illustrate his sermon once.  One of them was empty.  One of them, the globe was smutted.  I believe the third one needed the wick to be trimmed.
5481 2018-08-09 14:23:26 Then they won't be able to afford $250/barrel oil either, and they need to leave now before there's 49 states committed to fracking and one state sitting on the long end of the Asian supply line.
5482 2018-08-09 14:23:22 The #Venezuelan right wing opposition is @CIA backed which is doing the work of the oil and gas companies like @ExxonMobil @Chevron & others!

5485 2018-08-09 14:22:46 Arbitrary:  Olive oil, vinegar & lemon and/or lime juice combined tastes better than any other salad dressing to me
5486 2018-08-09 14:22:43 I'm extremely sensitive to drugs. It took me close to 9 years to find the right cocktail. I'm one that has to be on them though. I've never tried CBD oil. I definitely follow a healthy lifestyle the best I can. It all contributes to a better quality of life-its been my experience

5488 2018-08-09 14:22:39 Notes on Fascism: 
In World W II, Ford Motor Co, Firestone and other big US businesses provided Spain’s Fascist dictator, Franco, with trucks, tires, and machine tools. Texaco boss promised Franco all the oil he needed, and then supplied oil to HITLER...just sayin...
5489 2018-08-09 14:22:27 broooooo everytime I come to get an oil change they be trying to get over on me!!! Not today Satan
5490 2018-08-09 14:22:25 What a joke. If The boy child PM does not ban all Saudi oil he really is a paper tiger. He and his useless band need to be voted out. Weak!
5491 2018-08-09 14:22:21 Oil future need to stay above $67.18 to start a new trend.
5492 2018-08-09 14:22:20 Do terra or young living oils and organic coconut oil from Costco. Little oil goes a long way.
5493 2018-08-09 14:22:15 The best way to use baby oil gel:

5505 2018-08-09 14:20:35 Depends on whether the second oil crisis would have killed it. If not that, then certainly the same factors that did in Concorde.
5506 2018-08-09 14:20:25 And BP oil is suing for being used in WD-40 GTFOH!!!!!
5507 2018-08-09 14:20:23 Call me biased (I totally am), but Tom Gunton is nailing the case against the Government of Canada purchasing the #TransMountain pipeline on @CBCEarlyEdition, particularly when there’s other viable options available for moving oil. #KinderMorgan #cdnpoli
5508 2018-08-09 14:20:06 I don't even understand the palm oil! Why does she have it so readily available? Why is she using it to fight?! These are questions I don't ever want to find out the answers to.

5514 2018-08-09 14:19:46 Every state incentivizes for jobs. Oklahoma thinks oil should pay for everything because there are big oil companies based here that sometimes make a lot of money. And the GPT isn’t our only tax. It’s an additional tax beyond what other industries pay.
5515 2018-08-09 14:19:43 The US is really the only thing that can cause the Saudis to change.  If the US cut or boycotted them, they'd reform PDQ to get the gravy train flowing again.  Problem is most oil producing countries have varying levels of sketchiness.

5520 2018-08-09 14:19:19 Canada is a treaty ally and NATO ally, they are our pussy hat.  They pump oil to us and we clean it up.  They're the kind friend we turn to when Mexico wants to make all the cars.

Saudi Arabia is engaging in genocide and doesn't let women speak.

5525 2018-08-09 14:19:05 You can disagree all you want but facts are right there - consumer confidence drives every economic downturn.stock market, money tightening, war demobilization, oil fears, Fed monetary measures, and most recently grifting from S&L, real estate. None of it caused by tax policy.

5529 2018-08-09 14:18:42 Why the heck, considering the steps KSA is taking, should Canada continue to buy their oil?  There are a number of other despotic regimes we can get it from while our own oil is not used due to the cancellation of Energy East.

5535 2018-08-09 14:18:05 Venezuela is not socialist. Nationalizing the oil industry didn’t cause the economic crisis.  The “but Venezuela!!!” pearl clutching is ridiculous.

5561 2018-08-09 14:15:39 Alright so we replaced the radiator fan and my radiator cap there’s plenty of coolant, I know I’m due for an oil change soon but would that cause my car to vigorouslyshake then stop in a cycle and run my car really hot STILL and cause my air to not cool???? Like out of nowhere???
5562 2018-08-09 14:15:33 Straight to Venezuela. So textbook.
To answer your question Canada alone has worked wonders in medicine. You haven't figured out why Venezuela is tanking? Here's a clue. Largest oil resources discovered there. Guess how long our great capitalism has been there setting fire.
5563 2018-08-09 14:15:33 Guess that means good enough to sell oil to lest Canada actually out a pipeline to the east coast in.
5564 2018-08-09 14:15:32 Canada needs to stop buying Saudi oil. It funds the attacks they are making against Canada & their human rights abuses.

5586 2018-08-09 14:13:55 The two volatile keys here are Trump and Kim.While I admire Moon's efforts,I still see Kim bluffing. China doesn't help matters by sneaking oil into NKorea via ship transfers at sea. I think Kim will continue oncourse to stall while getting as much as possible from Moon.
5587 2018-08-09 14:13:53 The USA owns the prince, Trump is pissed at Trudeau for now bowing to his one sided trade plans.

5605 2018-08-09 14:12:57 I had two thought. 1) Apple buys them and drags it out maybe works. 2) Saudi's buy it, shut it down to boost gas powered vehicles usage, sell more oil. Bonus 3) Saud's diversify into electric as capitulation to superior American E&P
5606 2018-08-09 14:12:50 So except for the warm feeling of serving your fellow man, you have no reason to go out and drill for oil. And if someone wants some, you should give it to them freely without checking for credentials. Got it. How is this not slavery?
5607 2018-08-09 14:12:45 Canada's Government stands it's ground against the horrific human rights abusers of this world in-spite of financial ramifications of standing up to oil rich regimes... Our government just sells them more weapons and calls them friends while looking the other way.... :(

5613 2018-08-09 14:12:10 The only impact should be filling up rail cars and shipping it out east as we cut off Saudi oil.

5621 2018-08-09 14:11:21 Only the Maritimes pays for this?  But NFLD produces offshore oil.  Is there no benefit to that?
5622 2018-08-09 14:11:17 Oil is a net contributor to Canada's prosperity....   
Renewable are not profitable. In Germany it's turning really bad....  That's why the Germans need NordStream2.
5623 2018-08-09 14:11:15 IIRC, Saudi has been trying to diversify away from oil, seeing the writing on the wall in regards to renewable prices.

5691 2018-08-09 14:04:56 You need to close the door that you opened with the Ouija Board. But first, you need to annoint yourself with blessed olive oil and put salt around your home and around your parents. ORDER the negative out in the Name of Jesus while you are doing the annointing.

5696 2018-08-09 14:04:27 Norway earns more interest on their dosh from oil, than Scotland's entire budget.  The lies from London are *obviously* imperialist.

THey earn more than double.  Labour DID that just like Thatcher did.  Never a peep fae the Lefties about those lies.  Very odd
5697 2018-08-09 14:04:22 Have to get my oil changed today
5698 2018-08-09 14:04:22 LOL! Gotta love the right and how easily their BS crumbles.  Caitlin Flanagan @CaitlinPacific just exposed herself to @UVA as the fraud she is as she fawns over snake oil salesman @jordanbpeterson in @TheAtlantic A person who cites @prageru as a legitimate source of information.

5700 2018-08-09 14:04:19 I have two probable explanations for you, Oil and more importantly this administration's lack of attention paid toward's human rights violations.
5701 2018-08-09 14:04:11 Agreed! However..... New documentary shows GW surpressed electric automation. He was big with oil companies. Saudi they called him Bandabar Bush.

5706 2018-08-09 14:03:36 I'm tired of the "Data is the oil" talk. You and I don't buy crude oil - we buy gasoline, heating oil, and other refined petro products. We need to put data in context to understand (and manage) its value.

5714 2018-08-09 14:02:53 China went to Russia thats why Russian soybean sales tripled and Iran is selling its oil to Russia as well since trump ended the Iranian deal seems like with everything trump does he betters the Russian economy and weakens the American economy so much winning for Russia
5715 2018-08-09 14:02:47 Nope, these damn politicians and media outlets suffer from a contagious disease known as 'selective hearing.' and 'selective outrage.' They can't be known as terrorist supporters because they've signed multibillion dollar military deals with SA for this very reason. Blood 4 oil!

5720 2018-08-09 14:02:06 All these replies and none mention that SA has the oil. Like the nuke, it is a get-out-of-jail-free card.
5721 2018-08-09 14:02:04 Unfortunately as we are witnessing, there is a huge demand for snake oil on the far right of the spectrum.

When the working class GOP figures out they are supporting wealthy elitists who only care about growing THEIR wealth, snake oil may become unpopular.
5722 2018-08-09 14:02:03 That's fine ... just don't let him near the House committee, or we'll have to watch Nunes massage his balls for half a day before apologizing that he didn't use enough baby oil.
5723 2018-08-09 14:01:54 Western "democracies" align with totalitarian Gulf states because of oil obviously, but also because unaccountable monarchies can carry out the empire's dirty deeds far more easily than a nation that has to maintain the illusion of moral authority by appearing free & democratic.

Please tell me how valuable their oil is to the world & how wrong it is to criticize them? There’s no honor in remaining silent
5733 2018-08-09 14:00:56 You want to get it nice and hot after you put the oil on, until the oil starts to smoke. IIRC that prevents the oil from going rancid. Also, it's really not a big deal to use a little soap on it.

5735 2018-08-09 14:00:50 Existing pipelines can supply up to 80% of Quebec’s requirements with conventional or upgraded oil.  That leaves Irving with a capacity of around 300k bbls/day.  You wouldn’t build a 4400 km pipeline with pumps requiring the power output of a Site C dam for Irving alone.

5751 2018-08-09 13:59:41 Desalination plants are not a magic solution.
They use huge amounts of energy and they change the salinity of coastal water, harming marine habitat.
They work for energy-rich countries in the Persian Gulf who have more oil than water, but would not work on a large scale here

5758 2018-08-09 13:59:01 Its so worthless they keep exploring and finding more oil fields, but even besides that, if it is worthless, Scotland is much more than about oil. We would do fine. Also can you tell me any country's that gained independence from the UK and want back in?

5760 2018-08-09 13:58:41 It was Saudi Islamic extremists, not the government of SA.  MBS and his father, the King, are working to eliminate extremism and reform Islam.  SA is running out of oil.  They are trying to diversify their economy and modernize their country.

5762 2018-08-09 13:58:32 Just like Issa, Nunes was chosen by the GOP to be a pit bull to Democrats and stir things up.  Look at what Issa did to Grey of California.  They both are snake oil salesmen skilled in the art of deception and innuendoes. That’s their job. Why does a party need that to win?

5765 2018-08-09 13:58:20 Not through lack of trying they probably didnt think that buying one with tax dollars was an option. After all as much as they were accused of being too friendly with oil companies they never did hand over 4.5billion to any energy company.
5766 2018-08-09 13:58:14 Summary.. We hate Canada, but as long as you are dumb enough to buy our oil while we boycott everything you sell us, we are happy to take your money!!!
5767 2018-08-09 13:58:12 I am a sausage sizzling in the oil of my failures
5768 2018-08-09 13:57:40 Yes...but, as well, we have to determine why we've never been free with our own trade and our own oil within Canada, within North America for that matter, and establish ourselves against unethical, world oil. There are reasons behind that, I'm sure.

5771 2018-08-09 13:57:20 Are you concerned about how you’ll continue to afford to keep your family warm in the winter with rising oil prices increasing electricity costs? A natural gas system could provide you with a more stable and affordable system.

5787 2018-08-09 13:56:12 I remember when we were going to be an energy superpower with NorthernGateway oil and gas contracts with Asia, Energy East providing oil self sufficiency and European trade, all while still selling to US. Imagine the social programs we could afford.
5788 2018-08-09 13:56:12 trump got caught colluding with russia while trying to get dirt that proved Clinton colluded with russia. If there was an engine that ran on irony, the republican party would put all their oil buddies out of business.

5792 2018-08-09 13:55:48 Canada needs to ban Saudi oil in Canada and replace it with Canadian oil destined for export.
5793 2018-08-09 13:55:46 And yet you are ok with your own tweets that are so partisan..  But hey, seems Saudi Arabia now saying they will still sell Canada their oil. So how about you petition Trudeau Gov to NOT accept oil from this country that tortures and kills people.?

5798 2018-08-09 13:55:32 We are guilty. We never should have been involved in Yemen. 
And to Saudi Arabia, when oil is delegated to the last resort for fuel will have nothing but war. This is their second business.

5825 2018-08-09 13:53:23 Yes, the worst being Andrew Wakefield,  an English snake oil salesman now plying his insidious trade on your side of the pond. Responsible for the huge spike in Measles here in the UK.
5826 2018-08-09 13:53:20 1. Wrong. Largesse? You’re a fool to think there’s such a thing as a free lunch. Esp Britain towards Ireland. £ to Scotland is minuscule compared to its oil wealth. 2. You never heard of ‘A Protestant state for a Protestant people’?Sectarianism was the beating heart of the state.

5829 2018-08-09 13:53:00 If you don't find any shops nearby, were happy to chat with you about CBD oil for pets, we have plenty of community members using our products on their pets, if you would like some links to their experiences let us know 
5830 2018-08-09 13:52:46 I have CBD oil on-order, so looking forward to trying it. I’ve tried turmeric supplements and other natural anti-inflammatories, but no luck yet
5831 2018-08-09 13:52:31 For one thing, Oil is priced and traded in US Dollars. We enforce this and intimidate/threaten/overthrow anyone who tries to stop using the US dollar for this, because I think USD would crash hard if another currency was used instead. If USD crashed it would affect others 2/2
5832 2018-08-09 13:52:15 Why not up the oil intake from the other exporters or, better, reduce our oil usage by that 15%. They have frozen all trade so it just makes sense you give them what they want.

Luckily for Bolivia they don’t have a valuable natural resource like Oil.

Oh wait! Lithium comes from Bolivia!

Oh shit, they’re doomed!
5837 2018-08-09 13:51:47 Oil exports to Canada will continue. We import only 15%  of Saudi oil.
5838 2018-08-09 13:51:42 So wouldn't @JustinTrudeau ace in the hole be to announce the restart of Energy East, so that we would no longer have to rely on Saudi oil? However that may piss off many of the radical Saudi Imams that he cherishes, so never mind!

5853 2018-08-09 13:49:51 understand the resentful bankers went to Venezuela with their power others gave and  collapsed them telling investors to pull out,  as oil  was their main trade. Why Venezuela fell for it and  didn't just become self sufficient is beyond me,  it has  nothing to do with socialism
5854 2018-08-09 13:49:50 The day when Saudi Arabia runs out of oil is the day it will begin to collpase into a battleground of violent medieval tribes just like what it was before oil boom.

Eastern Canada should get oil from Alberta not Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
5856 2018-08-09 13:49:43 Oil is a speculation of investors led blindly. Canada is divided by a evil hell in the ground. Renewables are the future yet fools crave oil.

5870 2018-08-09 13:48:44 Why the heck do we buy oil from Saudi Arabia when we can easily produce our own. Frustrating.

5895 2018-08-09 13:47:22 This must be dreadfully confusing for Trudeau and gang. On the one hand they admire and like and admire dictatorial regimes, on the other hand Canadians don’t. We don’t “need” Saudi business or oil or students, but Trudeau does like to play Mr. Globalist. We do need US trade.
5896 2018-08-09 13:47:20 And everyone thinks Canada has “dirty oil”.
5897 2018-08-09 13:47:18 I’ve used just a regular target brand one. But I destroyed it putting tea tree oil in it lol. So if you plan on adding oil scents I wouldn’t recommend that brand.
5898 2018-08-09 13:46:48 Actually it would be a good time to start the energy east project. Reliance on foreign oil needs to be eliminated. We cannot immediately go to a totally green society but we should work in that direction while adapting as best we can to a changing political landscape.

Good question to ask is - why is it hotter where you extract the most oil.

5910 2018-08-09 13:46:00 Better to use up their reserves while they still have oil but have a backup plan (pipelines) should either side decide to cut the flow.

5919 2018-08-09 13:45:19 Yeah, but they’ll still sell us their oil cause at the end of the day KSA doesn’t want to lose any market share. Canada must complete pipelines to be not only oil self sufficient but an exporter to the world, not just the USA.
5920 2018-08-09 13:45:17 Because back in the 80’s some government fat cats and oil company CEO’s wanted to line their wallets so they came up with the idea of selling our oil to be refined out of country then sell it back at a inflated cost. We should be supplying Canada first with oil and stock piling.

5925 2018-08-09 13:44:20 We actually import oil for use in both the refining/extraction processes and also for refinement on a regional basis.

IOW it's complicated.
5926 2018-08-09 13:44:19 It should and hopefully opens up Canadian eyes for the need to ship oil, via pipeline, to both the Pacific & Atlantic coasts.

5953 2018-08-09 13:42:21 I agree. That's like Norway who drills for oil while pushing their country away from oil at the same time. They know it's bad, "but the money..."
5954 2018-08-09 13:42:17 What happens to gas prices if Saudi Arabia cuts off oil exports to Canada? Great! Canada can buy it from the US! Is very near!
5955 2018-08-09 13:42:06 Market didn't like the new Apache deal $APA... down almost 7%. #oil #oott
5956 2018-08-09 13:42:06 Please drop this oil ASAP
5957 2018-08-09 13:42:00 My thoughts exactly. But it should. Amongst all the pipeline angst the fact that Canada has to import oil from Saudi gets buried.
5958 2018-08-09 13:42:00 Russia should spike oil prices and ensure Trump's defeat in #midterms Then you Israeli neocons will learn a lesson.
5959 2018-08-09 13:41:56 And Cruz is gonna break out the knee pads and gargle some olive oil and do what Trump wants him to do, cuz when you’re a properly broken punk you do what daddy says.
5960 2018-08-09 13:41:54 This 'unconstrained approach' is simply a scam to avoid oil gaining value by feeding algos with false data...
5961 2018-08-09 13:41:46 hahaha oil, club saver
5962 2018-08-09 13:41:41 It take forever to get a oil change  they need to hurry up
5963 2018-08-09 13:41:41 I'm in love with oil again :))
5964 2018-08-09 13:41:25 It was hypocritical to have killed Energy East, to hurt Canada’s abilities to be energy self-sufficient, and to continue to import “bloody” Saudi oil. (This is to say nothing of Coderre’s annual sewage dump into the St. Lawrence.)
5965 2018-08-09 13:41:20 Do you think it is good that #Turkey keeps buying oil from #Iran?

5969 2018-08-09 13:40:59 This is true. Too often a case of "we've got to do something..." <enter charlatan> "this is something!" ... "let's do it". As long as there are snake oil buyers, there'll be snake oil merchants

5973 2018-08-09 13:40:48 I dead been here for almost 2 hrs getting a oil change. My appointment was at 8. NTB needs to get it together.
5974 2018-08-09 13:40:42 The UK government is trying to get rid of Putin so that through a puppet Russian government it can control the gas and oil and, of course, make loads of money at the expense of the Russian people.

5976 2018-08-09 13:40:24 We are not strangers to changes in economic cycles especially with a 1 commodity dependent one like ours, the question here is “has Kemi’s management of the economy post the oil shock demonstrated the sort of competence needed in a 3rd world country like ours?
5977 2018-08-09 13:40:22 I remember the last time I 'played'. I had an acre of space all game. When they finally passed to me I remembered why as I have the turning circle of an oil tanker and the first touch of an iceberg.

5985 2018-08-09 13:40:04 Oil is all they have.  They contribute nothing to society. Just have woman the right to drive cars but you still get stoned to death for speaking up.  They are 100 years or more behind normal civilization.
5986 2018-08-09 13:40:02 No. The Earth doesn't constantly produce oil. I know there's some teachers in this country that need be fired. Smh

5988 2018-08-09 13:40:02 Looking to adjust a few things here. Taking profit on $PXX and cutting some heavy oil exposure. Will look to focus on $BTE, $SU & $CVE instead. Also taking the axe to $BFD and selling for a loss. Want to redeploy that capital into something else, likely their neighbor $BTR.
5989 2018-08-09 13:39:59 I seriously hope that pressure is brought on Irving Oil @irvingoil to find a replacement for Saudi oil. I hear Nigeria is ramping up production and might be a better fit until we achieve energy independence..

5998 2018-08-09 13:39:22 If you have sensitive skin more simple products might work better than big brand cleansers.. they do for me. Alcohol, Witch Hazel, Regular dove bar soap, African black soap, raw organic coconut oil or Shea butter for a moisturizer  works like a charm

Boycott Saudi Oil!
All Saudi oil is coming through a single New Brunswick refinery. All Saudi oil imported into Canada in 2017 and 2018 came through New Brunswick, : The Irving Oil refinery imported $1.8 billion of Saudi oil!

6023 2018-08-09 13:37:03 Meanwhile, Canada and Saudi Arabia have major beef. You won’t hear a thing from the Trump administration. Human rights is an issue for the Trump administration in North Korea, but not in Saudi Arabia. Maybe it’s all the oil money invested and all the weapons we’ve sold them.

6034 2018-08-09 13:36:04 To be fair. I don't really want @RealAlexJones banned. I want people like him to be known for being the scumbags snake oil salesmen they are. Only consolation that comes from it is the kekistanis will cry bloody tears. Kekfrog tears make good bong water.

6045 2018-08-09 13:34:49 Total hypocrisy on both sides. Canada is concerned about human rights in Saudi Arabia but not enough to stop selling them arms. Saudi Arabia is deeply offended by Canadian interference but not enough to stop selling us oil.
6046 2018-08-09 13:34:49 The conversation about using Canadian oil in Canada is 30-40 years too late.

6048 2018-08-09 13:34:48 New Brunswick gets $1.874 billion in equalization payments yet imports nearly $3.75 billion a year in Saudi oil  shipments to the Irving oil facility.   Crude Oil comes from railroad or Oil tankers where are the protesters like @MikeHudema  ?@BrianGallantNB @jkenney
6049 2018-08-09 13:34:45 You make some great points. I just wanted to show @Liz_Cheney that things are changing and how people are going about it. We do use oil, we can transition to less or none at all. We are all a part of the problem and it will take us all to change our energy dependencies.

6100 2018-08-09 13:30:18 So if it helps any, there is a natural essential oil product from Young Living called Purification.  Best stuff going - both repellent & for itch.  Take it with me everywhere. Has worked on Canadian & South American Mosquitos equally well.  Also small bottle that travels easily.
6101 2018-08-09 13:30:18 Круто вышло

6106 2018-08-09 13:29:50 It's not. Oil prices are set by the market. Stop being stupid.

6110 2018-08-09 13:29:22 @chrisjparrish afternoon Chris.

They've kicked me from my old account. I was in on MTR with you guys about 3 months ago. Nice rise we got too.

Just to let you know the next one I've seen with 50%+ potential is Amerisur. Lots of cash and high margins on the oil they produce.
6111 2018-08-09 13:29:20 I need to get up & go get my oil changed

6115 2018-08-09 13:29:09 Been doing coconut oil instead of MCT oil in my coffee and it really does help keep hunger away. I do miss the benefits of the pure MCT, though. Might alternate days between the two.
6116 2018-08-09 13:29:07 Yeah absolutely. It’s because i seal my hair with regular castor oil and my skin can’t handle that shit at all. But also — its the only thing that seals moisture in my hair for long periods of time (aka when I leave twists in) 
6117 2018-08-09 13:28:55 Well when you do, let us know! We have some wanna-be chefs in our office who are always curious to test out different concoctions and recipes! Have you noticed a difference since adding the oil to your coffee?
6118 2018-08-09 13:28:47 He says leaky pipeline over and over, if it was that leaky why would it still be giving us oil and wouldn't that be in Canada's interest to get a new one built? What a idiot..

6127 2018-08-09 13:27:52 It uses heat from air to cook food. You can find one for $50/$60. You don’t have to use any oil or anything to fry the food in. Way healthier.
6128 2018-08-09 13:27:49 Why are we stil buying oil from Saudi Arabia?? That’s how crazy this is. We have an unlimited supply in Alberta, we need to start getting smart start making the right moves.

6136 2018-08-09 13:27:20 Climate Denial is purely an Investment Strategy. It’s market manipulation to allow holders of oil & coal related investments, to “sell high” & then “buy low” undervalued renewables & greener portfolios. This then allows the wealthiest class to maintain & grow wealth.
6137 2018-08-09 13:27:15 You are being ironic. The biggest fighter against anti Semitism and racism is Jeremy Corbyn. That’s why it feels to me that we are living in the upside down just now. Watson disingenuous appears to be conciliator but actually throws oil on the fire.

6144 2018-08-09 13:26:49 But it should
Canada should not buy 1 more drop of oil outside of our borders. We could easily be energy self-sufficient it's the current Gov't that is in the way of our own success

6158 2018-08-09 13:25:23 IF oil was trading at +$150/barrel, and the kingdom's finances were flowing like a Wakandan Vibranium Freight Train then maybe Saudi Arabia would consider taking down a chunk of a LBO for a billionaire's cash burning vanity project.
6159 2018-08-09 13:25:21 The guys tend to eat quite some peanutbutter in combo with nuts and seeds, a lot of olive oil on their salad and we make a coconut yoghurt as well. I cannot eat a lot of peanut butter, so I make a coconut-almond-cacao milk as bf, salad w tempeh lunch and nuts as snack :)

6165 2018-08-09 13:24:33 The US, Israel, Russia and Saudi have decided to carve the middle east up according to their own plans. The UK is just a vassal of the US now, and Canada is a threat to the US and Saudi oil monopoly. Canada is about to get cut out of this game, just like Iran and Venezuela.
6166 2018-08-09 13:24:28 But could easily have been used for Eastern Canada instead of Saudi oil. You oppose everybpipeline in Canada but are fine with using imported oil
6167 2018-08-09 13:24:27 Which will never happen regardless of who is in power! The US relies on KSA to denominate their oil sales in US dollars (the petrodollar). If KSA decides to move away from this, it will greatly effect the US economy....no US administration will ever abandon or criticize KSA

6206 2018-08-09 13:20:49 We can keep things in perspective. All that's happened is Canada made a mild statement, and Saudi Arabia used it as a window to flex what it thinks is muscle by making a slew of impotent gestures. No need for international involvement if oil supply remains unaffected.
6207 2018-08-09 13:20:40 I liken today's climatologist, to the nineteenth century snake oil salesman.
6208 2018-08-09 13:20:28 The 1st mover might be Switzerland (into EEA, already EFTA).

6213 2018-08-09 13:19:49 Sure, whatever you say. Then go to Germany. They don't have oil but the quality of life is still much better than in the UK because they aren't obsessed with low taxes and they fund their public services.

6232 2018-08-09 13:18:10 We unfortunately can’t do this with Trump in power. The Saudis would just tell him that they are fighting “Iranian militants” and he will fully support him.

6242 2018-08-09 13:17:00 Why would we buy their oil?

6257 2018-08-09 13:15:34 Except Saudis can screw Canada in other more nefarious ways, like jacking up oil supply to lower oil prices. Let’s not be too glib in this diplomatic spat.
6258 2018-08-09 13:15:27 What Saudi Arabia and Qatar Does with their oil makes me wonder if it's Coconut oil that Nigeria has been Selling. What a Country!!!
6259 2018-08-09 13:15:18 I know the warm season is around the corner because my hands slide through my hair when I apply the coconut oil.

6261 2018-08-09 13:15:05 I just made an appointment for an oil change and immediately after hanging up the phone thought "yeah I'm gonna forget that" but made no effort to put it in a calendar or set a reminder. this is how I choose to live

6278 2018-08-09 13:14:04 So the Saudi’s have a problem with everything Canada, but they are happy to sell us oil still. 

This whole dispute is just dumb and I really think everybody will just come out a loser.
6279 2018-08-09 13:14:00 Have you read John Jappy’s articles yet? Please do so and you will change your mind. Btw he used to be a high flyer in WM civil service. What he found out changed his mind as well when he saw the real figures in 1968 before oil came on board.

6299 2018-08-09 13:11:59 Ya well Harper wasn't buying oil from Iran and selling them arms shipments either. The Saudi's have millions if dollars worth of investments they are pulling because Trudeau can't use proper diplomacy. What an idiot!

6359 2018-08-09 13:06:58 From the article:
"Soaring demand for roughnecks, laborers and truck drivers in the Permian Basin of West Texas/southeast New Mexico is forcing oil producers to offer bonuses and higher pay to attract employees". 
Seems to me this is as "good a problem" as an industry can have.

6363 2018-08-09 13:06:52 Corn and soybeans are a great food source, but if ethanol and biodiesel can't survive without government $ub$idie$ continuing with those fuel additives makes no sense. Oil is plentiful and cheap and electric vehicles are on the horizon.

6374 2018-08-09 13:05:59 Canada doesn't have the economic strength to reject Saudi oil, so the farce will go on for a while.

6384 2018-08-09 13:04:56 No bro, at Sundowns yes because the machine there is well oiled. At Chiefs thou things are different, there was not fluidity. New coach ought to service the malfunctioning machine and then oil it. He's still using same old rusty machine. Not brave enough to put new parts.

6388 2018-08-09 13:04:34 No surprise there. Oil runs the world.
6389 2018-08-09 13:04:28 Variable prices in oil compared to last administration and this government has been able to manage the economy well.

6391 2018-08-09 13:03:55 The other projects were needed and will serve the whole of Calgary. Right now all levels of governments are being told to stop spending, Canada is in a fragile recovery after the last drop oil prices. Companies are keeping profits and not rehiring, now is not the time for a party
6392 2018-08-09 13:03:46 They have been in Gaza what 13 yrs now. Beach front property on med, gas and oil off shore, they could be making a real nation. Why do they let their govt focus time and money on attacking Israel?

6453 2018-08-09 12:57:58 Neutral - so you see no material impact of China starting to remonetize gold w/ option of gold bar payment for oil in Shanghai in September.

#China imports 9M bbl/d oil. If 1M bbl/d settle in gold bar payment, that equals 20% of annual gold mine supply.

6508 2018-08-09 12:52:00 Did you know oxygen, light, and heat are enemies of olive oil? It is best to store olive oil in a cool, dark place away from light and heat, which will speed up oxidation, causing the oil to become rancid faster.

6511 2018-08-09 12:51:45 i know i’m adulting, i just took my car to get a oil change when usually my daddy does it 
6512 2018-08-09 12:51:43 There’s always India? They have the highest Per Capita college degrees I read just the other day. Who needs the Trump backers of the world anyways? We go green and we won’t need their oil.
6513 2018-08-09 12:51:42 Right - so we don’t agree with Saudi human rights - Trudeau says we’re always going to stand for human rights...

But we’ll continue buying their oil and supporting their economy.

Last I checked...Alberta has a pretty good record on human rights?  Ethical oil anyone?

6524 2018-08-09 12:51:02 Venezuela's problem isn't socialism but the US economic war against it and a low oil price.  The oil price gone down by more than 50% from 2014 and with it gone down the economy of Venezuala.

6549 2018-08-09 12:48:42 I’m sure they miscalculated reaction, otherwise they wouldn’t post it. If Trudeau respected himself and Canadians he should buy Saudis’ share of oil from someone else, better yet built a pipeline. Russian media report Saudis don’t plan to stop oil sales to Canada.

6568 2018-08-09 12:46:55 I Tweeted yesterday about making what sometimes is called a hydrocarbon. I intended to state how an oil is made. C6H12 is a sugar. Gasoline's chemical name is Octane that is C8 and has eight carbons with hydrogens. I believe the production of both gasoline and sugar is similar.
6569 2018-08-09 12:46:53 Not really seeing dip buyers coming into oil this morning w/ crude flat. After a 4% down move yesterday, you'd think there'd be a stronger interest to pick up some black gold. That's telling.

6576 2018-08-09 12:45:38 On the other hand.......

The recent Saudi spat is all the more reason to build those East and West pipelines sooner rather than later. 

So eventually we can stop importing Saudi Oil!!

The sooner we become energy self-sufficient the better our economy will become.
6577 2018-08-09 12:45:31 It always has. Remember the oil embargo in the 70’s? biggest economic damage to the US by any country.
6578 2018-08-09 12:45:17 Powerful? Their power comes from oil and weapons. Lots of oil around these days and their fighter jets can't make it past the coast of Africa.
6579 2018-08-09 12:45:14 No Canada doesn't need #SaudiArabia oil. We do have our own. Our priorities are not spending taxpayers $$$ in Canada. We believe in outsourcing taxpayers $$$ to the lowest bidder. #ParodyGovtOfCanada #ParodyCabinet

6583 2018-08-09 12:44:53 so part of the deal between Trump and Putin was this, divert oil from China?

6587 2018-08-09 12:44:46 IMO Canada did cherry pick Saudi as the one to take a hard stance on b/c it will have a negligible effect on our economy if the relationship sours. But the fact that Trudeau is still allowing Saudi oil imports tells you all you need to know.
6588 2018-08-09 12:44:35 Let's pray that my coconut oil lipstick is wearable and that matte colour won't dry my lips anymore

6591 2018-08-09 12:44:11 We should do something about buying blood oil.  Albertans are nice ppl, or does Trudeau prefer blood oil shipped by super tankers and train?
6592 2018-08-09 12:44:09 I think other countries as well should think about their dealings with SA.

Only realistic limitation is where they will get their oil. Buy Canadian oils if we can get it shipped out in sufficient and efficient volumes.

6597 2018-08-09 12:43:47 Oil is a cyclical business, and the one thing you don't want to happen is for oil prices to dive while being highly levered. Chevron's sound balance sheet is a huge deal for investors looking to avoid risk. #business
6598 2018-08-09 12:43:37 Yes that is it. Saudi money & oil. The same reason the US covered up Saudi complicity on the 9/11 attacks. Its sad all those obsessed with the lobbying between Trump & Russia ignore countries that actually have some control of the US. I'm dreading the blow back from this evil.

6604 2018-08-09 12:43:15 Why on earth is Canada importing oil from anyone??

6745 2018-08-09 12:29:35 And of course that assumes oil prices don't drop and costs don't escalate like on Hebron.  Equity stakes have huge risks and the return is a lot less than its backers claim, just like MF.  No suprise.  Equity backers are/were also, generally, huge MF supporters.

6767 2018-08-09 12:27:17 The ONLY reason America makes the constant mistakes it does in the middle east, decade after decade, is because we are willing slaves to big oil and refuse to invest in any alternative that is not immediately as profitable and easy. Until that changes, nothing else will.

6788 2018-08-09 12:25:24 Some people think oil royalties will do.  Well the royalties are needed to pay for hospitals etc and as it is we are still short $2 billion in cash ever year in the annual budget.  So royalties are not going to cut it.

6797 2018-08-09 12:24:34 Well, gee, isn;t that nice. Now I have a question for our Gov. IF we are opposing Saudi Arabia stand on human rights & their apparent abuse of them, WHY are we going to continue to buy oil from that country. Or is our opposing these abuses only as long as does not cause us harm.

6861 2018-08-09 12:16:52 now why would they cut off oil shipments.... golden goose... not like canada has its own oil, that could be used and processed in a much cleaner way that they do in SA.   would be nice tho, if the media and govt. would tell us the real reason for the "dispute".

6866 2018-08-09 12:16:24 If only there was some internal Canadian source for oil. Maybe then we wouldn’t be so concerned with what KSA thinks. Energy East would reduce if not eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.

6928 2018-08-09 12:08:42 I'd be interested to know too. My guess would be that we don't have enough and the oil from the Saudis is cheap. If the Second Iraq War taught us anything, the US relies on oil from the Middle East too.
6929 2018-08-09 12:08:40 .@GOP has been grooming & enabling @saudiarabia for decades, #BigOil has established its #Toxic pipeline.

6933 2018-08-09 12:08:20 I'm sure they can, while the oil flows. So hey man, good for you you like your government's toddler-like tantrum. I personally just hope for you and your fellow citizen's sake that one day you are allowed to think and express your own opinion without the risk of being tortured.

6936 2018-08-09 12:08:09 Nope. Way before the discovery of oil.
The Middle East has been an unstable battleground ruled by despots since biblical times. It has neve been stable.
The idea that the 2nd Iraq war transformed the Middle East from a peaceful, ordered region into chaos is fanciful.
6937 2018-08-09 12:07:58 It DOES work for epilieptic seizures. A friend in Ohio has a son that is autistic and epilieptic. He had a seizure last week. 4 drops of cannabis oil in his mouth and 30 seconds later......seizures stopped completely.
6938 2018-08-09 12:07:58 !!! Can see how the sourness of the dosa might work there. But the main reason to eat dosa is to get the crisp gingelly oil taste + coconut chutney IMHO so I would probably not try the avocado.
6939 2018-08-09 12:07:32 wish i had a man who would take my car to get it cleaned out & the oil changed while i’m gone.. but fuck having a fucking cheater, liar, and narcissist in your life making u miserable 24/7.

6951 2018-08-09 12:05:46 Top of the hour: OIL continues consolidation above 20MA. A break above 67.17 would be confirmation higher.
GOLD 1H holds below triple top, to hold above 50MA today would HOLD new bullish developing trend.

6953 2018-08-09 12:05:39 If you want to go on about oil money then support your local home town club then you won’t have to get involved in any of these issues will you  
6954 2018-08-09 12:05:11 They want to attack Canada but still want us to buy their oil. Trudeau should end trade with them.

6956 2018-08-09 12:05:04 When those barrels of oil are attached to a murdering terroristic regime, they SHOULD be out of the marketplace. The only way to stop a bully - that’s Iran BTW - by paying them? DJT is right on this.

6960 2018-08-09 12:04:33 Yeah, that's not good.  I had the same thing happen, and coolant leaked into the oil in my Jeep.  Ended up blowing a two inch hole out the side of my motor

Because they allow America to take the oil and give the arms.

this may sound ridiculous but for shampoo i use baking soda + coconut oil + *castor oil* + 10 drops of peppermint oil. sulfate-based shampoos just make my hair feel like crap hahaha...surprisingly it works wonders for me haha

7095 2018-08-09 11:48:16 Only peak oil (started 2005) will do the trick to slow down all economic activities. In 2011-2014 QE1-3 stacked US shale oil on top of conventional production plateau. There will be no such solution when the US shale oil peak happens. A Middle East war would have a similar effect

7138 2018-08-09 11:42:45 We don't need your oil or want it, should be stopped immediately and also kick your kids, your medical staff out, done

- Heat oil in periuk. Tumis bawang merah putih kisar (or chop) proceed with lemongrass then cili kisar.
- Add little serbuk kunyit 
- Add tamarind juice
7141 2018-08-09 11:42:26 Maybe they figured out fracking in the US for quality oil is a lot quicker, easier & cheaper than spending billions building production facilities for a product which can only be refined at a very limited # of US refineries,  barely moves without lots of diluent & is discounted?

7144 2018-08-09 11:42:17 I remember the 70's. Employed meant full time and you could live on what you earned. The inflation due to a massive oil price hike was the problem but totally ignored. No one had to give birth in a toilet because they were frightened of the sack.
7145 2018-08-09 11:42:07 I dunno what you mean by psychological warfare in this context but Fox News lies to our citizens every night. Oil Companies committed a crime against humanity for decades withholding Climate Change studies. The Government itself lied to our population to start a war.

7199 2018-08-09 11:36:06 Q: my oil was a little low (i’m sorry car!!) and they called me & asked if i wanted to do an “oil flush” as well to pick up the gunk in it but they wanted almost $200 so i said hell no & it kinda sounded scammy, is it a legit thing?
7200 2018-08-09 11:35:59 I have to break my “no rap before 12” beliefs for today. I gotta drive to the 2-5 after this oil change and I need something to keep me awake

7219 2018-08-09 11:33:50 Lol... Canada has plenty of its own oil. And last time we checked there are plenty of places selling oil. Saudi Arabia can keep its oil. Trust me nobody here cares.

7221 2018-08-09 11:33:22 That’s why many are saying this is an opportunity to re-examine many things , including refining our own oil. The Regime showed it’s true face in time for Canada to adjust and other others to re-evaluate investing in Saudi Arabia, the prince miscalculated his power.
7222 2018-08-09 11:32:53 Use some hair tunic. If it's too dry you might need an oil based product to tame it. Use a hair dryer and your hands to get it the shape you want :)
7223 2018-08-09 11:32:44 Long story short, they were factoring in future revenues of oil and gas in their books..  The same thing you're telling me that the trillion dollar valuation is based on future prospects

7743 2018-08-09 10:18:18 1. I appreciate your spirit. Keep it up. Here's what happened. In 2014, oil price collapsed from $110/barrel to $46. This abrupt drop shocked the financial system; Nigeria was not the only nation that suffered, #Russia, #SaudiArabia, etc., suffered. Dollar prices rose sharply....

I guess the quality of water maybe be a bit different since the kitchen is subject to more outsider factors that affect its very being, however, the effect is very undetectably subtle. For example the tap filter can carry remnants of oil vapor.

7747 2018-08-09 10:17:58 Benefit of bath salts is that they help detoxify our skin. Warm water opens our pores, allowing the minerals in your bath salts to deeply cleanse our skin. Bathing in a solution of warm water and bath salts will work to draw out impurities, pollution, oil and dirt from the skin.
7748 2018-08-09 10:17:55 You need some really lovely moisturiser in there! I know it seems counter productive but you are stripping your skin raw mate & that’s causing the grief, I would get a balm cleanser instead of the charcoal and get a nice oil or moisturiser (or both if your budget allows) instead

7842 2018-08-09 10:06:01 government policy is to exploit all the UK ‘indigenous’ energy reserves (ignoring wind, tidal, solar etc.)& to support, what I think, is an unnecessary prolonged transition from coal and North Sea gas to land based Fracking of shale gas and oil extraction...

7875 2018-08-09 10:00:02 Yesterday #WallStreet closed with little change, weighed down by the drop in the #oil sector, the sharp fall in crude oil and the industrial values affected by the tension of the trade war.

7885 2018-08-09 09:58:42 Also, in the real world, energy IS associated with locations, and energy can be transferred from one location to another (e.g. oil pipelines, batteries, coal). I think it is perfectly acceptable to start with a simplified idea (that something called energy is stored in coal)...

7895 2018-08-09 09:57:03 Canadian refineries import about 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day of Saudi Arabian crud.

Canada exports 3.5 million barrels per day to the US alone.

We don’t need ‘reassurance’ from Saudi Arabia. We need to stop buying oil from them.
7896 2018-08-09 09:56:44 Thursday! Asian markets closed mixed, European trading is mixed, futures are up & crude oil pretty flat. Have a good day!
7897 2018-08-09 09:56:41 Re: oil.
Engineers & mngmt always had been from coastal Syria. Tiny local qualified manpower eventually did their best to flee IS zones.
So during IS control oil infrastructure had been bombed out, abused and eventually production dropped to ~15K barrels/day.

7907 2018-08-09 09:54:01 Yes I think it is to do with UVA / UVB rays? Some screens block UVA but not UVB. I know there is more to it than that though. I avoid lunchtime sun and use @WeledaUK suncream and Sea Buckthorn oil is excellent as an aftersun.
7908 2018-08-09 09:53:57 The technology of the kerosene lantern is wonderful. The kerosene oil in its south-southern tank is sucked up by the wick and used to generate fire in its south central area resulting in heat and smoke in its chimney in its top northern compartment. Isn't that truly wonderful?

7962 2018-08-09 09:44:33 I have been to Saudi Arabia- dreadful place. I found the experience shocking and if I never go there again it will be too soon. Can’t wait for their oil to run out however only their poor will suffer as the money will be safely stashed away somewhere.

8038 2018-08-09 09:34:05 Thanks - makes sense. It might harder to source the gold to restock the ETF than previous up-legs - if Eastern demand doesn't drop as much as usual e.g. if Iran has bought gold forward contracts with the proceeds of oil sales to China and actually takes delivery so to speak.

8055 2018-08-09 09:29:58 Good wheeze- I shd Hv tried that! Needless to say, I did not inflict cod liver oil on my own children. Actually now reminds me that we then had some capsules whose name escapes me, but wch hd a loathsome after taste.
8056 2018-08-09 09:29:31 that looks YUM @DafsKitchen , what olive oil did you use? We'd love you to try ours next time!  :D
8057 2018-08-09 09:29:13 set aside an empty jar of pasta sauce for potential use later down the line and today I was stressing about how to deal with leftover fry oil bc I had to use the same (aka our only) pot for something else and found and used the jar.

We do not want to repeat, the US government must remain firmly in place and not allow any currency to enter Iran. Oil and banking sanctions must be fully implemented

8290 2018-08-09 08:43:12 In "Macgyver" season 2 episode 2, the episode was about oil pipeline explosions in Nigeria. I have no problem with Western Media using my country but come on,  first off the had this briefing where they said Nigeria was at the bring of civil war and the country was talking apart.

8292 2018-08-09 08:42:50 As the BBC said though. It’s good for export...

No real mention of the impact to everyone given that oil for example is priced in $ so fuel, transport costs, etc will go up.

8298 2018-08-09 08:41:58 I'm going with "business decision" .... Oil doesn't care about politics. Why make cheap US oil more expensive when a lot of your independent refining sector is already struggling? 
8299 2018-08-09 08:41:54 KSA except for the Saudi oil facility provided to us in 1999 post atomic blasts sanctions never stepped out of its way to help us. Same facility was denied by KSA during Musharaf era. ‘Close ties’ is an overused term. As they say ‘no friends only national interests’ go Pakistan!!

8303 2018-08-09 08:41:04 So economy is lame on all four - no revenues from oil to restore agriculture (which have to be restructured for sane irrigation methods and use of drought resistant breeds). No revenues from agriculture exports to rebuild oil infrastructure. 
Makes a very robust vicious circle.
8304 2018-08-09 08:40:51 They have well past the peak oil mark. Canada has not. So...meh I say.
8305 2018-08-09 08:40:49 i usually get my oil changed every 6-ish months, although lately my car is now the family car so it’s gonna need to be done more, but there have been times where my filter is genuinely dirty. but thank you for the advice. if they say it needs changed i’ll look at it first.
8306 2018-08-09 08:40:49 I look forward to the day that oil will be a minor commodity and Saudi Arabia has zero influence in the world.

8321 2018-08-09 08:38:51 I guess just use water instead even if you have oily skin. Scrubbing to much can actually make your skin more oily because it damages the skin barrier making it produce more oil. Water will just removes some of the oil and dirt and at least not make it worse.

8427 2018-08-09 08:18:58 An extremely expensive, unsustainable solution has a better profit margin that a pretty expensive sustainable one. Same reason oil wins out over solar. (Also icebergs jump over, awkwardly, problem of how to deal with desal brine wastewater.)

We should focus on building hydroelectric dam and get electric cars so we don't need oil.

8435 2018-08-09 08:17:04 Inflation just like GDP growth is a product of... poor economic mgmt. First time in 2-1/2 years that we hit below 6.5% & half % point is big time! Blame it on oil price, weak peso, short supply of rice & sugar but at the end of the day it all boils down to gov't ability to react.
8436 2018-08-09 08:16:54 Also I have this vitamin thing I use for my hair to reduce frizziness and heat protection etc. argan oil by ogx is the bomb dot com legit their leave in conditioner and shampoo and conditioner are heavenly !!

8441 2018-08-09 08:15:46 Girl did you blow dry it first or let it dry naturally ? Sometimes in my hair which is naturally very curly- reducing frizziness depends on how you let it dry and did they recommend a particular shampoo ? You should try oil masks the night before you wash it, really helps
8442 2018-08-09 08:15:46 I had the same thing with lithium wire not too long ago! Ended up having to do the transfer to a jar of mineral oil in an argon glove bag

8444 2018-08-09 08:15:38 #AST @BrokermanDaniel, you made an offer to help s/holders, it was thrown back in your face. You have the contacts, you know good oil men who could save whats left of the mess, maybe time to make that offer again! This company needs to be run by industry experts, not accountants
8445 2018-08-09 08:15:32 Birds of the same feather flock together. You call a thief a father & leader because you’re one. Ask IBB where is the $12 billion oil windfall? When a continent is constantly ruled by animals you get a jungle where he who steals the most can survive & flourish.
8446 2018-08-09 08:15:31 They are hypocrites who sold their birth right for oil blocs and wells. They are the cause of all the problems in the world today especially in Africa. I don't watch BBC and CNN because they are all fake news!

8512 2018-08-09 08:02:33 Turkey becomes Venezuela without the oil
8513 2018-08-09 08:02:17 My recollection is the price a year ago was $45/bbl so 50% increase is conservative. But putting %age quibbles aside, the key point remains that Iran can lose a lot of exports to be no worse off in terms of exchange value while retaining oil reserves
8514 2018-08-09 08:02:14 I wonder what Iran could have that Trump what want to get his hands on. Oh, wait a minute,  that's right oil. Because after all he isn't an oil tycoon at all.

Don't let China start sourcing oil from other countries and give them the freedom to slap even higher tariffs on US exports. We need DJT to keep the pressure on and hammer China where it hurts-oil and resources

8527 2018-08-09 08:00:19 Why does Canada buy Saudi oil?
8528 2018-08-09 08:00:17 It sounds very decadent everywhere else, but tartufo is a local thing, so it's very normal here. You mostly buy it ground up & made into a paste with olive oil as a preservative. A 3 ounce jar is about 4 euros for the good stuff. I've had it grow in my compost bin.
8529 2018-08-09 07:59:23 I mean we supply uk but from the USA and we only have the actual oil no capsules.

8561 2018-08-09 07:52:45 I agree, but I fear the establishment will, as before, crush the truth. They'll never let go until Scotland's natural wealth is depleted beyond restoration, every drop of water has been poisoned by fracking, & every last drop of oil has been sold from under us.

8586 2018-08-09 07:48:58 The agreement was the UK government and oil companies would split decom costs 50/50. Oil companies were also given tax rebates. The problem is those major oil companies want out and new smaller companies can't afford to buy with decom costs. Government needs to do something.

8600 2018-08-09 07:46:35 The other surprise is that eastern Canada (QC&ON) consistently blocks pipelines, (therefore oil) from Alberta, but judges that buying Saudi oil is just fine. Makes no sense environmentally, economically or ethically.
8601 2018-08-09 07:46:23 Well the facts escape you. There are 7x more jobs in renewable right now than fossil fuels. Except they don't get the billions in subsides. In fact Trump signed an exc.

8602 2018-08-09 07:46:21 The rag heads can go f .. themselves. Having oil is not the same as being civilised.
8603 2018-08-09 07:46:19 We're a net importer so it's a bad thing. Oil is in dollars so will be more expensive. I reckon fuel prices will rise (not a bad thing for my viewpoint). I know companies that are hurting already. this will make it worse.

8611 2018-08-09 07:44:47 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.

8700 2018-08-09 07:28:23 The best way to cook kale is to fry it in coconut oil. Makes it easier to slide into the bin
8701 2018-08-09 07:28:09 Thank you... Google and Facebook ARE clearly monopolies, and the danger they pose to the well being of society makes Standard Oil almost benign

8717 2018-08-09 07:25:47 It literally coats your hair with a layer so your hair feels so much healthier and thicker afterwards. Also it’s great because you’re not exposing your crown chakra to any toxins. I just mix like 4 sachets with water and coconut oil and leave it on my hair for like 30 mins

8729 2018-08-09 07:23:39 If you mean the Liberals, you are right. Alberta's myths are self-serving and entrenched despite the fact that Liberal governments have twice bailed out the oil sands. But, the ABNDP is governing in a centrist and pragmatic way.

8731 2018-08-09 07:23:35 Well we'd better have our oil lit in our lamps because the Bridegroom will return and snuff out all this evil for good. I look forward to that day. I hope it's soon.

8738 2018-08-09 07:21:55 Doh! Yeah That’s a powerful spin & the timing with offsetting the possibilities of turning away foreign oil dependence and transitioning to domestic will need support.

This one is especially for dry skin. In a bowl put 3 tbs of coffee and 1 of olive oil. Mix the ingredients and then apply them on your face. Keep it for a few minutes, and then rinse off. When you wipe it out the mask shouldn’t be dry.
8771 2018-08-09 07:18:09 You so realize that we get 65% of our oil from the USA don’t you? And only 9% from the Saudis.

8775 2018-08-09 07:16:45 Iain - wake up! Homosexuality and Islam are like oil and water -they don’t mix. We can tie ourselves into convoluted knots over the finer points or.......we recognise the incompatibility of this archaic creed with a tolerant democracy like Britian’s.

8778 2018-08-09 07:16:08 I would rather Canada take a tiny bit now, than be bullied by SA. They made all their money by ripping the planet off with their oil. There are other investors in the world, not just them. I think we would be better off without them.

8781 2018-08-09 07:15:24 Here's what we know about the oil field reports.

1: Its an offshore site located in Pakistan's EEZ in the Arabian Sea.

2: OGDCL is cooperating with ExxonMobil for exploration.

3: Reserve is located 5000mt deep according to remote sensing analyze.

4: It is said to be big.
8782 2018-08-09 07:14:52 Exxon Mobil has not been existing in Pakistan as an oil & gas exploration company. First time, recently Exxon Mobil has farmed-in as a joint venture partner in Indus Offshore Block G with 25% working interest.

8785 2018-08-09 07:14:47 Saudi oil is cheaper to pull out of the ground.
 It's not locked up in sand or rock like a lot of Canada.

That's why fracking boom towns fade in and out. The price of oil dips too low, it's just not worth the cost of production.

Leave it in the ground for a day like this.
8786 2018-08-09 07:14:45 True 2014.. A lot has happened since then not mentioning the lies about oil production. Scotland's choice is simple: English province OR Independent Nation. My mind has changed since brexit and the vile backlash from Westminster

8801 2018-08-09 07:12:19 not sure about that but he seems to be a reasonable person in press conference plus he got major break through with Exxon Mobil US company for drilling in Indus river delta and chances are oil reserver (if found) are of the magnitude of Kuwait oil reservers

8803 2018-08-09 07:12:13 Interesting. So we reapproach worst point since financial crisis & lows of 30yrs. There’s a case to say ignore pre abolition of exchange controls (79). The rally early 80s driven by excessive monetary squeeze & oil revenues.  Pertinent history then late 80s onwards. 75-110 range

8818 2018-08-09 07:10:50 The Saudis account for a mere 8% of oil imports.  65% comes from the USA. So what’s all this about her going to bat for Albertans that you disagree with? Can’t seem to satisfy you Cons.

8890 2018-08-09 06:56:23 We're selling our oil off, obviously we don't need that badly.

Renewables are producing 27% of the world's energy if I'm not mistaken & that's with a nigh-absolute lack of assistance by world governments, especially the US.

We don't "need" any oil, especially if it kills us.
8891 2018-08-09 06:56:19 That's only in 18 months, imagine how much more it'll be full term and with lack of capacity to provide oil enough by domestic oil rigs.  The #OPEC will not let any other of the 4 big producers ship to USA without a 35% tariff. No sane citizens will #VoteRed in November #basta

8895 2018-08-09 06:55:19 Is that really what you think is a good idea, or one just to get a reaction? Fracking isn't a solution to our energy needs, nor is gas. Shame there was no long term investment in renewables in the 80s with the North Sea oil/gas money
8896 2018-08-09 06:55:10 Iraniane regime is at most a corrupt regime of mullahs and their bandit IRGC mercenaries that protect them to stay in power to steal billions of dollars of oil money and share it among themselves!

Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Iceland have less than 5% of GDP from oil and gas.

8945 2018-08-09 06:44:22 Unfortunately, we have a president who seems focused on lowering that economic level rather than raising it.

Oil prices (which he used to blame) have gone up, but there's no commensurate improvement in the economy.

8964 2018-08-09 06:41:11 It would be nice if you acknowledged that AB’s debt is the result of a) the collapse of oil prices which slashed royalties and, b) a revenue model created by the PCs that relied on royalties for 25% of operating spending. If we taxed like ANY other province we’d have a surplus.

9118 2018-08-09 06:11:48 Whoa #Canada, why are you fighting with #SaudiArabia ???

They’ve got a lot of oil. 

I know they threatened you with a 9/11 style attack because you believe in human rights.

What about the oil though? 

What does the crude have to say?

9120 2018-08-09 06:11:34 Previously oil price declines were met with employee cutbacks, waiting for a rebound in oil prices. THIS time  a minimum (I can name) 21 Foreign oíl companies have either cancelled projects or left Canada despite the rebound in oil prices. Oil activity is up 22% in the USA!
WHAT!
9121 2018-08-09 06:11:22 Things will get very awkward if Saudi Arabia declares war on Canada and attacks your borders. IIRC, as a member of NATO the other nations will join in to defend you and some of the other members do buy Saudi oil/sell them arms.
9122 2018-08-09 06:11:09 I wonder whether the current dispute between Canada and Saudi Arabia has anything to do with the pipelines? "We need Canadian oil to be sovereign over SA." Paranoia?
9123 2018-08-09 06:11:08 That’s interesting to hear, looked like there was a lot of fishing and offshore oil and gas infrastructure which seems to connect up with that.

9145 2018-08-09 06:07:41 Because all land in the state belongs to the State Gov. But since the resources like oil are controlled by FG the state will have to report it to them & get compensated. But the State Gov will compensate you.
9146 2018-08-09 06:06:58 Not that I'm particularly interested in a war with the Saudi's.

...but I don't particularly like the Saudi government, and I'm not all that concerned about trade damage they can do to us since we got our own oil and they don't really trade that much with us.

9155 2018-08-09 06:04:54 To have oil transported to the East Coast, we Settlers need to obtain FN consent for all FNs crossed by the pipeline route, or FN consent for hazardous goods movement across each of their Nations

9184 2018-08-09 06:00:28 Conflict between Japan and the U.S. actually dates back to 1930's. Both nations wanted to gain influential role in Asia, U.S. warned Japan to back off(then allies), Japan was defiant.  

This led to U.S. organizing a embargo on Japan, JPN would've died w/o oil, leading to WWII.

9241 2018-08-09 05:51:41 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
9242 2018-08-09 05:51:37 Which sacrifices?
To keep others in perpetual bondage and enslavement? Do you know the ruthless genocide Britain is committing against Biafra through Nigeria government, because of the Biafra wealth (OIL AND GAS)? Nemesis has caught up with the murderous Britain.

9247 2018-08-09 05:50:50 I was good friends with a fire protection engineer (oil rigs, nuclear, etc.)   He said it was well known that structural steel with sprayed concrete fire protection would stand for 20 minutes in a jet fuel fire and that the responders should have known this. No mystery.

9259 2018-08-09 05:49:13 I LEARNED MORE on Venezuela (if this is true). Allegedly, Chavez' generous social programs that relied on oil exports (when bbl price was high) were TOO generous to point of neglecting expensive vital maintenance of PSVDA (tar oil) equip. Production dropped. /1

9263 2018-08-09 05:48:38 Saudi-Canada dispute will not affect oil supplies: Saudi minister: Saudi Arabia's diplomatic dispute with Canada will not affect state oil firm Aramco's clients in Canada, the country's energy minister said.
9264 2018-08-09 05:48:38 My point was to critique Fabian pro-imperialist 'socialism', not Wm. Arthur Lewis as an individual. In particular, I've great respect for his late 1930s analysis of the profitability of oil companies exploiting Trinidad and how that work helped Cola Rienzi and the early OWTU.
9265 2018-08-09 05:48:18 He's effectively saying that many are worried the escalation in oil prices could rattle the world economy but the levels at which oil alters growth in his view are actually quite far off. It's not a call on the oil price

9281 2018-08-09 05:46:29 And both Switzerland and Norway pay a huge premium for access the single market. One is oil rich (and didn't find nuclear weapons with it) the other is an offshore FS haven for banking/wealth management. Leaving the EU will shrink the UK economy by 4-5%.

9293 2018-08-09 05:44:21 They have to burn it because releasing raw methane is far worse for global warming than carbon dioxide. It is waste gas from oil wells that’s not commercially worth anything, so they have no incentive to collect it rather than burning it off.
9294 2018-08-09 05:44:14 Canada has plenty of its own oil and is a net exporter, duh!
9295 2018-08-09 05:44:12 Get at least 7 hours sleep. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Eat sardines for shiny hair. I have to find something. Is it NISIM or NHB?  slows hair loss. or analogous. How to discover the true url.
9296 2018-08-09 05:43:55 good question.  if we need more east coast oil we can get it from the North Sea and eventually all from offshore Nfld/NS
9297 2018-08-09 05:43:55 What is missing is your blockchain. Org should pay for the oil with wessoncoin or something.

9303 2018-08-09 05:43:12 Its easy to be very premature in assuming beneficence when listening to the snake oil salesmen of faith.  Fooled into thinking an oppression is over.

9329 2018-08-09 05:39:08 Legit question... because I don’t understand. Why are we importing over priced Saudi oil and exporting under priced oil produced in Canada to the US? How is this a good business model or am I missing something? Who benefits?

9453 2018-08-09 05:17:40 No worries! Oh one last thing! It reduces the sebum production of your body entirely. That’s why everything dries up. So for me, I was lucky cause my oily hair stayed oil free for 3 days at a time. If your hair is naturally dry, you gotta apply oil diligently or it’ll go brittle.

9458 2018-08-09 05:16:25 Ok... I have a fix. For every illegal alien on welfare we will demand 50,000 drums of refined crude oil from the country of birth of the invader.

Also a fine to equal all paid welfare benefits, to the liberal govt officials that made their presence possible.

9460 2018-08-09 05:15:50 Well honestly the Saudis are not the wests ally. We don't have the same values  .. we just have mutual interests like Iran and oil and other business/technology ventures ... so what they did to Canada is not surprising at all
9461 2018-08-09 05:14:42 "I was... carrying a bag of it and slipped on some oil. Didn't realize I spilt any... was gonna put a bit over those-"

Unless there is a blockade of Iran's oil shipments, nothing will change.
9463 2018-08-09 05:14:22 As I said recently:

Saudi Arabia - Oil = Men shooting each other for a gallon of drinkable water.
9464 2018-08-09 05:14:14 Considering that it was all Saudis who carried out the actual 9/11 attacks, that doesn't surprise me.
I don't expect any of Canada's allies to give more than lukewarm support, as everybody depends on Saudi oil. I still hope Trudeau govt. sticks to its guns regardless of the cost.

9474 2018-08-09 05:11:31 Our go to oil is RC.  Whenever the weather changes from sunny  to rainy or cooler, we diffuse it, we apply it topically (with a carrier oil), or we simply waft it. Say bye bye  to sniffles!

So here's an idea build the pipeline and refinery create jobs become wealthy, self sufficient and tell Saudi Arabia to go F☆☆☆ themselves

9530 2018-08-09 05:03:12 @Volkswagen needs to shut down @P57VW @Palmetto57VW for bad business practices. Poorly performed oil changes turned to poorly installed replacement engine. They ruined transmission in the process and blamed the problem on me. My VW was better off if I never relied on @P57VW !
9531 2018-08-09 05:03:08 Car enthusiasts that can’t change their own oil is very sad. Lol have fun paying full synthetic for $75+ at Jiffy lube or Valvoline

9543 2018-08-09 05:02:02 No but it is clear that their was a coordinated effort against him. He is a snake oil salesman selling brain boost and alpha force. It’s a nice effor t though because the result will be increased regulations on social media which will be barriers to entry for new competitors
9544 2018-08-09 05:01:53 I have the munchies. I think it’s cause I didn’t do my mct oil today. 
9545 2018-08-09 05:01:51 I used to be all about saving our ocean animals. But that crap ruined it for all of them. Im dumping oil in that shit TOMMOROW. DONT TRY ME CRAB.
9546 2018-08-09 05:01:51 Same lol work all day in the refineries and oil field sometimes all night depends on the job the crane is on so sleep get kinda fucked up I feel ya tho!
9547 2018-08-09 05:01:49 No, I think the market sees that the world is well-supplied with oil now and for the near term. It recognizes tight supply somewhere on the horizon--maybe in a few months, maybe now. It has priced in tight supply incorrectly several times in recent months & hates to overpay.
9548 2018-08-09 05:01:37 Good for Canada Saudi Arabia is a country who respects only what they want and only when they want it, is a fifth class country with first class money and oil, and that’s the only reason everybody is so respectfull with even when they don’t deserve it

9553 2018-08-09 05:01:04 Great interview! The #MAGA people who hurl abuse at you during Trump's rallies probably watched CNN's coverage of the Challenger explosion, Berlin Wall coming down, 1st Gulf War & Iraq war. Now the snake oil salesman in our WH has duped them into believing his #FakeNews schtick.

But the US oil crises of the 70s was a much bigger tantrum against the west.
9559 2018-08-09 05:00:21 @IndianOilcl @dpradhanbjp @HP @indianoil continuous fraud in Indian oil petrol bunk Yeshwanthpur,Narayanaswamappa rd.They count as 300 rs in front of us but while giving they will only give 200. I have faced this 5 times, complained to mgr bt no use.
9560 2018-08-09 04:59:49 Of course he ain’t gonna side with his historical ally...he’s got no BALLS, and is actually afraid of the Middle East. Can’t disrupt that much precious oil supply...
9561 2018-08-09 04:59:42 Yes, cause these guys are not civil. They boast on their oil reserves and on military support and sponsorship of U.S. They think when they have America, they don't need anyone else. And America loves all dictators who are friend of U.S.

9582 2018-08-09 04:57:15 @P57VW @Palmetto57VW is the worst Volkswagen dealer ever. They performed all my oil changes and my engine went bad due to no oil. They replaced engine with a used one and damaged the transmission. @GWCWarranty won't pay because @P57VW ran up a $7k bill. Caveat emptor!

9584 2018-08-09 04:56:46 Yes. Rub castor oil on your bald patches to speed up hair regrowth (I had a receding hairline from 3 months PP to 9 months PP )
9585 2018-08-09 04:56:46 The only plan your Gov has is lies and and giving  CDN tax money to other countries. The economy isnt humming. If it wasn't for oil and gas growth last  month economy would have shrunk. Yes the oil and gas you try to stop. 2019 ur gone.

9595 2018-08-09 04:54:34 Thanks. Should’ve googled, I know. Probably would’ve mistakenly gone with extra virgin olive oil by (since that’s what in tend to use for most things, including salad dressing).

Price of oil has gone up above the figure they need to balance their budget. Besides, during the opec oil cuts, they increased outputs. 
They could care less, fam.

9609 2018-08-09 04:52:26 Has nothing to do with supporting the Saudis.  Has to do with how foolish our MoFA has been lately. We sell them jets and buy their oil, and then comment on their specific court cases in public. That’s poor work IMO.

9651 2018-08-09 04:45:16 Replacement for Stacy Dash, who works for Turning Point USA. A delusional right wing bunch of "yes-men/women" who are funded by the oil tycoons the Koch Brothers. Candace herself used to be a liberal, who realized that she wasn't making money, so she became a shill for Trump.
9652 2018-08-09 04:45:07 I guess the collapse in oil prices & a total lack of planning to get the product to market after years of expanding production didn't have any effect on those foreign oil companies huh?
9653 2018-08-09 04:45:07 I know this isn't helpful like at the immediate moment, but Barilla has microwavable pasta which like sounds weird but it's precooked and has olive oil in it and you just heat it for like 60 seconds in the microwave and it's p good.
9654 2018-08-09 04:45:05 I get it. I appreciate the explanation...although it only supports the argument that if the final destination is the same, why have separate classes. These kids give their all - they all deserve to have a spot on Lucas Oil Field.

9673 2018-08-09 04:42:59 Literally invented a new way to roll a hash oil joint that will blow ur mind no lie this is illuminati knowledge now and I'm not sharing.
9674 2018-08-09 04:42:43 None are running for reelection. Pretty sure all are in the 1%. I just know this is:
*Some deal for Trump to payback Putin or an oligarch. 
*Russia's massive&sanctioned oil reserves in the arctic.
*Putin may have kompromat on them. 
*Maybe oligarch training?
*All of the above?
9675 2018-08-09 04:42:34 Finally I washed everything after the oil show and sit back to tell you, guys, how much I love you all! Oil on pantyhose! That was a blast! 
9676 2018-08-09 04:42:22 Using brown sugar & Argan oil+African  Shea butter to exfoliate is like MAGIC 
9677 2018-08-09 04:42:18 Sometimes I mix my olaplex with my liquified coconut oil and some lemon juice and leave in my hair over night and air dry the next day, my hair has been wavy and luscious 
9678 2018-08-09 04:42:09 Bless her edges. I’m sorry love . But castor oil there at night to loosen it up
9679 2018-08-09 04:42:05 Will you also call out those Democrats who are in tho pockets of the oil and gas companies?

9687 2018-08-09 04:40:35 Vegetable oil, I would think- canola or corn oil. Olive oil would be too heavy for this recipe.

9694 2018-08-09 04:39:33 Oh, no you don't! Nuh uh. I see what you are doing there.

The Liberal government will NEVER approve open channel flow of dirty tar sands oil through Quebec.

9695 2018-08-09 04:39:21 Amaechi had a viable reason for leaving the PDP.  He left based on his issues with Patience Jonathan and GEJ all bcos he was fighting for d oil wells that were taken 4rm rivers state n given to Akwa Ibom and Bayelsa. Y did Akpabio leave the PDP?  Answer me. B objective
9696 2018-08-09 04:39:15 Starving children in America are common and have been shoplifting food for generations. So spending money on wars to protect oil resources does not put food on the table. Evidently you have always had food and no worries.
9697 2018-08-09 04:38:47 Trudeau's arrogance is on full display for the world to see now. There are proper channels for things like this but Twitter isn't one of them. Trudeau had to make a statement, which is rich considering he had no problem buying Saudi oil or selling them arms.
9698 2018-08-09 04:38:42 Yeah so what? We need the oil, that cell phone or computer you used to post is made from a great deal of oil. Get over it and quit wasting your vote on some third party bullshit.

9702 2018-08-09 04:38:04 Yes, you should put some cream or oil in your hair. Make sure to get the roots
9703 2018-08-09 04:37:59 Seems Israel role gonna be over gradually after exploitation of oil & control over maritime with blood of the soil. Israel to work for peaceful identity & play regional politics for her own people & neighbors instead being used by US business barbaric goals in the name religion.

Saudi is helping us squeeze Russian oil companies. As well as get Iranian clients like Hezbollah out if Syria. Tit for tat.

Russia feeling pain. We are rearming Ukraine. Killed Russian battalion in Syria and threaten use of their naval base there. Hurt Iran, their buds.

9708 2018-08-09 04:37:18 Not creating jobs in the oil patch. Not employing workers to finish the pipeline. So you can say what you want about jobs as it isn’t true.
9709 2018-08-09 04:37:06 This program was a laughing stock for petroleum industry professionals. Person knws nothing about oil exploration was invited to comment and wo bongian mar ra tha. When he said satellite sy oil dekha h.. Biggest bongi of the century.

9717 2018-08-09 04:36:16 You’re enjoying their cheap oil and gas prices. Trump curtsied to them and begged them for cheaper gas prices.

9719 2018-08-09 04:36:07 I'll even be more intrigued by how MV employs the PP esp if the Oil.go with what Bob had mentioned before (97 playing both units)
9720 2018-08-09 04:36:02 How about we throw in a 60000 km warranty and free oil changes and call it even
9721 2018-08-09 04:35:43 สาธุๆ 
9722 2018-08-09 04:35:38 How to treat it;
— stick to a consistent skin routine; wash face twice daily to reduce oil build up
— try acne creams, aloe Vera is really helpful instead of moisturiser
9723 2018-08-09 04:35:27 トマトピューレくらいの味でケチャップくらいのなめらかさが理想だけど、日米仏露のどのメーカーもダメだったので、もう15年くらいケチャップ買ってない。マヨネーズはお店手作りってあるけどケチャップって無いし

9736 2018-08-09 04:33:12 A vote for the #GOP is a vote for red tides, deforestation, oil spills, toxic air, poisoned water, contaminated food... #TrumpLies is despicable
9737 2018-08-09 04:33:10 Look, I’m not sure if I like what YouTubes doing, but if you think one scientist who takes loads of oil money overrides thousands of scientists you’re dead wrong.

9745 2018-08-09 04:32:21 If it is the same garlic sauce that they have at Zankou chicken, you can check at Persian markets.

It is basically garlic, salt and olive oil. Maybe a touch of lemon juice to brighten it up.

Not tzatziki though
9746 2018-08-09 04:32:17 As of right now I’m drunk and without my oil pen. A disaster in it’s finest

9758 2018-08-09 04:30:46 Saudi Arabia is grandstanding for political purposes because they are trying to send a message to the world. Stop buying their oil, keep the tuition fees, replace the students, nix the defence contracts and take a stand against this barbaric regime @JustinTrudeau

it works
9766 2018-08-09 04:30:01 And now they’re all burning the midnight oil trying to figure out how they’ll spin this on tomorrow’s news cycle.
9767 2018-08-09 04:29:59 I’m think dealing with oil and grease at work all day is why I’ve been breaking it so much lately
9768 2018-08-09 04:29:56 @JulioBorges In 1959 nobody though that Castro a banana tyrant would be a nuclear threat and should dominate Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia. Today USA, Europe, Israel… close their eyes to the great danger that is Maduro-RedKorea-Iran-narco whith the biggest oil world reserve
9769 2018-08-09 04:29:47 Does anyone have any tips for oily skin. My skin is rejecting anything I do. I look like I purposely put oil on my face. It’s disturbing.
9770 2018-08-09 04:29:42 Yeah but they have oil.
9771 2018-08-09 04:29:41 衝撃的な甘さですよね！食べる分には嬉しいけど、ケチャップには求めてない甘さですよね(*´･ω･｀)

9773 2018-08-09 04:29:15 I’m curious to find out if al-daghdadi was an Israeli deep agent. Weird how Israel has been left untouched, well for the most part. Also, who benefits from chaos in Syria? Is it about oil? Maybe Israel wanted a pipeline threw Syria so they could sell the oil stolen from Syria?
9774 2018-08-09 04:29:10  I make potato salad totally differently with oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and my secret ingredient: a generous dash of bread & butter pickle juice. It’s DELICIOUS 
9775 2018-08-09 04:28:35 Ban all plastic products except for medical uses to replace some tissues, ban faster, make obsolete the combustion engines- in the oil refineries, plastic is a by product of oil (another by-product is kerosene), Cheaper electric cars, better tax cuts @realDonaldTrump @elonmusk
9776 2018-08-09 04:28:34 I’d have to be a daft idiot to trade the legendary reliability and never-quit, who-needs-oil-anyway attitude of a 2nd gen S series for some early 2000s clunk o junk L series.

9782 2018-08-09 04:27:49 The Saudi Aramco IPO is just horeshit and hot air, offering 5% of the company for seriously inflated prices based on a rapidly diminishing oil reserve
9783 2018-08-09 04:27:40 He’s a real oil painting isn’t he?
9784 2018-08-09 04:27:20 I thought this was supposed to be a nice refreshing drink. I love coconut.. like.. meat. but I've had coconut oil shampoo before and this tasted how that smelled.
9785 2018-08-09 04:27:10 I have an idea. Let's just all go full crazy and over react immensely. Canada invades Saudi. We take all that oil and bring Human Rights. Let's just be children and escalate this to the max like a bar brawl in the Wild West days and start drawing guns on each other over feels...

9798 2018-08-09 04:24:14 what tech? we are still driving oil based cars and funding wars against ourselves?
9799 2018-08-09 04:24:13 @JustinTrudeau Ok, you and minister Freeland are making Canadians proud. Let's get a pipeline to the east, and let the Saudis drink their oil. They are barbaric religious fanatics who should be shunned until they join the modern world.

9803 2018-08-09 04:23:39 I believe you would object to any type of oil extraction techniques... Your just using the "F" word scare tactics to have the operation shut down...

Fracking and fake quakes will get you in the headlines, but they don't apply to #ANGS #UKOG.. so you can move along now...
9804 2018-08-09 04:23:35 It figures that when I finally find an oil that works for El’s hair they discontinue it. Smfh #mixedbabyproblems
9805 2018-08-09 04:23:12 I just wanna add that the oil companies who have had the biggest incentive to be against renewables admit they knew about Climate Change and deliberately misled the world.

So if you do deny climate change you're either a moron or a shill.

9810 2018-08-09 04:22:27 I am entirely in support of Christia Freeland and Government of Canada in their position in defense of human rights in backward Saudi Arabia. Dictators have become bold and rude and desert rats and oil sheiks think they are strong. Stay the course Canada.

9813 2018-08-09 04:22:16 Man y’all niggas can call lip gloss “chicken grease” cooking oil” wateva you want but I WILL NOT stop wearing it

9815 2018-08-09 04:22:10 去年の白門祭も結局隣の部屋余ってたんだから交渉しだいで場所広げられるしなあ
9816 2018-08-09 04:22:00 The world is awash with oil so why are the barrel prices all over the place? Too many traders making a fortune ! Is the $per barrel about to crash ? IMHO yes quite possibly there is no where else left to store it! The experts will say “we didn’t see it coming” as always!
9817 2018-08-09 04:21:51 Frankly I'm not going to risk it. I asked him to please tie his apron strings (as he nearly trips over them a lot & we work around hot oil & moving blades & I'm concerned he will get hurt) & he retorted me for "bullying" him & I got a write up.
9818 2018-08-09 04:21:10 เราไปพูดงั้นกะแฟนของคุณได้ไหมละ พูดได้นะผมก็มีปาก แต่ก็คิดก่อนจะพูดหรือพิม ออกมาอะคับ
9819 2018-08-09 04:21:08 Oil & Gas ke?
9820 2018-08-09 04:21:08 Semalam pakai naruko mask tea tree oil punya bangun pagi ni rasa kurang siket minyak kat muka
9821 2018-08-09 04:21:05 Really don’t like vinegar, blue cheese in small doses, olive oil sounds fine but boring.
9822 2018-08-09 04:21:03 Not sure who the we r? Oil will always b in high demand!
9823 2018-08-09 04:20:38 ちうぽけ、規模と年数はあるし新歓大会とか学祭でスマブラの方に声かけて合同開催とかにすればあっちは場所もらえて嬉しいし、こっちはどっちが上かわからせることができて実際Win-Winなわけ
9824 2018-08-09 04:20:34 I know right? They don’t have any baby oil and their hands are grimy from driving all day!
9825 2018-08-09 04:20:33 This body oil is life I Iove smelling like roses
9826 2018-08-09 04:19:45 Bryce and leadership are oil and water.  Don’t worry, Davey has a big hug waiting for him.  Even if he lollygags in the right field corner against the Braves.  Double standard for Bryce is probably numero uno why this season is about to code out...
9827 2018-08-09 04:19:44 IDC if my car’s on fire .. i only came here for an oil change, nothing else, fam.
9828 2018-08-09 04:19:43 I love your trains @MichDeplorable! So well vetted! I can only imagine the work you put into them. You are appreciated more than you know! Thanks for connecting Patriots!
9829 2018-08-09 04:19:31 Saudi Arabia GDP: 646.4 billion USD. 

Qatar GDP: 152.5 billion USD. 

Canada, with its GDP of 1.53 trillion USD, is in the top 10 oil producing countries. 

Saudi Arabia is underestimating Canada’s economic power!
9830 2018-08-09 04:19:16 I'm not an expert on Parasites cleanses, I'm more knowledgeable in Bacterial/Fungal Cleanses. I know alkaline parasite cleanses work well using black walnut, burdock root & oregano oil. 

@12D_Ascension is the parasite detox master I would ask him in regards to that.

9833 2018-08-09 04:18:41 My banner image is a quarter slice of oil on canvas. I know the mold is to steal something off the Internet, but I was vain enough to use my own here.
9834 2018-08-09 04:18:35 Best makeup remover ever: coconut oil. 

And it moisturizes too. My skin is so freaking soft.
9835 2018-08-09 04:18:21 Yemen's govt that is backed by Saudis autocracy itself? You can't fool everyone bro. Huh and tons of Saudi oil money that funds ISIS. US is struggling with Trump but we still have free media.
9836 2018-08-09 04:17:55 No offense to Snake Oil Salesman.
9837 2018-08-09 04:17:40 That’s an occupational hazard living in FL.  Has happened to a couple people I know.  An old coworker had a palmetto bug stuck in her ear.  Like with the umpire...a little oil should do the trick.
9838 2018-08-09 04:17:01 Not sure about stitches but vitamin e oil is a blessing for scars
9839 2018-08-09 04:16:44 So Becca Ever Matte Poreless Primer is gonna be my go-to for my boy brow primer. BIIITCH oil who?
9840 2018-08-09 04:16:33 Is there a reason they can't cultivate it themselves? There are several strains that are high in CBD and low in THC naturally.. CBD is CBD it doesn't have to be in the oil form to be effective.. Making cookies from home grown flowers would be more cost effective..
9841 2018-08-09 04:16:16 泳がせてから取り込めば解決
9842 2018-08-09 04:16:11 And it isn't even from real snakes.  Artificial snake oil, manufactured in China and blended in Russia.
9843 2018-08-09 04:16:04 This oil and braid sheen got my head feeling like heaven. Oh my gawd.
9844 2018-08-09 04:16:03 I would, but she doesn't like the mint oil.
9845 2018-08-09 04:15:46 Elon found a loophole and squeezed the shorts. Makes perfect sense. Saudi Arabia, a conservative country that is usually slow to change, are dramatically reshaping both the country. Why not fund Tesla. Gets away from oil dependency, has money.
9846 2018-08-09 04:15:46 When will you stop deceiving yourself? Largest economy without basic infrastructure like roads, rails, hospitals, Electric power? Largest economy based on the high price of oil. What happened when price of oil started to fall in 2014? Jonathan Govt could not pay workers salary.
9847 2018-08-09 04:15:39 What is considered salad oil?
9848 2018-08-09 04:15:28 What drives us crazy is that provincial and federal government were funding into this with the Saskatchewan House in the 1970s (the 70s!!!)—Canada was once at the forefront of the #Passivhaus movement and just dropped it, because what? Tar-sands and the oil lobby?
9849 2018-08-09 04:15:27 Well then that’s too much egg and oil
9850 2018-08-09 04:15:25 like, literally. Moving into syria to snag 70% of the oil and half the water and aid a failing french colonial infrastructure.
9851 2018-08-09 04:14:43 What’s not surprising: Colorado Oil and Gas  Association is behind this site, what is surprising (and frankly disgusting) is that they compare @energyproj to an ombudsman that organizations with integrity and values utilize
9852 2018-08-09 04:14:23 No problemo, sis! Your commentary eschews any grammatical errors...I have many of my own...lol! Just keep doing what you do. You're fantastic and real! So is the sista @MystiConnolly I hear this saying from my dad and other old school people in my life: "A squeky wheel gets oil
9853 2018-08-09 04:14:15 Oil prices rebounded on Thursday after heavy losses in the previous session that came as the China-U.S. trade dispute escalated, with official Chinese data indicating energy demand in the world's top importer has yet to recover its strength.
9854 2018-08-09 04:14:12 Deep Blue essential oil> ibuprofen
9855 2018-08-09 04:13:57 I thought I bought Koroke Pan but I bought Menchi Katsu Pan. Fucking hate Menchi Katsu. That’s this disgusting deep fried oil soaked this.

But I was hungry. I ate it.

Now I honestly don’t like the feeling in my stomach.
9856 2018-08-09 04:13:56 Problem is they only export terrorism and oil, they have nothing else. Boycotting oil will drive prices up so world govs will not do that. The US and Israel need them to fight their proxy war against Iran so they'll keep on supplying arms. Otherwise, SA is a one-trick-pony
9857 2018-08-09 04:13:43 If you want socialism, move to Venezuela, once the most wealthy nation in South America, due to huge oil reserves. If socialism could work, it would have there. When you go take plenty of toilet paper , but hurry up and go.
9858 2018-08-09 04:13:33 The Oil Age Is Over
9859 2018-08-09 04:13:30 Saudi Arabia  nigeria  Venezuela  we import oil from these human rights violating countries @SohiAmarjeet  time to stop  #canadianoil #ethical @FriendsOScience @OilsandsAction @Franktmcveety
9860 2018-08-09 04:13:20 i use first aid beauty ‘s sensitive skin cleanser then put mario badescu rose hips oil on mine. sometimes when skin is oily it’s bc there’s a lack of oil so it over compensates for it and causes excess!

9864 2018-08-09 04:12:51 An oil cleanser, an essence, something with retinol, some face masks for hydration/brightening, and a lip mask 
9865 2018-08-09 04:12:49 Black Caster oil and flaxseed ECO Syle gel really is magic  I should’ve bought two
9866 2018-08-09 04:12:07 i work up  stories to make you purchase heating oil
9867 2018-08-09 04:11:55 @mambodejuliana hola no me conoce pero soy un muslumana por mucho tiempo. Bebe 2 teaspoon por la mañana y dos en la noche de pure coconut oil y pídele a Dios que te cure y vera. Te cuida
9868 2018-08-09 04:11:49 Our stainless steel #nameplates are durable enough to withstand the harsh environments of the #oil and gas industry.
9869 2018-08-09 04:11:23 Yes it was good. I sautéed some garlic and that Spanish olive oil
9870 2018-08-09 04:11:17 At night Aveeno clear complexion foaming cleanser (only 6$), any neutrogena sheet mask (2.50$) or bentonite clay mask about twice a week and neutrogena hydro boost water gel. In the AM just splash my face w/ water n use neutrogena oil free moisturizer with spf
9871 2018-08-09 04:11:16 Have you thought about using just CBD oil? I’ve been really wanting to get some for mine
9872 2018-08-09 04:11:07 Tea tree oil and natural aloe Vera
9873 2018-08-09 04:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: no crust with sweet coconut oil and pineapple.
9874 2018-08-09 04:11:02 I get the cheapest kind that doesn't have vegetable oil (if <2%, I consider looking the other way).
9875 2018-08-09 04:10:44 "Imagine if Standard Oil, with its monopolistic production, had access to futures and produced almost all the drilling equipment for their competitors. That’s Bitmain."

That's a completely horrifying analogy.  Thanks Trav.

9877 2018-08-09 04:10:31 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
9878 2018-08-09 04:10:29 It's the exact same logic. You make a situation worse to generate funds for treatment. It makes no sense. The oil industry uses the same playbook as the tobacco industry.
9879 2018-08-09 04:10:22 Can’t wait to have my own business when I get out  the oil field
9880 2018-08-09 04:10:21 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
9881 2018-08-09 04:10:14 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
9882 2018-08-09 04:10:02 ...but I really like Extra Virgin Olive Oil on my salads.
9883 2018-08-09 04:09:31 I’d go back to finish college pursuing a degree in marine biology/oceanography and try to find a way to clean up our extremely polluted oceans from oil spills, corporate plastic wastes, etc. When I was in college my gpa was 3.9 but had to work 2 or 3 jobs just to get by...

9886 2018-08-09 04:09:10 Please do both  too much oil! 
I googled it and it said we were both gonna die 
9887 2018-08-09 04:09:10 I would gladly welcome that 5000 usd oil money...2020 why u taking so long 
9888 2018-08-09 04:09:01 That manifesto will be implemented but will take time;do appreciate problems BJP faced when they came to power: No money in till,Army had no arms ammunition,OROP, oil debts to Iran,exodus from Yemen, hostile world,hostile media

9891 2018-08-09 04:08:10 Bread is EVERYTHING. A crusty sourdough, pane or baguette - even better grill them w/olive oil and garlic.
9892 2018-08-09 04:07:51 NOTHING—Should have to be Subsidized—In a Free & Fair Competitive Environment! With Cheap Oil & Gas—Consumers Win!
9893 2018-08-09 04:07:49 my face is suuuuper sensitive to just about everything, so the garnier dries it out, but following up with the clean and clear adds moisture back to it without the oil! hope it helps!
9894 2018-08-09 04:07:49 I thought they fried the stew with the oil ,
But at a bukka recently , I watched the woman stop selling stew as it was getting smaller and turned a big pot of hot oil into the stew , 
I lost my appetite immediately.
9895 2018-08-09 04:07:33 Will Send Oil
9896 2018-08-09 04:07:32 BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE TECHNICALITY OF IT ALL, IT IS

MAYO IS JUST EGGS AND OIL

IM NOT SAYING I DO IT IM JUST BEING HYPOTHETICAL
9897 2018-08-09 04:06:44 生態系を壊すってなんかよさみがある
9898 2018-08-09 04:06:39 Brainwashing using righteous anger isn’t new. Been done before by grifters & it’s being done now. Not understanding democracy is as dangerous as believing a snake oil salesman & his band of con artists! 

Taking social help & then maligning those who want to give it. Deplorable.
9899 2018-08-09 04:06:38 brother we need independence and independent rulers Egypt is an oil producing country but its economy is worst than us due to military lead dictators it is rich in cotton/edible farm outputs peoples are far poorer than us
9900 2018-08-09 04:06:02 eh tapi kan gwa juga mau yg oil ya wkwk
9901 2018-08-09 04:06:01 Yall really buying “come to me oil” from your southern houdou neighbor ms gloria in apartment 4 to bag poor sugar daddies? 

*laughs in natural scorpionic energies*
9902 2018-08-09 04:05:58 I like doing oil changes
9903 2018-08-09 04:05:52 貫通は…ありよりのあり。です
そういうこともできるかぁ
9904 2018-08-09 04:05:37 I am interested too. The current diplomatic spat could help give eastern Canada the incentive to stop importing so much oil. Much helping to support human rights abuses.
9905 2018-08-09 04:05:19 You guys realize it’s essentially the same thing as putting oil and eggs into a cake, right???
9906 2018-08-09 04:05:13 Has to be better than VA where it’s not even legal medically. We JUST got affirmative defense for oil use approved but there’s no licensed dispensaries at all and probably won’t be until next year 
9907 2018-08-09 04:05:10 It's amazing how much you can stuff in a #JannieSack too. I managed 2 x 2l bottles of pop, 2 x 1l bottles of pop, 3 x biscuits, 2 x items of clothing, 1 x big pack of coloured pencils, 1 x big pack of oil pastels, 1 x tub of hummus, 1 x purse, 1 x camera ... at least.
9908 2018-08-09 04:05:07 When @Tesla  wants to go private using probable Saudi oil money  , one wonders if an electric expansion will be speeded up or slowed down by those with conflict of interests.
9909 2018-08-09 04:04:39 This should be a great time for Canada to start amping up it's economy. No more dirty oil imports, our gov't should be celebrating this & working on getting Canadian ethical oil to each coast.
9910 2018-08-09 04:04:33 I can't seem to find pure CBD oil in NYS.  Yay that it's working for you!!!!!
9911 2018-08-09 04:04:17 do they care about the price of oil? no.

they are busy selling wagons to the wanna-be digital 49ers.
9912 2018-08-09 04:04:13 I originally commited myself to Legal action against the Nurse, and the Hospital who attacked me, because I didn't want it to happen to anyone else. I really could give one flying crap about money. I've given up Houses, Shasta Property, Oil wells in Tennesee... To people in need.
9913 2018-08-09 04:04:05 Next time you're at harbor freight, get one of the extra turbo bigass oil filter wrench/vice grip.

Those things are scary effective.
9914 2018-08-09 04:04:01 By the way this grapefruit essential oil that is oozing out of my diffuser has my place smelling mighty divine! 
9915 2018-08-09 04:03:29 This makes the oil more valueable benefiting both the Suadis and the Russians?
9916 2018-08-09 04:03:25 Didn’t have a socket at the time and I had forgotten I was missing my original oil clamp from moving, I used the screw driver method first since I was tooless and the auto shops had closed. Then neighbors lent me their filter loop and it broke, so this was the last resort xD
9917 2018-08-09 04:03:13 This headline is Fake news. Canada is an oil exporter but buys back refined distillates from the USA
9918 2018-08-09 04:03:06 How's that oil tasting? You will be getting some asbestos to suck down with that soon. Your 3rd party votes kill all life on . #GreenDeathParty

9921 2018-08-09 04:02:53 what scent/oil would you recommend?
9922 2018-08-09 04:02:30 I make my own body oil with coconut oil, shea butter and sweet almond oil and it’s literally the perfect combo but that might just be me
9923 2018-08-09 04:02:05 I will not bro rubbing oil on just to sweat it off in like 30 secs

9954 2018-08-09 03:59:04 Is there anything coconut oil can’t do?
9955 2018-08-09 03:59:02 i love when my fav idolish boys color is gray because it means any sweets/drink themed merch for him is going to be some ominous gray shit that looks like it was laced with car oil
9956 2018-08-09 03:58:51 Indeed.  I mean, it's baby OIL after all...

9958 2018-08-09 03:58:28 Put coconut oil on your eye lids before bed or breast milk if you can 
9959 2018-08-09 03:58:14 My grandma racked up on hemp oil lotion and stuff today

9963 2018-08-09 03:57:20 Pro tip: don’t pay to go to an actual spa when you can get Lush workers to massage you with every lotion/oil/body butter in the store
9964 2018-08-09 03:56:51 and the govt wants us to save oil

9966 2018-08-09 03:56:10 Imagine if Standard Oil, with its monopolistic production, had access to futures and produced almost all the drilling equipment for their competitors. That’s Bitmain.

9968 2018-08-09 03:55:58 I got a surprise for you baby
Ice cream, baby oil and strawberries
9969 2018-08-09 03:55:57 A big raise in oil prices thanks to the stupid move of re-sanctioning Iran will wipe out many of these gains.
9970 2018-08-09 03:55:53 Makes me livid! And I know the Gulf Oil spill years back had to have impacted this crisis. Had an inexpensive safeguard- a safety valve on the rigs not been deregulated by the Bush administration that spill would of never happened. Infuriating!
9971 2018-08-09 03:55:53 And to even think that is happens in the mid of the week, a WEDNESDAY at that, says a lot about the joblessness in that region. Well, if you ve lived in that region, you ll know that they've worse problem than the Northern youths do.
9972 2018-08-09 03:55:52 How is "CAGW is driven by money and politics of the government-industrial complex."—even if it were correct—not a conspiracy theory? For it to be true,wudnt the vast majority of scientists have to be conspiring to hide the truth for $ they cud get more of from oil co think tanks?
9973 2018-08-09 03:55:49 Coconut oil as body oil is fine though
9974 2018-08-09 03:55:48 You justify failure of RIVERS STATE( a super rich oil state) to pay its pensioners for year by comparing it with another in the like Osun. what a generation.
9975 2018-08-09 03:55:40 Is this the US invading canada for oil?
9976 2018-08-09 03:55:35 Psalm 23:5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over.
9977 2018-08-09 03:55:32 Hey Saudi Arabia, we have all the oil and money we will ever need, so fuck you creeps.
9978 2018-08-09 03:55:19 Pancetta is my shiiiit. Kept it simple this time with salt, pepper, and a lot of olive oil. I think I might have burnt them, they were a little bitter ... Anyway next time I'll dress em up with some salt meaty smoky goodness next time

9980 2018-08-09 03:55:05 If you really want to get your stainless steel super clean -- maybe once a month -- you can use a few drops of olive oil! Check out this video to see how it works.
9981 2018-08-09 03:54:58 @POTUS and @PressSec claim Trump is so tough on Russia. Russia has taken a big hit thanks to the decrease in price of oil. By placing sanctions on Iran again, it’ll raise the price of oil. Asbestos will now be allowed to be used, Russia is a major exporter of that as well.
9982 2018-08-09 03:54:58 Fair. Also must have two fight scenes half naked rolling in oil.
9983 2018-08-09 03:54:55 In the too near future, wars will be fought over water, not oil.  Terrifying.

Oil and water do mix, for twice the impact- just shake.

9985 2018-08-09 03:54:36 Step two of @energyproj weird propaganda program: Tomorrow, they’ll spend all day trying to work the refs. The problem is, the #copolitics press corps universally recognizes this cynical and disrespectful strategy for what it is. Big oil crossed the line here big time.
9986 2018-08-09 03:54:34 It’s 2018 and y’all still using coconut oil on your skin? Like y’all really didn’t learn anything in 2016?!?
9987 2018-08-09 03:54:32 @BarackObama separate Punjab province of India as a country or an autonomous region after that bring an oil pipeline from Western Siberia to Punjab of India via Pakistan under your body colored African people's investment.

9990 2018-08-09 03:54:18 Does anyone else moisturize their hole with coconut oil?
9991 2018-08-09 03:54:13 A country w resources is the richest country. We have oil, gas, food, clean water, vast forests, *shrugs*--we're fine.
9992 2018-08-09 03:54:07 You're pretty ignorant of the Canadian economy aren't you? We have the second largest oil reserves in the world and you only supply 9% of it. Canada produces more oil then it consumes. Canada can supply it's own oil needs.
9993 2018-08-09 03:53:54 Hello sis. Sorry kacau again  nak tanya, currently cleansing routine I pakai micellar water and cleanser je. I patut stick to it or guna oil based cleanser for double cleansing method? Sebab I tak pakai makeup so kalau nak pakai cleansing oil macam rugi je 
9994 2018-08-09 03:53:53 99 Cent Stores: The only store where motor oil and expired lettuce are conveniently on the same aisle. #RealisticCommercialSlogans
9995 2018-08-09 03:53:46 All the fantastic money making opportunities, you know, jailing refugees, taking kids away from their parents, befriending Russian oligarchs, reimposing sanctions on Iran cause the Saudis want more $$ for oil...I could go on, but you get my drift. Grifters gonna grift.
9996 2018-08-09 03:53:43 ExxonMobil is hoping on of the biggest oil field in Sindh coast.
They already made down-payment for the drilling. And requested sector in Port Qasim.
ExxonMobil thinks it's to early to say this could be biggest oil reserves but also can't deny.
9997 2018-08-09 03:53:41 Cool , wish id could attend but to far 2 attend, be very brill looking at exhibition as you have alot wonderful pictures and now  oil sketches

10001 2018-08-09 03:53:09 Yes to tomatoes detoxifying charcoal cleanser helped mine sooooo much and then once I got done using it I’d use just a little bit of cetaphil face lotion and it’s helped my face stop producing so much oil!

10003 2018-08-09 03:52:51 WorleyParsons has had five fairly substantial contract wins over the last seven days...a solar project, wind project and a oil project in the North Sea.
10004 2018-08-09 03:52:43 I hope my hair feels bomb in the AM. I added avocado, vitamin E oil, egg whites, & an essential oil that has rosemary, lemon, peppermint, and orange.
10005 2018-08-09 03:52:40 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
