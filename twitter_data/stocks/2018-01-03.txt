41 2018-01-03 23:46:48 I've made $9,000 from stocks in the past 3 months  if all goes well, I can pay off the rest of my car and maybe spend 2019 abroad.
42 2018-01-03 23:46:30 You might be thinking of the smaller 8" one cause I don't think Best Buy stocks the larger plushes, but that one is still pretty nice and probably worth buying.
43 2018-01-03 23:45:45 Yup, the outcome looks bleak for US stocks.  Fortunately, foreign stocks are much cheaper.
44 2018-01-03 23:45:08 Excited to announce that on Tuesday, January 9th, I'll be launching my FREE eCourse!  The course is for beginner investors and is entitled,, "120 Minutes to Your First Stock Market Investment".  #stocks #StockMarket #investing #money #personalfinance
45 2018-01-03 23:43:25 Yes, look at today's volume
46 2018-01-03 23:42:42 There is some speculation about the CEO selling stocks in the past November/December though.
47 2018-01-03 23:42:11 Glad to see this comment.  Everything from $TSLA has been someone else problem and not $tsla but @elonmusk thinks he can make promises that are not met.  I left penny stocks 4 years ago because @SEC_Enforcement shut them down.  The fundamentals do not support this price
48 2018-01-03 23:41:38 How about #Trump supporter @HomeDepot giving all the money to board? Buying back stocks? As well as many other right leaning super corps? 
Be clear... SWAir is a PROGRESSIVE, LEFT LEANING corp. 
Lying bitch.
49 2018-01-03 23:41:24 U.S. stocks start 2018 strong, global economic sentiment is indicated by ISM Manufacturing Index moving to heights last seen in 2004. 4th Q earnings now on deck and should be good.
50 2018-01-03 23:41:19 what do you think now.. more upside???
51 2018-01-03 23:40:52 If he's got the money he can buy what he wants - that didn't bother me. Right now I like financials too- the banks, big and regionals, $PYPL & $SQ. Also oil/gas stocks. I also got back into retail a couple months ago - it had a good run. ER season will tell.
52 2018-01-03 23:40:35 Yea, they work on crappy stocks but not stocks like NVDA, AAPL, BABA etc
53 2018-01-03 23:40:22 On top of that, the Trump tax cuts will be a windfall for anyone with stocks in razor wire & concrete wall manufacturers, bulletproof armour installers, & bodyguard/merc personnel hire.
54 2018-01-03 23:40:13 stocks fall nearly 50% and you think its wise to tweet something like this?
55 2018-01-03 23:39:59 Summary: 1.Public is very long stocks,aggressively bullish. 
2. Monetary policy is tightening, this will accelerate. 
3. Stocks are extremely expensive on many metrics. 
4. Oil / inflation is rising and will accelerate. 
5. Sentiment/ fear is very complacent.
= decide your risk?
56 2018-01-03 23:39:35 Buy/Sell is great for normal stocks that only gain 10-20% a year.  Cryptos are a different beast, the growth rate will leave you behind.
57 2018-01-03 23:39:14 Yeah business deregulation seems underrated. Getting rid of mundane regulations and lowering taxes makes it more affordable to expand operations, hire more people, etc. also makes corporate stocks more valuable. Everyone can benefit it willing to
58 2018-01-03 23:38:56 Agree, especially when you consider that almost the same thing happened last week. To put it another way.. @investlikemike said "big time investors took the weed stocks for a ride"
59 2018-01-03 23:38:34 When sector #investing its very common to use the expression . A rising tide lifts all boats.  #semiconductor #stocks are back in vogue. Unless there is a special story most will move up. Same with #Oil & #Banks etc. Identify the sector swings early & you can make big #money
60 2018-01-03 23:38:24 I see bear flags work all the time despite the market going higher but as I think about it, most of those stocks are down trending.  Like TWLO or GNC. Two that come to mind.
61 2018-01-03 23:38:07 Get into stocks people. Thats where the real money is at!
62 2018-01-03 23:37:31 Holy shit! between Weed Stocks and Cryptocurrency I'm sure a bunch of people made a lot of money today. Pretty impressive gains all around.
63 2018-01-03 23:37:13 gym buddy of mine who dabbles in stocks hit me to let me know he is feeling the blows of the new tax legislation by trump. his fed taxes went up this past pay period by $17 #ouch
64 2018-01-03 23:36:15 Personally I feel they should have to liquidate all stocks and buy 5 yr treasury bonds. They can cash them in at the end of their term when the bond mature, or roll them over should they be re-elected. 
Then they'll really have a vested interest in America as a whole.
65 2018-01-03 23:35:18 Cool. Starts with Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC. Big media stocks continue to have impressive gains. I am sure your stock portfolio is also making tremendous gains. Loser. MAGA!! Vote Libertarian!!
66 2018-01-03 23:34:59 Our markets are in sector rotation again. #technology #Semiconductors #Software & other big #Tech back in vogue . Tax savings will save companies billions . #Oil, #Engery & #metals & #mining have been & look to continue .  MU>EXXI>XLE>FCX>CLF Some good upside potential #stocks
67 2018-01-03 23:34:59 Yes its worrying - that's the right way to feel. However, I don't think the company is going anywhere anytime soon - the products are good - best name recognition in fields. Own some more reliable stocks to offset the risk!

70 2018-01-03 23:34:04 Didn’t know that was a thing. Always thought pussy was like stocks. You make your investment but eat your losses if you don’t earn the gains you anticipated.
71 2018-01-03 23:34:00 Right? It's ALMOST like saying you're a dumbass for hanging on to those Amazon stocks for so long. Almost. Give it a couple months and it'll probably be on par

85 2018-01-03 23:21:18 Stocks are not the most trustworthy indicators of an economy.. what goes up will eventually come back down. Most of what's happened to date seem to be the result of optimistic speculation The tax cuts; well -none of us will know the TRUE cost of that for a few more yrs

215 2018-01-03 22:15:41 All three major indexes set new records today. It does appear that stocks will never go down again - until they do. Among others, chips and energy led the way. Breadth good, not record: 1.5 and 1.6 to 1.

230 2018-01-03 22:07:54 That's good right. Cryptos giving the masses access to wealth better than stocks.

241 2018-01-03 21:58:45 People like you are why I thought Kleenex would be a safe bet last year for stocks. I was wrong, most of you folks use your sleeves.

258 2018-01-03 21:49:37 I’ve got my feet dipped in both. Just like stocks, you just have to educate yourself about crypto to feel more comfortable trading. Buy cryptocurrencies you believe in and stay on top of its development/news.

Should you buy Intel stocks?

Con: they might get sued and forced to pay for replacement chips.

302 2018-01-03 21:31:41 BB will be one of the best tech stocks of 2018, all the big ones have run, time for the smaller ones to outperform. I will also throw TWTR into that category, but with a bit less confidence.

313 2018-01-03 21:26:12 Because they're easier to push around w smaller market caps, and people are dumb.  Most of these alts are like penny stocks on steroids.  But hey, nothing against making money, just don't be left holding the bag.  Anything under $5 in the top 10 works... until it doesn't.

Consensus leans toward even or slight Bayo favor
317 2018-01-03 21:25:06 Now watch the stocks drop because big business will give so much to themselves each company will report losses.  Remember the billions of dollars of bailouts that went to bonus checks and none of them went to jail.  Only poor people go to jail for robbery.  Big business wins.

330 2018-01-03 21:21:23 Think in terms of liquidity. Stocks trade 100% in fiat. Imagine if shares of Valeant Pharmaceutical traded agaisnt private shares of Theranos, but you couldn't trade for USD and didn't represent ownership in either company. Try giving the corner deli a share in Theranos for a sub

340 2018-01-03 21:18:06 Huh? You are BSC. You present stats that you cannot even read and understand. You are deluded into thinking that stocks are a product of the Presidency alone.
341 2018-01-03 21:16:59 If your Bill Gates and invented the product you should make allot of money, most CEO's did not invent anything but are glorified managers. Their compensation should be based on a nominal salary and stocks. If they drive the price up they win as do the shareholders.
342 2018-01-03 21:16:30 2/2 l'importance de l'énergie et des stocks pétroliers pour un pays. C'est resté vulnérable et à leur merci.

344 2018-01-03 21:16:16 Just like when you buy stocks, you need to stay in the market for the long term. In looking at the long term, the tax plan is bad for the economy. I guarantee that taxes will need to be raised because of budget shortfalls.
345 2018-01-03 21:15:49 Haven’t traded stocks yet in 2018.  Still mostly long the index.  Also still have $EWW trade on.

348 2018-01-03 21:14:41 If we are talking specifically about crypto, I think most people (journalists included) don't understand how it works/what it's purpose is outside of the recent trend of people treating them like stocks. More broadly speaking though I'd have to disagree...

356 2018-01-03 21:11:16 Some will remember when the last $POT.CA stock, #Potash Corp. was the largest capital name on the Canadian exchange. Then it lost 67% of its market cap in one year. Sic transit gloria. So when it comes to the next pot stocks, caveat emptor.

367 2018-01-03 21:06:22 What's missing from this is that cuts in taxes on the 0.01% will mean more money chasing the same stocks. That drives the price of stocks up, which  puts pressure on CEOs to keep the "value" of their stocks up by making their companies more profitable - lower wages result.
368 2018-01-03 21:05:55 I am starting to look at the aftermath, picking up the pieces of overbought and sold stocks

404 2018-01-03 20:54:25 If you’re invested in stocks this is the time to enjoy it, won’t always be as enjoyable as ‘17 & start to ‘18... Remember 2014-2016 consolidation and how frustrating it was watching accounts go  then  then    
405 2018-01-03 20:54:05 The TFSA accounts are for Canadians so I would contact an advisor at your bank to see how and if you can buy stocks. The important part is to trade out of a tax free account so that you don’t get taxed on your gains.

412 2018-01-03 20:52:43 I wonder why stocks went up? Hmm.. Millionaire companies get a HUGE boost. This Tax took long enough to pass. It's not surprising companies want Trump Inc & GOP around so they can continue to rape our planet. Bonuses will stop soon. They think we're stupid,bad choice!

428 2018-01-03 20:46:57 US stocks extend the gains into the close.  Nasdaq up another 0.84% on the day
The US stocks are trading to new session highs as the session moves toward the close.
The Nasdaq is now up 0.84% up 59 points. The S&P is up 17.5 points or 0.64%. The Dow is up 110 point or 0.44%.
429 2018-01-03 20:46:51 You see it everyday with penny stocks ,  easy to manipulate and pump but end of day they are just scams.  You seeing that now with some of these crypto pumps.  Coins with very little usage or merits pumped no different, eventually fundamentals catch up and the real leaders lead.

548 2018-01-03 19:45:17 am I addicted to speculating on penny stocks? 

yes.

is that a problem? 

the answer to that question is also yes.

552 2018-01-03 19:43:52 Learning how to trade penny stocks 
553 2018-01-03 19:43:12 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS
554 2018-01-03 19:42:58 Do you mean Stocks or crypto? Crypto yes, not sure stocks
555 2018-01-03 19:42:54 et les stocks hatm ??
556 2018-01-03 19:42:36 I want to see true technology leaders with revolutionary products and strong moves. But the market likes more conservative #stocks currently.
557 2018-01-03 19:42:06 Thinking about investing in cryptocurrency and stocks at the same time.
558 2018-01-03 19:41:59 They are the biggest holders of stocks and shares in the EU, their portfolio is huge, they influence the stock market, but you knew this, just forgot to mention it ..... Here's another two questions 1) Is Norway a rich country 2) Is it because of oil ?
559 2018-01-03 19:41:47 Bad time to buy, correction due soon. After correction, probably Stratis or Funfair (if you're looking for penny stocks).
560 2018-01-03 19:41:15 I wonder if Mueller is looking into who in the Trump camp bought & sold coffee stocks cuz there was an awful lot of boys runnin' lattes thru that group.
561 2018-01-03 19:40:44 Any chance we can get a sense of how many corporations are simply buying back stocks instead of hiring or expanding? These numbers mean nothing without context.
562 2018-01-03 19:39:50 Any #stocks #investors have advice on what to do about @Tesla prior to tomorrow nights report? Bought in mid June, I'm currently at a loss ;(
563 2018-01-03 19:39:09 But the rate of interest is not the price of "capital" (or of "money").
And it would be better if the BoC chose some other instrument. Like the price of apples, or a stock index. But in either case it is pegging the price of money to apples or stocks.

567 2018-01-03 19:36:46 Ehh, I’m honestly not too sure. I was doing some research, and they said the legalization in Cali will boost up stocks in Canada
568 2018-01-03 19:36:31 #WDHR - ~ Rapidly growing broad-market sales 
Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.
569 2018-01-03 19:36:27 Tough on N. Korea, more money in my pocket, stocks are growing, illegals being deported, refugees being vetted better, free enterprise on the internet and no government mandate for socialized medicine...to name just a few.
570 2018-01-03 19:36:18 Thank God!
571 2018-01-03 19:36:17 stocks are broke altcoins are woke
572 2018-01-03 19:36:14 $WDHR !! A massive new sales channel on the horizon 
A third reason marijuana stocks were on fire in 2017 is the expectation that our neighbors to the north, Canada, will legalize adult-use pot by July 2018.

574 2018-01-03 19:34:49 I forgot the shareholder name but its a big chinese company that held like a little over half the stocks and they removed fantagios CEO and put in their own CEO
575 2018-01-03 19:34:39 Good move. I’ve always wanted to be aggressive with stocks and what not so I’m going to let it sit for a few months to see my progress. If it doesn’t go as planned I’ll switch to the middle
576 2018-01-03 19:34:16 Worldwide there is but I agree that finding the cheapest AM stocks is easier.
577 2018-01-03 19:34:11 @RobinhoodApp is so sick. At one point a few months ago I had invested well over a grand in mostly defense stocks and cashed out with +16% profit overall (after only 4 months!) It can be risky though. You have to constantly comb the news to get an edge on the market trends.
578 2018-01-03 19:33:42 I agree with this in that, yes, stocks will continue ever higher.  Disagree with the reasoning, however. Markets have nothing to do with value any more.  Its become an entitlement to keep the masses happy.
579 2018-01-03 19:32:23 Cannabis stocks are still on fire in Canada. Go Canopy Growth Corp!

668 2018-01-03 18:51:35 The question is why are EM stocks better inflation hedges in their countries than US stocks. The reason is probably because EM companies are much more into physical capital (a of which is imported) and tends to go up in value with inflation.

687 2018-01-03 18:39:33 It is no coincidence stocks values exploded as soon as Trump was inaugurated. Contrary to what fake news outlets tell you, people and companies largely have a lot of confidence in him. You’d be wise to take polls with a big grain of salt after election.

689 2018-01-03 18:37:57 Back in 2014 marijuana stocks dropped close to 45% in January and bounced back up to a 400% Or more $trtc $hemp $cbis $grnh.. waiting for that 50% drop
690 2018-01-03 18:37:51 So you are telling me that millionaires off Microsoft, Amazon and Apple stocks didn't care about money? They invested because they firmly believed in their "technology"???  There are always two sides.  Let them make money LOL
691 2018-01-03 18:37:10 I guess they can buy weed stocks then :)
692 2018-01-03 18:37:09 People forget that in downcycle these stocks had corrected a lot too. So, bound to rise higher than others in up cycle. Reversal to mean.
693 2018-01-03 18:37:06 I told you! CRVP was a stock to watch. Take the risk while you still have time!

694 2018-01-03 18:36:51 I really wonder why the CEO sold a lot of his stocks...
695 2018-01-03 18:36:26 I wanna invest in stocks, move across the states and duck off. That’s a very real goal for me
696 2018-01-03 18:36:26 Investing in some stocks. Need some help. #investing
697 2018-01-03 18:35:47 And for months he was merely feet away from the Oval Office. Yeah, that's  reassuring. Trump stocks the White House with lunatics. Himself included.
698 2018-01-03 18:35:00 MJ stocks doing well, second day streak! Yas!!!!
699 2018-01-03 18:34:27 Just like other coins it’ll go on a run and shake out. I’m planning to hold for years so when it drops I’m not bothered. XRP is quite possibly one of the most exciting investment in all my years investing into startups, stocks, crypto.
700 2018-01-03 18:34:01 If you don’t make me feel like I feel when my stocks or cryptos are going up I don’t want you baby
701 2018-01-03 18:33:57 I'm on vacation... which also means I'm not checking my crypto or stocks until I get back... first time in almost 2 years I don't compulsively check it... feels really good.
702 2018-01-03 18:33:36 I have my money in the stock market and I am middle class I’m doing great right now. Are you suggesting that now that the stocks are high that us middle-class now can become wealthy I see that toI. MAGA!
703 2018-01-03 18:33:16 @RogerandJP I could be mistaken but it's my understanding that Publix only sells stocks to its employees. I believe that's why their customer service is so good - it literally pays for employees to be courteous.

Stop the stock market bullshit and focus on your god damn jobs of actually producing cannabis as opposed to selling stocks like there's no tommorow.

729 2018-01-03 18:19:22 You are just picking Penny stocks... its easy to say at the end of the year which ones actually worked...
730 2018-01-03 18:19:02 They should have bought stocks!
731 2018-01-03 18:19:00 I’ve heard all this about it but I still don’t know, is it something with stocks?
732 2018-01-03 18:18:47 I am suspicious of stocks that have trouble bouncing during momentum rallies.
733 2018-01-03 18:18:26 Nominally, perhaps, but not in real terms. The goal is to preserve purchasing power. e.g. Venezuelan stocks are way up in Bolivars, but not enough to keep up w/debasement b/c the real economy is in shambles & so are the companies in it.
734 2018-01-03 18:18:19 Hey Rekt Stocks thanks for the follow!
735 2018-01-03 18:17:46 I'm in Philly, so I should be in the 2-4/freezing rain range. Hopefully I have enough food stocks

752 2018-01-03 18:11:49 If yields spike and stocks spike with it, that signals the end. Stocks will implode and then yields will drop back down imo. I still think we go below 1% on the 10 year

755 2018-01-03 18:11:06 I bet there's a story in why that particular one went 'off' that's more complicated than simply the can being damaged. But I don't even know the variety of film stocks used to make these prints.
756 2018-01-03 18:10:58 With most pot stocks running $LG is becoming one of the most undervalued mj companies. We are talking a future multi-billion $ market cap
757 2018-01-03 18:10:49 We're not able to say if we're getting more stock however it's a good idea to pop the item in your saved items and keep a close eye on it - it's also worth checking our back in stock and new in page as our stocks change all the time.
758 2018-01-03 18:10:32 my favourite thing is that it happened two weeks ago, and they sold the exact number of stocks they were able to sell. intel CEOs are mandated to have at least 250k stocks to keep their position, and they sold a number that brought them to /exactly/ 250,000 stocks
759 2018-01-03 18:10:26 If you don't want to loose, and want to ride the wave a little, put a H or two on XLM and XRP, they're like pennies stocks (sub $2.50/full coin) . Fire and forget, basically sit on it for the next while, 2018 is their years to mature, better yet, buy 100/200 of each for more
760 2018-01-03 18:09:35 The point is that stocks are owned mainly by the rich and less than half of Americans own stock.  Also the stock markets in Japan and Hong Kong did way better than the US stock market.
761 2018-01-03 18:09:22 I invested in Germany, Switzerland and Norway since they are strong economies. Daimler of Germany says Trumps tax cut will save them 2bn Euros next year. Their stocks exploded -
762 2018-01-03 18:09:21 didn't intel's ceo sell a bunch of his stocks? not sure on the timetable but maybe it was that

767 2018-01-03 18:05:04 Who will buy back stocks and pay down debts with no regard for creating jobs. There has to be a demand for goods and services for the job market to expand. People will still look for the best deal.
768 2018-01-03 18:04:35 Nah. I'm just inattentive.

772 2018-01-03 18:04:09 @marketcall Hi @AndrewBellBNN my question to David Fingold is about Agnico Eagle (AEM) about their performance and whether or not it’s worth adding to a portfolio even with gold stocks typically having a negative beta.

778 2018-01-03 18:01:45 There is no basis for the steel stocks priced at these levels - show me one o/s of momentum either on infra play or the next momentum trade. No one guided to these levels and earn in 2017 do not support this. This is nutty.

824 2018-01-03 17:45:28 The weekly bar charts are impressive for the following stocks: Santander Consumer (SC - 18.63); Rayonier  Inc. (RYN - 31.90); Marcus & Millichap (MMI - 32.02) and Euronav (EURN - 9.43).
825 2018-01-03 17:44:33 .Better: stocks up because people have money with no other place to put it, when seeking a return that surpasses inflation.

828 2018-01-03 17:42:51 was just talking in general. Not about these stocks.
829 2018-01-03 17:42:31 Zee Media is available at 7x FY19 EBIDTA. One of the cheapest media stocks & that too from a bellwether media house. TV/Online shopping could add to valuations. Make no mistake, Porinju has done his homework on this one & is all set for multibagger returns.
830 2018-01-03 17:42:15 IMO, this is mostly about building an appropriate portfolio for someone rather than the optimal portfolio. Some bonds and stocks are inappropriate for certain investors.
831 2018-01-03 17:42:06 Most middle class and def the poor do not own stocks.
832 2018-01-03 17:42:01 If you truly believe that, then turn in your 401K and sell your stocks...Oh, that's right...why would you do that when your making so much money on them...

835 2018-01-03 17:39:52 The obvious lesson is that valuation matters. First level thinking? I can take that insult. Nobody's afraid to say that Japanese real estate prices became insane. So why are we afraid to say Japanese stocks got too expensive?

844 2018-01-03 17:37:34 The mobile market is huge (Super Data Research estimates it as a 40 billion dollar market) so it's no wonder expectations were high for Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. Big Expectations lead to big disappointment which leads to falling stocks.
845 2018-01-03 17:37:17 I agree Jessika. We are going to look back at these crypto stocks day as the golden age of trading. I love this scan and set ups it alerts me to.

848 2018-01-03 17:36:17 Should defo bring back public floggings and stocks for these scum bags.

855 2018-01-03 17:34:40 Important to understand that these China Internet stocks are bumping up with the US Tech Sector but are not beneficiaries of US Corp Tax.  Would not be surprised to see pullbacks in $BABA, $YY, $NTES, $CTRP - trading shorts.

864 2018-01-03 17:31:43 True, too bad my broker for stocks charges a minimum fee per trade. 100 vs 10 will surely eat some of my profits. At least for my broker. Could be there are some better brokers out there

870 2018-01-03 17:30:03 Yesterday's semi-quiet session has given way to a brisk rally that could be driven by FOMO that drives tech stocks & cryptocurrencies present-day. Unrest in Iran, aggressive money flow from investors & reports of cold weather probs at refiners have resulted in price hikes #OOTT
871 2018-01-03 17:28:53 Yeah I don't watch my stocks day to day really cos I'm always looking for long term (5-20yr) investments so that's cool with me
872 2018-01-03 17:27:40 These guys will boost stocks in the first days to proof trump is right. Before they'll fill their pockets in the long-term.
873 2018-01-03 17:27:26 On Fox Biz News today @ 2:35. Tune in! Another day another record for stocks. Can they go higher? Yes. Today's ISM mfg. and global purchasing manager surveys show business is booming. Straight up? No but a set back is unlikely to derail this bull market under these conditions.
874 2018-01-03 17:26:54 Later on you can trade your stock in for money when stocks are high
875 2018-01-03 17:26:12 Very different from stocks where the sell button is on a hair trigger and all shares are sitting in a brokerage account at all times.
876 2018-01-03 17:26:00 Started investing in stocks and I'm starting to see some growth  it's nice watching that money grow!
877 2018-01-03 17:25:22 But stocks and crypto are completely different things. Owning crypto only gives you crypto. Owning stock gives you rights enforceable by law.
878 2018-01-03 17:25:02 Don't be the investor who regrets not taking profits when the FAANG stocks pull back. Rebalance your portfolio while you still have time.

890 2018-01-03 17:20:03 The arrogance and entitlement from these cranky old stocks is baffling.
891 2018-01-03 17:19:39 Also, if we take equities as an example, there's a higher correlation between the ISM and yoy EPS growth than GDP and yoy EPS growth (in terms of timing and magnitude). Over time, stocks move with earnings, and thus ISM has done a better job of moving with equities than GDP...
892 2018-01-03 17:19:29 Should be paraded through the streets in stocks.

“I have no stocks. I advise people not to invest in the stock market, not now. Way too dangerous.” 
Filmmaker Michael Moore, August 2017.
896 2018-01-03 17:17:25 For investors, this doesn't seem to be the case. Stocks (similar to other assets) are leading indicators & thus move in line with other leading indicators like ISM. The question is how much higher can the ISM move (given its mean reverting nature) & what's expected by consensus?

909 2018-01-03 17:11:40 The interesting thing is that the internal EU market is not pricing like a market that has a lack of demand. Feed demand is well up IMO. Some ethanol capacity back on stream too. I agree, exports will probably fall but stocks will not rise 1:1 IMHO.

945 2018-01-03 16:59:39 that is an issue with most active ETFs, (I know this one isn’t), and it doesn’t help that roughly half the AUM is invested in penny/OTC equivalent stocks…

950 2018-01-03 16:57:30 Regarding stocks. Stocks created a new way of creating wealth/value. Stocks have done so much good for all of us.

Bitcoin brings the same dream of creating another channel of wealth. If not Bitcoin maybe some other crypto; but I wonder how much good it create with more abundance
951 2018-01-03 16:57:03 I and many other gun owners don't think that. I have sent letters supporting a ban on bump stocks and improvements in data sharing for background checks. Not everyone is an NRA nutjob. I think it's important to be intellectually honest about things.

953 2018-01-03 16:56:21 The same data is available for AIM stocks....the companies are smaller so you have a much better chance of meeting & speaking to management.

963 2018-01-03 16:53:15 I’ve used Fanatics before and they’re good but they don’t have some of the items which the Steelers store stocks plus buying from the official store pumps money back into the club I guess.

968 2018-01-03 16:49:50 Of the 5 major tax categories for valuation, the big visible one, Trump tax cuts,naturally boosted stocks. However, the other 4 categories will become more important and very beneficial for stocks in Fusion Stage 2 Super Bull Market
969 2018-01-03 16:49:41 One report on Macau has somehow sent domestic casino stocks into a tizzy as well.  I am going to buy more of these on Friday.
970 2018-01-03 16:49:16 Market Wrap Jan 3, 2018:
The equity market depreciated today by 0.20%, largely attributable to Dangote Cement. There was a sustained demand for banking stocks, most of which traded at the higher limit and closed on bid. The Bond market witnessed a renewed buying interest.

979 2018-01-03 16:45:50 @AnthonySilard where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
980 2018-01-03 16:45:18 Yes it is. And Canadian marijuana stocks gonna continue to pump out green for at least another year.
981 2018-01-03 16:45:07 (1/2) When I talk about the companies I invest in, you’ll be able to rattle off hundreds of bad things about them—but that’s why they’re cheap! The most common comment I get is ‘Don’t you read the paper?’ Because if you read the paper, there’s no way you’d buy these stocks.

993 2018-01-03 16:41:07 Hard to tell. Greenspan went "pro gold" after leaving Fed. But bulk of Yellen and Bernanke's wealth tied to stocks.
994 2018-01-03 16:40:49 From my experience IB will let you sell "@value" stocks if you hold 'em, but won't let you buy them

996 2018-01-03 16:39:59 On today's @WBBMNewsradio Noon Business Hour, what is the January effect and will it hit stocks this year, why do gas prices keep rising, and Personal Finance Wednesday: should you rebalance after last year's great year for stocks? Join us!
997 2018-01-03 16:39:59 Thank you.  I took a summer many years ago going over finances with my kids.  My son saves; one daughter loves stocks and the other is going live at home for the rest of her life with her animals.
998 2018-01-03 16:39:48 When it comes to pot stocks, there are a few certainties: 

1) Most are scams that will be out of business in a year or two.

2) Buy low in around September/October and hold through Feb/March/April.

3) Buy the tickers with the best ticker symbol "names" ($WEED, $BUDZ, $NUGS etc)
999 2018-01-03 16:39:13 It's going to bubble again and all the big players are going to pull their stocks.  Might as well push it to the breaking point for maximum profits and use the deregulated and stripped Dodd/Frank to make out like bandits.  They're doing it in record time.

1014 2018-01-03 16:33:37 $WEED and $ACB, Canadian stocks are my shorts right now. On the lookout for a "fake" crack like we saw in some of these weed stocks on the 29th. These guys are due for a decent selloff though.
1015 2018-01-03 16:33:15 Only in America would the media continue to talk about the “royal” wedding, yet not a peep about bump stocks.
1016 2018-01-03 16:32:58 I'm quite into bitcoin. The same reason speculating on stocks isn't illegal I suppose. Could you eloborate? Why the question?
1017 2018-01-03 16:32:43 Thank you for being an ardent fan of our guilt-free snacks. We are working towards increasing our availability in the months to come. Big Bazaar, Tesco, Metro C&C and Hypercity should have larger stocks of our products.

1019 2018-01-03 16:31:26 RBC Direct Investing has been down all morning. Pot stocks are poppin'. Can't make trades. So frustrating.

1022 2018-01-03 16:29:53 I bought all of them in 2016. Most of what I’ve invested in are pharmaceutical stocks that are developing cannabis based cancer and epilepsy drugs, not recreational pot stocks. CBDS is mostly weed tech. I’m not worried.

1043 2018-01-03 16:19:49 Yes. But you could argue if you can properly identify fraud you can wait. Stocks don't go to zero in a day. As story emerges you can press. Takes patience and you have to be right.

1049 2018-01-03 16:17:14 also help drive stocks higher as overseas earnings increase relative to lower costs of production in the US - This could become a greater driver of stock prices later this year if the US falls 10 - 20% stocks could rise by the same amount and of course Gold & Silver also benefit

1057 2018-01-03 16:15:14 In the end, truth is: With the stocks of individual companies…

Unless and until fraud is proven, investors and the companies themselves create their own realities until the companies stand up and concede what appears to be…ISN’T. All bets off until that point.

1073 2018-01-03 16:09:03 I think the optimal place is to have enough money not to worry about money anymore, but not to have so much money that it causes more worries.

1074 2018-01-03 16:08:54 So far 2018 is off to a flying start as stocks emulate the post election liftoff which boosted stocks all of 2017 and could bode exceedingly well for 2018. Stocks have been on a tear going back to Election Day, reflecting investors’ optimism over the U.S. economy, tax cuts & dreg
1075 2018-01-03 16:08:45 Made 400%, 146% and 216% on 3 Canadian medical marijuana stocks over 2 months. Going to continue to be one of the fastest growing sectors in the world the next few years

1078 2018-01-03 16:07:45 I buy and sell stocks- big difference. As you put it these fake currencies have a following. That’s the fascinating part. And no one can even explain what it is. Maybe dollar has issues. But crypto is crazy. Concept good , value not so good. There is more harm in crypto than +
1079 2018-01-03 16:07:12 Pot stocks rolling over
1080 2018-01-03 16:07:09 actually, prices black markets for growers will virtually be eliminated (street sales will come from store stocks) while decriminalization makes arrests (for pot) nearly unheard of. it's not the future need to worry about (save for monopolies) but the past ravages of war on drugs

1084 2018-01-03 16:05:37 Back up your saves of what you write. Stop trying to save people from themselves. Stick with computer programming, get a hold of Sean Murray, pitch a bunch of games to him. Buy stocks in Amazon. Take care of your knees. Apparently aliens are real. None of that shit was ur fault.
1085 2018-01-03 16:05:36 You wrote "He JUST sold a lot of stock". But It already several months ago, which gives a false impression. A more appropiate tweet would be "Intel CEO sold a lot of stocks in November" :-)

1088 2018-01-03 16:04:49 Experience is incredibly valuable in the investing world. I sold Blackberry and cannabis stocks on FOMO on profits (also want to reallocate/get some dry keg powder). A small profit is better than no profit, but that's a tough lesson to swallow.

1093 2018-01-03 16:03:58 I had a #MiFIDII surprise today. All European stocks have had their minimum price increments changed, for pointless regulatory reasons it seems. IB rejecting lots of my orders today
1094 2018-01-03 16:03:38 Perhaps. And I think people that took mortgages out to jump in are insane, but there is money to be made for smart traders as usual. Your fascination with the “scam” aspect is what throws me off when you clearly like stocks that scream scam. To each his own.
1095 2018-01-03 16:03:38 I’m buying some of their stocks the first day it’s public and then selling the next day when it gets super expensive on the hype (before it crashes down on the third day). Learned my lesson with snap ipo.

1097 2018-01-03 16:03:09 @todd_harrison Congratulations, Todd. I know that you've been investing in cannibis stocks for years now. I should have listened to you. I certainly agree with your "better than Bitcoin" hypothesis.

1100 2018-01-03 16:01:20 If you made investments in Cannabis stocks last year, good for you!
1101 2018-01-03 16:01:13 It will be interesting. I kind of compare this to $HPNN. Both stocks that can be game changers but at the same time do many pump fakes.

1107 2018-01-03 15:58:56 Adorable Deplorables. If trump had improved their lot, they’d brag about that instead of tilting at year old windmills. 

Anybody not already a millionaire doing better because of trump? How’s your 401K? Got one? Stocks? Debts? Health insurance?
1108 2018-01-03 15:58:20 It has been proven over and over that no one can predict stocks with any great success.

1110 2018-01-03 15:57:00 I think the hilarious part is that you think crypto is a scam, but $AZFL is a winner. The key here is that it is a decentralized store of value given value by the marketplace. And it can’t be diluted to death the way stocks like $AZFL are.
1111 2018-01-03 15:56:55 Cannabis stocks are on an absolute tear :O

1238 2018-01-03 15:23:11 The only good thing I can add here is that I have traded most of the stocks in the screener just around the trigger price mentioned here. Bought Graphite at 90, GoaCarbon at 50ish, Bom Dyeing around 60 etc.

1372 2018-01-03 14:44:59 There's now an ETF called $DOGS -- Unfortunately it's not a play on man's best friend or even dog-related crypto currencies, it's a play on buying the worst performing international stocks in hopes of mean reversion.

1415 2018-01-03 14:33:45 Completely agree, the incoming normally takes 3 years to show impact from current presidency.

1422 2018-01-03 14:31:02 The only way you owe from stocks is if you sell them. If you’re claiming 0 you’re saying that someone else is supporting you financially i’m pretty sure.

1425 2018-01-03 14:29:40 I claim 0. I think it’s from my stocks.

1448 2018-01-03 14:18:35 @jimcramer great show last night, especially the segment on how this incredible rally still lacks appreciation. Everybody’s pouring into bitcoin not stocks.
1449 2018-01-03 14:18:27 Yes, this definitely proves that AVERAGE global temperatures are not increasing, after all. In other news, the fact that one of my stocks is down today proves the stock market isn't gaining.
1450 2018-01-03 14:18:07 12 minutes to TSX TSXV CSE casinos opening.

1463 2018-01-03 14:13:32 I thought the exact same thing. Stocks don't finish anywhere near 3k with 4 hikes this year
1464 2018-01-03 14:13:30 Yeah. They said stocks would plummet if he was elected, but when they grew it wasn't due to him at all. Not saying it 100% is, but he certainly isn't hurting.

You better create timing for profits better than profits are gone.  If the stock continues rising, so what? already got profit
1537 2018-01-03 13:40:09 This applies to trading. When buying stocks ask yourself.

2028 2018-01-03 07:22:46 Let’s break it down. Oil prices have become helpful to growth because America is the 3rd largest producer. In general increasing commodity prices caused inflation which is the usual catalyst for recessions. Low inflation did help stocks and the economy in 2017.

2034 2018-01-03 07:17:54 yes, my opinion on market cap. these are not stocks. especially for new coins, the market cap is really just a number. you can compare it of course with other coins and make assumptions, but in one week, your calculation will be obsolete. look closely at $ADA evolution.

2068 2018-01-03 06:46:42 Agreed! Strong correlation between support for independence and stock market. My guess is the psychology dates back to the post-Darien bailout from England. "Better together when times are bad". Bold when stocks up. CBH / DB may recall my (non) piece.
2069 2018-01-03 06:46:41 That's not buying anything tangible.  That just artificially inflates the stock market.  The vast majority of society does not own stocks.

2288 2018-01-03 04:18:49 Of course: all income, by whatever means, should be taxed! And when they see these stocks, they should also be taxed on the capital gains. Why would it be any other way? I expect the Liberal party to address this immediately!

2318 2018-01-03 04:05:42 Yesh, just like sipping a cup of hot cocoa. Works. Every friend I've recommended it to, verifies its efficacy. Bone broths or stocks are incredible flavorings when cooking foods, such as rice cooked in bone broth, but the broth binds with the food and is not fully absorbed..
2319 2018-01-03 04:05:19 Crazy day for some traders. Marijuana stocks are up 30% and Crypto well you know Crypto 30% is an average day as billions are being pumped into the latest #fintech and #Blockchain tech. Good times. $DOGE $BTC $XVG $XRP etc

So society learns to associate shitcoins with penny stocks, time shares, mlm scams, and immediately dismisses them.

2542 2018-01-03 01:41:54 LARE - Tierra XP Latin America Real Estate ETF is now MJX - ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF ....a stock trading in US that owns a number of our Canadian Marijuana stocks.  Mmmmm, recent gains in our MMJ stocks was b/c of this ETF??
2543 2018-01-03 01:41:42 This should be easy ... the oil companies should show they have new invoices or stocks charged with new excise tax. Otherwise, it just means they have old stocks.
2544 2018-01-03 01:39:38 Value probably most pronounced, but I could see a momentum factor where the stocks have passed additional other factors could work as well.
2545 2018-01-03 01:38:42 Great, now all of my stocks will be in the red tomorrow because of this stupid tweet.
2546 2018-01-03 01:37:37 Mining stocks trading higher at the open.
Huge divergence from local stock prices and commodity price.

Gold and nickel stocks in particular.
2547 2018-01-03 01:37:26 $NVDA buying more tomorrow 
2548 2018-01-03 01:37:13 $GPRO RSI in the 20's bought a little  at 7.50 will buy more under 7. Should bounce soon

2552 2018-01-03 01:34:46 The new tax bill. Has a big wedge on daytrading. Is why I stop this year after my last trade with RMHB. The rest of my stocks are long term for 2 or 3 years.
2553 2018-01-03 01:34:29 Do you buy pot stocks or no?

2556 2018-01-03 01:32:14 It's a road being built to a busy golf course. There's 100s of examples of resorts having new directly roads built. Ignorance to think the tax cut isnt great for the country. Stocks are high, bonuses were given due to this so many of the regular low income earners benefited.
2557 2018-01-03 01:31:31 same thing happened at least with dot com stocks
2558 2018-01-03 01:29:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2559 2018-01-03 01:26:43 Around this time pharmaceutical stocks are doing real healthy
2560 2018-01-03 01:26:22 Rich people care about stocks. Those you or to help are worried about paying for their children’s braces or medications.
2561 2018-01-03 01:26:11 I’ve been calling it for a few weeks now. If I was to invest into stocks I would invest into XRP-USD - Ripple USD. I bet you it is going to soar this year.
2562 2018-01-03 01:25:58 Hilarious. You obviously don’t own stocks or pay taxes. Trump = genius. Hillary = criminal. Would love to see any politician build a skyscraper from scratch, in a foreign country. Bill & Hillary have been lifelong, government thieves.
2563 2018-01-03 01:24:46 1/Well, if you can go both long and short and you see a big run up in say the tech sector that puts their valuations in the stratosphere you can short them; conversely if a big group of stocks are out of favor and very cheap you go long.
2564 2018-01-03 01:23:27 c’est vrai que ca s’impose j’en ai en stocks stv
2565 2018-01-03 01:23:12 Anyone w/ the typical diversified portfolio , has massive losses in oil , financials & retail post 08.But the indexes can add winners & drop losers in a way that a reality based portfolio can't. So they make it look like buy & hold stocks is a winner.
2566 2018-01-03 01:22:43 Money. Any and everything about money. Investing, Stocks, Bonds, 401K, RothIRA, Interest Rates & Percentages, how Taxes work...smh #IfIHadOnlyKnownWhenIWas18
2567 2018-01-03 01:21:14 Bruh. I'm up 20% today in stocks. FUCK being poor. 2018 will be the year I become independently wealthy I swear to god.
2568 2018-01-03 01:20:29 Value stocks tend to outperform in a nuclear holocaust.
2569 2018-01-03 01:20:18 Yep, invest in liquor stocks.  And pot-co-ops.
2570 2018-01-03 01:19:37 Last words...it's the dudes who did not buy their shares you have to worry about (premine, owners shares, etc).  When they dump, it is straight up dilution and it will get you #rekt .  Learned that lesson in penny stocks a decade ago.  See $XRP lol
2571 2018-01-03 01:19:23 Big step US could take to support elephant poaching in Africa: ban bump stocks...

2574 2018-01-03 01:16:43 Active managers have very different buy/sell criteria from one another. Some might like low PE stocks with high yields whereas others like us might use multifactor value composites and include metrics on quality, financial strength, etc.
2575 2018-01-03 01:16:24 Yeah, but 65% of homeowners have a mortgage. Which is fine and could be good or bad. I have a mortgage and it benefits me. But it doesn't mean RE beats stocks after costs.
2576 2018-01-03 01:15:30 $JCP $M making that comeback already but everyone was so bearish a few months ago
2577 2018-01-03 01:13:50 1st official business day of the year, and my stocks and crypto are both up! Glad I kept my stakes.
2578 2018-01-03 01:13:24 He's making sure your prediction that Jan. 2 will be year high for stocks sticks...

2580 2018-01-03 01:13:00 Damn right. I own Bitcoin when it was 989 for 138 BTC sold it at 16700. Now I own 50 BTC at 12700. The rest goes taxes this 2018 and then the rest retirement. I own btc stocks also. The correct message. Getting all hype on RMHB

2583 2018-01-03 01:11:15 Stocks plunged as Charter Communications, Inc. unveiled a plain-speaking basketball today.
2584 2018-01-03 01:11:14 Crypto is not “stupid,” it’s an avenue to wealth.

Remember that if you bought the right stocks in the “tech bubble of 1999” you’d be rich.

Anyone can study the space, learn basic trading techniques, and change their life. Like me, and countless others.

It’s just an avenue.
2585 2018-01-03 01:11:06 Yup, $burst will do a 35000% like $xrp this year.

2587 2018-01-03 01:09:15 Idk why nobody ever told me about stocks just something you gotta learn on yo own
2588 2018-01-03 01:08:36 Gotta admit, my stocks are doing great. Thanks to Obama and then Trump for not screwing it up.

If you don't have stock investments, maybe Wall Street will give you a helping hand. But I doubt it. They're gonna funnel the tax money to shareholders.

2592 2018-01-03 01:06:43 I mean I‘ve owned Gold $GC_F since lows last year... for a moment everyone “jumping in now after such a rally” makes me nervous, but then again, look at what Copper did, & Stocks, & Cryptos... I guess trend is your friend & you need people to keep jumping in— to keep it going.
2593 2018-01-03 01:06:04 $MJX this is gonna be one of those berkshire type stocks where youre like $200,000 for 1 stock?
2594 2018-01-03 01:05:53 did you say short stocks?
2595 2018-01-03 01:05:50 HSGFX was flat today- proves he doesn't believe his own lies about a 65% drop in stocks.
2596 2018-01-03 01:05:07 Geechie woukd be a classic and raise bouf y’all stocks
2597 2018-01-03 01:04:47 Now playing: NOFX / Jeff Wears Birken-stocks
2598 2018-01-03 01:03:17 And $CPG and $TCW are running away for Canadian stocks.  $NAL.TO is building a support base so I will probably re-add positions this week.  Everything is finally looking good.  Q4's will just the beginning of a lengthy run by the looks of it!
2599 2018-01-03 01:02:48 Money is a store of value and that’s why it is always backed by some assets. Even stocks and bonds are asset backed. What backs bitcoin’s value vis-a-vis $? The only thing I can find is perception. Can perception change,- happened many times in the past
2600 2018-01-03 01:01:42 Lie about tax cut, and less jobs in last 12 months than the 3 years before... Smaller% increase in stocks also. You are losing, and trump is going away for good
2601 2018-01-03 00:59:28 Stocks && Bonds All 2018 
2602 2018-01-03 00:58:28 This has got to be bullish for stocks
2603 2018-01-03 00:57:24 Why would I care if CCA and GEO's stocks tank? After years of taking money from them, HRC finally did an about face. Professor Davis gave a comprehensive plan for abolishing prison labor. Imagine believing you need a specific "plan" to end slavery. Take action!
2604 2018-01-03 00:57:13 FED raised rates 3 times last year & going to raise few more this year... so I think Treasuries/Bonds should be heading lower... I don’t think that’s how you hedge against “Stocks dropping” — it’s going to be in #Gold, #VIX, $JPY & diversifying into other alternative investments!
2605 2018-01-03 00:56:49 Selling $RGC this morning makes the remaining stocks in my portfolio look like underperformers for sure.
2606 2018-01-03 00:56:29 It makes you wonder how real are #crypto prices... If stocks, that are not as user friendly and definitely not millennial, soar when mentioning blockchain, how inflated are cryptos?
2607 2018-01-03 00:56:22 Great! Mad men with world altering weapons! What’s the point of my stocks doing so well if you push the fuckin button Trump!
2608 2018-01-03 00:56:07 "Stocks can stay over-valued or under-valued for much longer than most think. Markets are liquidity driven, not valuation driven." 

Forget #Fundamentals #Economy #Growth #Data ....All fraud in India
Just watch Fund flow ,US Dollar movement !!
#SIP in India biggest scam !!!
2609 2018-01-03 00:54:41 It will get a bounce but that's not what gold is really about. Gold is theoretically more necessary in peace time b/c there is no capital being destroyed. The peace time savings glut squeezes the marginal profit opportunity out of everything (stocks/bonds/RE)
2610 2018-01-03 00:53:59 What is to protest? This is laughable. Economy going great, stocks at all times high, embassy moving to Jerusalem, ISIS has no more territory, consumer confidence at all time high, black unemployment at all time low, take home pay will be higher in February.  Did I miss anything?

2612 2018-01-03 00:53:24 I have been buying penny stocks in the industry and I am very interested in investing
2613 2018-01-03 00:52:49 So tempting to invest in Oil and Gas right now. Stocks like $AVE.v and $SNS.v really catch my eye. The fact they are trading at such cheap multiples convince me the production will lag and we will see $100 oil in the next 1-2 years.
2614 2018-01-03 00:52:35 stocks up a lot overnight. been selling into rally. ho ho ho
2615 2018-01-03 00:52:31 In for a large chunk of KWG today. Few 2 cent stocks with a as much attention. Sometime you need to NOT run with the herd. Check KWG out I think you will find the story compelling.
2616 2018-01-03 00:51:54 Asian stocks notched moderate gains on Wednesday while the dollar remained on the back foot.
2617 2018-01-03 00:51:49 Total bullshit! Companies will buy back stocks, hoard profits and lay workers off anyway. Tax bill benefit the rich and nobody else. Ruining our country one step at a time
2618 2018-01-03 00:50:43 4th Qtr Insights, by Morningstar's J. Glaser: Stocks continued their climb in the 4th quarter as the tax bill became reality & upbeat economic data gave the green light to the Fed to raise rates again. Morningstar's US Market Index rose nearly 11% and has gained over 28% in 2017.

2621 2018-01-03 00:48:36 Does anyone know if one can #invest in #stocks directly with #bitcoin or any other #CryptoCurrencies ? If there is no such token/project, then there should be one.
2622 2018-01-03 00:47:57 What I love about this so much is that #Gold has been able to rally without “taking #Stocks down”. Both benefiting from perception of inflation to come, as the U.S. Dollar trickles lower & lower... inversely this will bid up #commodities #stocks and other USD denominated markets!
2623 2018-01-03 00:47:26 Trump has not passed any economic growth or boosting bills. Yes the stock market has continued its upward trend but high stock values mean nothing to your average consumers that drive the economy. They simply don't own stocks. 

Trump is just riding Obama's economic success.

2630 2018-01-03 00:40:04 I feel smarter now. Imma go trade stocks
2631 2018-01-03 00:39:02 I think its a non-story (I hate Comey and would love to see him in jail), because I think every Director should not have stocks in any company. A 401k is fine, managed by a money manager, but stocks are the kind of things you feel close to. I hope this was just coincidence.
2632 2018-01-03 00:38:45 What about bump stocks?
2633 2018-01-03 00:38:27 Finna start getting into these stocks
2634 2018-01-03 00:38:06  2017's hottest stocks emerge
2635 2018-01-03 00:37:54 I'd be fine with a plastic bag ban, and go out and by paper stocks.
2636 2018-01-03 00:36:37 TRAIN law increased Stock Transaction Tax from 1/2 of 1% to 6/10 of 1% of the GSP of shares of stocks sold, bartered, exchanged, or otherwise disposed.

2640 2018-01-03 00:33:50 Possibly MOST IMPORTANT  reason to strengthen US..gun laws.  CLOSE  THE GUN  SHOW LOOPHOLE  , Require Gun Owners To  insure their weapons.   Ban bump stocks. Vote for candidates who will enact these common sense gun laws
2641 2018-01-03 00:32:17 This is the real reason a lot of them voted for him to put us in our place but unlike them we are great at adversity.  I still have my job with benefits, stocks,  health insurance $25 a week, yearly raises, and my beautiful 4 bedroom/3 bathroom home. Jokes on them.
2642 2018-01-03 00:31:51 Definitely buying me Facebook stocks
2643 2018-01-03 00:30:45 Naninibago na ko sa stocks after days of no trading. 
2644 2018-01-03 00:30:29 Jeff Sessions was confirmed Atty General and immediately stocks in private prisons such as Geo Group soared.
2645 2018-01-03 00:27:05 My favorite @WarrenBuffett quote on that subject is that being glad when stocks go up in price because you own some is like being glad when the price of gas goes up because you have a tankful of it in your car.
2646 2018-01-03 00:26:52 Maybe stocks WOULD be down, but I SURE wouldn't be living in fear of N. K. nuking us!
2647 2018-01-03 00:26:06 You could saw that again, was walking around in a t-shirt in AZ while it was -40 Celcius (incl. wind factor) in MTL... If only my timing was that good with stocks I’d be a heck of a trader!
2648 2018-01-03 00:25:50 The only thing I'll ever do with my jackpot money is put it in the bank, as well as into stocks.
2649 2018-01-03 00:25:39 2017 was a batting pitch to score but 2018 will be a bowling pitch & difficult to score. So investors need be extremely selective while picking stocks. This is because structural changes took place in 2017 but high interest rates could pull down the profits of companies #lka
2650 2018-01-03 00:24:13 The stocks market & investing is becoming a real interest of mine ..
2651 2018-01-03 00:23:09 And this is why im investing in Canadian pot stocks
2652 2018-01-03 00:22:29 Better spend the subsidy on, improving the underground water level, building roofs over food grains stocks lying in the open, building night shelters for homeless people, improving health care and educational infrastructure.
2653 2018-01-03 00:22:25 Energy stocks have been behind so far, not caught up with WTI/Brent rerate, is that normal for a lag?
2654 2018-01-03 00:22:20 I started with one stock 15 years back and that rewarded me very well. It was #HDFCBank Now I have many profit and growth stocks in my portfolio, but without HDFC Bank, I would have not been in the position Iam now. Its still my favourite and I have many shares of #HDFCBank
2655 2018-01-03 00:22:08 Great! So, it’s going parabolic! Buy more stocks  of course. This is not something i would even contemplate when investing other prople’s money. Times have changed

2659 2018-01-03 00:18:04 Thanks Jim. Historically we have seen similar effects in Australian shares when banks or resources stocks go above 30% of the ASX 200. Effects are more pronounced because the ASX 200 is more concentrated.

2685 2018-01-03 00:03:34 Now I’m sad that we don’t have a Carvel store anywhere nearby anymore. Fudgie the Whale is my favorite, but Kroger only stocks the regular Carvel cakes.  Which are still good, don’t get me wrong, but Fudgie is next level goodness!
2686 2018-01-03 00:03:00 There are many great books out there. A book that REALLY hammers home minimum earnings/revenue constraints & chart patterns is "Trade Like a Market Wizard" by @markminervini   Buy it. STUDY it. $$$ in those pages. #stocks #investing
