48 2018-05-06 23:11:33 I just jumped in here. I should have been more careful. There was a story in the paper about a legal secretary who died and left a fortune to charity. I am asking about the comment that she bought the same stocks as her boss did. No biggie.
49 2018-05-06 23:11:30 Ill thought and emotional decision. However prohibitions of detachable stocks, requiring universal background checks, fixed magazines (for pistols), a 3 day wait, and 30+1 rd maximum, (even ban on flash suppressor/silencer combinations. I support, however our aim is off.

Laws that prohibit detachable stocks, and assault specific accessories, background checks, 3 day wait, 22+ and even mags over 30+1 rds prohibited...I agree with. However banning entire categories of weapons particularly when the other kills

57 2018-05-06 22:56:15 Life goes on despite us---there is still jewelry to buy clothes to wear and stocks to trade.
58 2018-05-06 22:54:49 people are primarily the victims should NEVER take precedent away from thousands and thousands of innocent black and brown people who will be victims of pistol violence because you can hide them, high capacity mags, etc. rifles if they don’t have detachable stocks...like shotguns
59 2018-05-06 22:53:28 Maybe you should look less at Bitcoin stocks & instead invest in learning about current societal issues that might effect your own children. Maybe look up why certain artists use their platform to portray things that are fucked up, through irony & satire! This isn’t a new thing.

64 2018-05-06 22:48:44 Interesting! They want to "restrict" bump stocks. What does that even mean? They want to do it through the ATF. Bump stocks need to be banned and it needs to be done through Congress out in the open. If it's done through the ATF it can just as easily be undone.
65 2018-05-06 22:46:25 In 6th grade I was in challenge math class. We did a project where we picked stocks & followed them 4 a time. At the end we saw who had earned $. Also, a stock broker came 2 talk 2 us. Didn't fully understand what stocks were but I enjoyed it. Wish they had built on it every yr.
66 2018-05-06 22:45:38 @fishthesalt @dbongino why y’all dodging my q? Bump Stocks and High Capacity Magazines are  necessary for personal/community safety? Come now act like men and discuss.

73 2018-05-06 22:36:10 I joined in Tim’s challenge a week ago, going through the DVD’s but it will take at least a month or more to complete all of them. I was wondering should I buy the stocks to trade tool now or wait a month?
74 2018-05-06 22:35:34 Happens to me all the time. I'm shit at trading momentum even when high conviction in direction because I don't know where to place my SL and thus define my risk. Worth noting I trade FX, not stocks.
75 2018-05-06 22:34:21 It’s nice to see stocks not following the market last week.
76 2018-05-06 22:32:39 Running out of social media apps to procrastinate with, I’m having the time of my life on the apps that come  with the iPhone like stocks and compass 
77 2018-05-06 22:32:15 Iv been saying this again and again. People should be grateful crypto exists. Most people are ungrateful. Apparently they never tried investing in stocks or bonds. Super low returns
78 2018-05-06 22:31:59 you spend a lot of time thinking about waste stocks and aggregates too, huh?

81 2018-05-06 22:31:02 It's easier when you're used to avoiding stuff, also makes it easier that they want to focus Elegant because he's the one tilting them by getting dumb early stocks

This is also why I say "I ran away for 6 sets and won $230 nice"
82 2018-05-06 22:30:05 You apear to have your mind closed to the possibility of compromise. 

Reasonable gun safety legislation is not the same thing as taking away all guns.
1. No bump stocks
2. No AR15s or equivalent
3. Universal background checks
4. Red flag laws
5. Ammo restrictions
83 2018-05-06 22:28:36 Sigh...my royal master, the once glorious King Lear, now his servant put to the stocks by his daughter’s husband. Oh! What a humiliation to royal authority! Villain Oswald! Tyranny Cornwall! God bless the King and his faithful Cordelia #hope #Godblesstheking

88 2018-05-06 22:20:34 but just because it's scaled doesn't mean he's not affected, right? isn't he still considered to have a heavy stock advantage because three other players have less stocks, scaling his aura down at all times?
89 2018-05-06 22:19:21 I cannot believe Cornwall would place one of my servants in the stocks, especially when I, the King, did not order it. This is betrayal at its finest...
90 2018-05-06 22:18:12 Literally all the people who are upset about the government banning bump stocks already know how to drill a hole in their AR-15 to make it into an automatic anyways, so I really don't know what they're so upset about.
91 2018-05-06 22:13:41 Yeah I'm quite sure the FBI knows bump stocks are worthless and the effect can be achieved with a rubber band.  But sure see something say something. 

Clown.

97 2018-05-06 22:05:14 Obama allowed bump stocks because he hoped it would create mass shootings while he was still in office so that he could ban guns. When that didn't work, he politicized police departments, Sheriffs, FBI, CIA to use mentally ill by ignoring warning signs.
98 2018-05-06 22:05:00 I think the Dems are in trouble but msm won’t tell us that! They are broke financially; They have no platform and can only appeal to socialist! Korean War over, stocks  6k, unemployment historic , taxe, Isis crushed, military strong! Democrats only have Russia!
99 2018-05-06 22:04:46 I bought some  cdn lumber stocks four years ago and sold them soon after as they weren’t moving much. Totally regret that now.
100 2018-05-06 22:02:35 If it was made 21 w exception of those who went into criminal justice it would also be an enticement for those people to enlist in the military. I understand the logic behind magazines and definitely bump stocks but at this point those aren’t being sold anymore. 6/
101 2018-05-06 22:02:00 **Semi-political tweet**
The 10 year mark is coming up in the economic cycle, meaning that pretty soon, stock market is going to go down, inflation is going to happen and prices are getting ready to significantly increase. Now is the time to pull stocks if you have any and..
102 2018-05-06 22:00:47 Really?
103 2018-05-06 22:00:43 Reasonable gun regulation does not call for banning all guns-Why are bump stocks that slaughtered dozens in Vegas legal?
104 2018-05-06 21:56:55 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $AAN, $CCE, $COF, $FCX, all may climb w/in 23, 19, 15, 24 days up to 7.1%, 4.5%, 3.7%, 14.5% respectively 
105 2018-05-06 21:56:17 Bump stocks were so obscure before Vegas; few even knew they were available. Now, they've sold a ton. I am all for banning them. It's a lame idea anyway. Bump stocks cause the AR-15 unreliably jumpy & to fire at that rate, heats it up & quickly melts the gas tube. Danger & Waste.

107 2018-05-06 21:55:41 My local model shop stocks a product called plasticard. Amazon stock it too. I’d recommend 40 thousandths of an inch thickness as 20 thou is too flimsy. Score the sheet heavily with a knife and the snap it is easy or cut all the way through if you prefer.
108 2018-05-06 21:54:20 Common sense gun laws are all expanded background checks, wait periods, age, magazine, gun show loophole & bump stocks. Which the NRA started the NICS program and now they agree it needs to be fixed. Some states already have wait times. Most states don’t deal w the loop hole. 4/

129 2018-05-06 21:32:31 First, you cited Vox, an activist journalism site. That source is biased and should not be taken seriously. Two, bump stocks are legal because a clever engineer found a way to make a device that bypassed the laws. The NRA can't legalize something that was never legal.
130 2018-05-06 21:31:54 I got an alert saying @DaleJr liked a tweet and now I don't want to clear it. Actually met him and @AmyEarnhardt along with @ReganSmith once when I worked at NASCAR Tech during a Stocks For Tots event & all were as friendly as could be.

134 2018-05-06 21:25:00 FTSE Futures have rallied for 6 weeks in a row, adding 11.1%, making it the biggest 6 week gain seen in the 91 weeks since 5 Aug-16. The run has extended to 7 weeks only once in at least 21 years, the exception coming on 26 Mar-10, 424 weeks ago (when it lasted 9 weeks) #stocks

137 2018-05-06 21:21:28 hmmm ... Manu, ich habe doch das Buch als linearen Text geschrieben. Ich meine, dass man den Text der Reihe nach lesen sollte, weil die Argumentation aufbauend ist. Es handelt sich um eine Modellierung in der Systemdynamics-Sprache mit Stocks and Flows, wobei Material fliesst.

140 2018-05-06 21:20:23 Which the anti gun folks like to use as an example, except that there is nothing inherently more dangerous or unusual about what you are referring to as an "assault rifle". Pistol grips,muzzle devices, adjustable stocks & bayonet lugs don't constitute lethality.

144 2018-05-06 21:16:55 Stock Market. There's different types of "levels" in stocks,  so acorns is just safer for people who want to invest,  but not a lot of money. You can invest how much you want every 2 weeks.
145 2018-05-06 21:14:50 Living isn't easy in doubles.  I'm always impressed when there's just one dude late in the match who STILL has 3 stocks and you're pretty good at that so kudos.

150 2018-05-06 21:09:12 It's kind of like a retirement savings, but better than a savings because with savings you dont earn anything. And this is better than investing in stocks because you don't lose money if stock crashes.

156 2018-05-06 20:55:37 how dare he say obama wrecked economy. Shame on him. USA was in a recession. Stocks were 8000. 19000 when he left office. Unemployment was 11% and 4.6 when he left. How stupid is he.    how cruel. Shame on him
157 2018-05-06 20:51:59 Absolutely. Bringing a more complicated stock market system compared to the one in RRP1. Actual businesses and stores in East Brickton will impact the market and however many players purchase from that store will cause the value of its stocks to increase.
158 2018-05-06 20:51:59 Chelsea have changed. Their business model now is just as much about selling for profit as it is buying. They treat football like stocks and shares. They invest in players and hope to reap a profit. Days of investing only for football success are over.

165 2018-05-06 20:39:17 Corps are buying a lot of stocks! From where you are, your tax breaks are definitely making a impact on you. For most of us, not so much. Saying it more often, doesn’t make it so.

170 2018-05-06 20:33:30 Been thinking/reading about level of concentration in portfolio. I’m currently at 62 stocks & appreciate this will prob drag on performance.

185 2018-05-06 20:18:30 Carry licenses were baby steps to the advent of constitutional carry in many states, all with the backing of the NRA. among others.

Bump stocks are of no interest to me. If you want to waste money, go the NFA route and find a true fully automatic.

What high capacity bans?

192 2018-05-06 20:08:49 Se comieron todos los stocks de la economía sin generar nuevos, descerebraron 2 generaciones, agotaron la capacidad energética, terminaron con un PIB industrial menor que el de 1998. Y parte de lo que se afanaron se encontró cuando uno de sus ministros lo tiraba en un convento.
193 2018-05-06 20:08:07 Honestly can’t believe the amount of belief in a company with this model... Value stocks are where it’s at or at least a spec play with something innovative
194 2018-05-06 20:07:39 Are stocks cheapest than bonds?
195 2018-05-06 20:06:14 OKAY IM LVL 10 AND DID THE STOCKS WILL RISE THIS SUMMER
196 2018-05-06 20:04:43 And helps many hundreds of thousands (if not millions) get off the growth-preventing cycle that is living off the government. Have you seen the jobs numbers? Unemployment rate? GDP growth? Stocks? Support of female leadership? Hes been incredible so far.

Also, draining the swamp
197 2018-05-06 20:03:09 Je t'encourage vraiment alors à laisser les stocks bien lourds là-bas, oui! Dans une valise, placée sur une chaise sous la table, bien caché et pas trop "attire l’œil" *~*

205 2018-05-06 19:59:54 There is a VAST difference of having guns for protection and being responsible than allowing military weapons, bump stocks, AK's and AR15's on the streets. This is a problem. It is something that those screaming Second Amendment while they cover up their ears and don't listen.
206 2018-05-06 19:59:05 Much cooler than your crocs & stocks
207 2018-05-06 19:58:53 you're dreaming. there is a poitical storm brewing. loan payments delayed. subprime lenders face problems. stocks volatile. gas prices go up. auto cos. see slowdowns. unemployment low but your neighbor just gets fired with a 1000 others. you awaken think it's 2008, but it's 2018
208 2018-05-06 19:58:42 Cashing out is simple. Many different exchanges, far more selection to cash out then stocks. And you can spend btc directly. Don't even need to cash out, can't spend stocks.
209 2018-05-06 19:58:23 If the stocks haven’t yet been bought and transport arranged they’ll not reach the export channels by June
210 2018-05-06 19:57:56 Most S&P500 stocks that grow at 10% a year don't pay dividends, if they do high dividend is 2.5%, making $250 a year on $10,000 investment. Pales in comparison to #bitcoins growth, always have a diversified portfolio but #cryptocurrency has performed far greater the last 10 years

213 2018-05-06 19:57:04 It doesn't help that ammonium nitrate production capability can also be used for plenty of munitions and for hydrazine based rocket fuel.  Might be that certain stocks are being sent to the weapons program instead of the fertilizer program?
214 2018-05-06 19:55:36 I think you gotta keep the recordings pretty short, maybe the stocks were too long?

217 2018-05-06 19:50:04 Get away from the ledge @C9Mang0 please! You died below 80% almost all your stocks. It hurts seeing the birds wings get clipped like that. :(
218 2018-05-06 19:49:49 Stocks are so hyper-analyzed that no person can pick good ones and only algorhythms will do.

223 2018-05-06 19:45:26 "extra rights" is open carrying a gun. As we don't allow that in CA and it's long been tested by the court as not being a 2A right.
Bump stocks, High-cap mags & that you don't have to be Universally Background Checked and on buying ammo. More "extra rights" not allowed in CA.
224 2018-05-06 19:45:01 But if pensions are deferred pay, should not NI apply to that pay? I say that tongue in cheek because care funding gap needs to be closed by a combination of changes to IHT, Income tax and NI. Worry is politicians will pile the load onto the least vote sensitive "tax".

226 2018-05-06 19:43:19 The idea is for criminals not to have anything. Do you have a link that states their official position on bump stocks? Where the NRA stands on certain issues seems to depend on who they talk to. The way Dana Loesch spoke at the town hall was different from her CPAC speech.

233 2018-05-06 19:30:48 So present something other than index with high sharpe ratio, a Long track record, and a better return, with a few things in it. NOT “real estate” or “these 5 stocks” or “a HF” (avg joe can’t get in) If not, rest is just “noise”    I’ll wait. Will be VERY HARD to do so

Quit listening to the NRA and listen to what the American people want.. comprehensive background checks, add those on FBI Watch list and No Fly list to those who cannot buy guns, ban bump stocks and assault style guns. If you’re a law abiding person.. no worry!!
241 2018-05-06 19:21:02 ...meanwhile, wish I'd bought more of this new one...a nice #Welsh produced #Tonicwater from @LlanllyrSource that has something about it!

247 2018-05-06 19:19:26 Sir, for Investment stock I keep SL of 15% of cost. But in FNO 0.75 to 1.50% Depend on volatility of stocks. For Day I usually use 15 max time in fno. So may b that's reason I'm not able to judge proper SL.
Thank you sir for your guidance...

251 2018-05-06 19:13:32 Yes ATR is one way to do it provided u don't mind far away SL. On dya trading , the Diif of H/L on an average varies in Cash stocks with Margins. Like 0.25% Margin has ATR ( on ATR=1 call it DTR) 1.68-2.22% on a non-event day.

256 2018-05-06 19:11:27 I have legit Q's  about the #Trading education space. If these guys are giving trade signals in the chat room to others or selling a dream their FT traders for $$$ courses w/ no track record, how is this not securities violations w/o a S65 or S7/S66 to do so? #iNVESTING #stocks
257 2018-05-06 19:10:13 @VP is so full of BS. This tax scam is going to be the ruination of our country. When the full effects of what the GOP has done, stocks will drop, wages will drop, jobs will drop, healthcare will inflate, people will be left destitute, lose their homes & worse many will die.
258 2018-05-06 19:10:03 They have the stocks in Volga, so in June the exports should remain supported! But at what price, that's the question?
259 2018-05-06 19:09:29 Our Tax Scam has allowed large corporations to buy back billions 
in stocks as it dropped crumbs to the poor and middle class.
Businesses of all sizes have yet to pass on the savings to its workers.
260 2018-05-06 19:08:47 A poem should be high-res and eroded

Of legible sarcasms where the bedtime has injured--

A poem should be misshapen
As the comer of redundancies.
261 2018-05-06 19:07:51 Do hunters use bump stocks nowadays?

What a stupid quote.

#2A
262 2018-05-06 19:06:23 To clarify further: No US pension, just SS vested a long time ago. And US stocks *because* complied w/PFIC.(1) If #TTFI qualified, no need to show "foreign" income, just check box and list US income & get refund for SS re treaty? (2) No more #PFIC and #FBAR or still there?
263 2018-05-06 19:06:13 I agree with that as well.  I have dip bought almost every day for the last 2 weeks $FUSZ #Stocks #TechNews
264 2018-05-06 19:02:44 Didn't spot any today, will look closer next time. Potting on two agaves wiped out my stocks
265 2018-05-06 19:01:41 Based on this headline I better sell all my stocks and runs for the hill. Imminent $TSLAQ AKA #bankwupcy. Run, run run....
266 2018-05-06 19:00:41 Let me put this another way: If US-Israel tax treaty says I should pay no tax on SS, can I at least opt to be TTFI qualified but show return with "US" income - i.e., SS and US stocks (due to PFIC) & get a refund on the 30% withholding?
267 2018-05-06 19:00:33 Losing stocks most other characters wouldn't, have a MU that is in your favor (rosa for example) get a single sequence and kill off it, or the entirety of the limit mechanic. Throwing him in a situation where limit is there puts him in a situation of having B moves off limit. 2o?
268 2018-05-06 19:00:19 No sir you are wrong! Majority of people don’t want to take away all guns! Just the bump stocks and ability to mow down multiple people in a couple minutes! You are the one being lied to or lying!
269 2018-05-06 18:59:43 I would agree.  They have now hired an outside source to work that.  Time to focus on growing the business even more. $FUSZ #stockstowatch #STOCKS #bigpayback
270 2018-05-06 18:59:30 They are more than willing. Limit magazines to small numbers of ammo. Better background checks. Eliminate bump stocks. Limit access to mental health patients and domestic violence criminals. Not more guns.

275 2018-05-06 18:57:29 Te problem with a centralized ledger is that it’s very difficult and expensive to maintain and causes lots of delays because the parties (such as brokers) don’t trust each other.

This is why it takes 10+ days to move stocks between brokers.

Civilian rifles tend to miss out on one or more of those.

It's why mass shooters choose the AR-15.

301 2018-05-06 18:25:42 So Trump never used an executive order to ban bump stocks or take ANY other gun actions this yr? & Congress only 1) threw money at gun-violence studies & 2) threw money at updating the Criminal Database (which I hope is always being updated)? #midterms2018 #gunsensenow #failme

307 2018-05-06 18:18:49 Comprehensive, universal background checks including private sales. The current background check may be correct, but it's application is inconsistent. I also support banning bump stocks and other devices that make guns work more like automatics. Also limit magazine/clip capacity.

310 2018-05-06 18:15:58 Since 1982 they've been artificially padding performance by buying shares of their own stocks.  How about some regulations?????
311 2018-05-06 18:15:57 The NRA is not opposing a ban on bump stocks. As far as magazines go, I hear you. Large capacity magazines, in the hands of a killer, intensify lethality. On the other hand, if crimals have them, and frankly, government agents, then I think citizens should have them too.
312 2018-05-06 18:15:47 Buy them stocks boost that portfolio

320 2018-05-06 18:08:26 The AR style weapons have become a target because they've become the go to gun of mass shooters. I understand that most people don't use them that way and I'm straddling the fence on banning them. I am in favor of banning bump stocks and limiting magazine/clip capacities.
321 2018-05-06 18:06:12 Ya Tonya.  We’ve been “had”.  Unemployment lowest in decades, stocks up and 401ks way up, North Korea and South Korea approaching peace, but libs so blinded by their own hatred will never admit it and would rather the country fail. Hypocrits

324 2018-05-06 18:02:02 So he buys everyone a home.
Then what? 
200k wouldn't buy much and it still wouldn't put food on the homeless plate ( or get them plates) stocks price drop would stall job creation & it would drastically alter property values in those areas where people invest in property.
So no

375 2018-05-06 17:06:56 Skewness is a different thing and cannot be captured by IV/IVP/IVR

Regarding capturing IVP of OTM options, this becomes an issue with illiquid stocks.

IVR/IVP may not be perfect but can still be used general option trading.

377 2018-05-06 17:06:02 @Buddercups where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
378 2018-05-06 17:05:13 Thus the most popular MoMo stocks of the 1960s crashed 80%; similar to 1929-30 crash. The crash was made worse because the public had fully bought into these names.
In 1929 there were only 4 Mln Americans who owned stocks. But by the 1970 peak, that number had swelled to 31 Mln.
379 2018-05-06 17:05:10 His numbers went up I got tax cut just retired stocks and bonds good just keep on Hayton   Nother four years coming up you can hate longer

381 2018-05-06 17:03:19 We're investors n here to make $ so who gives a shit which coin is better? or which coin wins the civil war? If u were in stocks would u give a shit if apple or samsung is better? who cares as long as ur $ is in the right one when it goes up. I would not waste 1 sec on the issue.

383 2018-05-06 17:01:49 .@WarrenBuffett said unlike real estate or company stocks, virtual currencies have no real value and only attract charlatans.  

Hey Warren, check out Carl Menger and subjective theory of value. It solved this thing called the water-diamond paradox & fully negates your argument.

385 2018-05-06 17:00:28 Fx is probably one of the few markets that isn’t like this (in most cases). 

Oil, bonds, stocks, broader commodities all look like the above. I.e wider osclinations from extreme to extreme

393 2018-05-06 16:53:40 Regardless, I believe that the US needs strong gun control. It is insane that children can acquire high powered rifles, that bump stocks exist, that we don’t have limitations on number of firearms and magazine sizes, that guns can be sold privately without background checks...etc

397 2018-05-06 16:50:05 Control and reform are not the same. Control suggests micromanaging. The reform that is being discussed is primarily improving background checks to keep guns out of the hands of irresponsible/unstable people, banning bump stocks, limiting magazine/clip capacity. Not the same!
398 2018-05-06 16:49:59 No military grade firearms.
Ban bump stocks.
Universal licensing.
Liability insurance.
Firearm registration.
Longer waiting periods.
Longer cooldown periods.
Buyback programs.
Set period amnesty on banned firearms.
Mandatory background checks.

Just off the top of my head.
399 2018-05-06 16:49:33 My feelings: 

1. Universal Background Checks, with no loopholes.
Tens of thousands of criminals & other dangerous people have been stopped from buying guns already

2. Ban AR-15 type guns

3. Limit Magazine capacity & Bump Stocks
Many lives are saved because people had to reload

402 2018-05-06 16:48:19 Stocks have nothing to do with Trump. NK/SK Korea happened without Trump. Unemployment is thanks to Obama (more jobs created in Obama's last year than in Trump's first year, FYI.)
403 2018-05-06 16:47:45 PS: 99% of stocks that you own AREN’T actually backed by ANYTHING, & AREN’T representative of company ownership. #Blockchain #Bitcoin #StockMarket #WallStreet #PonziScheme #PetroYuan #Inflation
404 2018-05-06 16:47:00 I think the fine young citizens of Chicago are using full semi-automatic ghost guns, equipped with bump stocks, binary triggers, and high capacity magazine clips, that they purchased legally, without background checks.
405 2018-05-06 16:45:29 They did a study and if you strip out Buffett’s top 5 best performing stocks during the periods in which he owned them he would generate an average annualized return of around 6%. Now this figure excludes leverage, if you add leverage at virtually a 0% borrowing rate well that...

413 2018-05-06 16:41:00 I tweeted it! I actually found some bottles at a local store that only occasionally stocks them yesterday. Hoping I can get someone to bring some 12 packs to Dayton though.
414 2018-05-06 16:40:51 How are you coming on banning bump stocks ?
415 2018-05-06 16:40:24 It varies from m2m, but i usually trade momo stocks and hold investments.
Research is always the key. The momentum traders are normally garbage that you can flip quickly from 20 - 60% gains daily.
416 2018-05-06 16:39:55 #WarrenBuffett is the only person I know that makes me feel like investing in stocks and/or productive assets is NOT as scary as it may seem. “You can’t really fail at it unless you buy the wrong stocks or just get excited at the wrong time.”
417 2018-05-06 16:39:21 @GOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SenateGOP @POTUS Still no ban on bump stocks after Vegas. Still no extended bckgrnd checks & assault rifles after school shootings. Our government officials r not protecting Americans, they r protecting their pockets. #NRABloodMoney
418 2018-05-06 16:39:13 But only if you startet 10 Years ago with Bitcoin. Now it is too late and the same hard work like Stocks and the rest.
419 2018-05-06 16:37:36 I’ve gotten some vital intel that #GavsieIndustries is in the Red. Stocks are falling rapidly and these big corporations are pulling out of the partnership agreements.

431 2018-05-06 16:22:36 His endorsement helped lift Apple (AAPL) stock to an all-time closing high. It climbed almost 4%.

Buffett was relatively late to investing in Apple and tech stocks overall.

He didn't report his first purchase of Apple shares until two years ago,

448 2018-05-06 16:00:00 @NRA You guys need to check on Steve Sisolak out here in Las Vegas.  Running for Gov. in Nevada.  Claims he has an A- rating with the NRA, but is now claiming he wants to ban bump stocks, ar-15's and suppressor/silencers.  Need to have him remove that rating.

456 2018-05-06 15:51:27 They will leap to the defense of bump stocks & AR-15s, but are silent as black men are shot by police in open carry states at the mere hint of being armed

Mostly bec they don't want to admit the cops fears are "justified" bec the market is unregulated & flooded w/ dangerous guns
457 2018-05-06 15:51:11 Looking at this from a Devil's Advocate position, what percentage of those same superannuation investments would be held in stocks related to the fossil fuels sectors?

459 2018-05-06 15:50:24 The capitalist mindset and corporate greed will kill humanity much faster than improve and progress it. Money is nothing. Stocks are nothing.

506 2018-05-06 15:08:26 In regards to Buffett, Im sure he is anything but inconsistent. 
And Munger holding a portfolio of only 4 stocks for the Daily Journal Corp kind of reiterates what they've already said aswell
507 2018-05-06 15:07:46 #Dubai Statistics Center announced that foreign investment stocks in Dubai reached Dh505 billion in 2016, an increase of 25.3% from 2015.
508 2018-05-06 15:06:32 Nope, lie. 4th gen. Texan & learned hunting from grandad & dad. The2nd amend., sensible gun solutions. Ban bump stocks, limit clips10 shells, national background checks for abusers, mentally deficient, felons, no fly-no guns. gun safety training shotguns, rifles & handguns
509 2018-05-06 15:06:28 #StockBondCorrelation is a market indicator for excess capacity; with the economy at potential, growth surprises lead to the @federalreserve raising real rates (but not to increased earnings expectations), hurting stocks and bonds together through discounting: think P/E=1/(r-g)
510 2018-05-06 15:06:11 War no longer an abomination-a venture to promote global finance-blue chip stocks tied to gun companies will soar as greed degrade humanity
511 2018-05-06 15:04:16 I agree ! The only other stocks with similar rev projections are $WB and $TCEHY . Market ignoring fact Tencent gets piece of Fortnight
512 2018-05-06 15:04:08 the electric landscape has become so diff from the past few yrs. BMW, Audi, Nissan, Lucid etc, i would rather buy their stocks than TSLA

514 2018-05-06 15:00:31 Isn't that what dollar cost averaging is?  TBH, you shouldn't do DCA with individual stocks. But it can make sense with low-cost index funds
515 2018-05-06 14:59:23 Of course small towns are coming back:  peace breaking out all over the world, ISIS gone, stocks up by $7 trillion, Kanye supporting Trump, welfare down, $1.5 trillion tax cut, Black unemployment lowest level ever, 450,000 new manufacturing jobs...
Love it.
516 2018-05-06 14:58:23 nah it was a sheik and I was playing falcon, and then I got fucking gimped twice on both stocks
517 2018-05-06 14:58:09 McCain should ask Trump to give his eulogy:  Do you love peace breaking out all over the world, ISIS gone, stocks up by $7 trillion, Kanye supporting Trump, welfare down, $1.5 trillion tax cut, Black unemployment lowest level ever, 450,000 new manufacturing jobs...?  Love it?
518 2018-05-06 14:55:56 The one that took 17 lives in less than 9 minutes. The type used in Las Vegas. The one used in Orlando. The AR15 and any use of bump stocks.
519 2018-05-06 14:55:49 Seeing how Berkshire Hathaway has a major invested interest in the amount of tens of billions in bank stocks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo, which are 25% of their portfolio. Bitcoin and crypto would make his life’s work suffer tremendous losses.
520 2018-05-06 14:54:55 These numbers look unreasonably high, especially if these numbers don't account for RSU and bonuses. Even a senior makes >= 25% in stocks and bonuses.

523 2018-05-06 14:50:44 Guys on my TL - name 2 stocks that you would recommend buying tomorrow - one for the May series, and one for the year!!

My 2 stocks: Bata for May, National Aluminium for the year!
524 2018-05-06 14:50:41 I agree, but for the average investor, picking an index is easier than picking individual stocks, and the accumulated time required to stay current with your strategy (and accept the increased volatility) also represents a significant investment.

532 2018-05-06 14:42:31 Simple! The economic works when money flows through the economy. Cash transfers through stuff like stocks and loans don't effect economic growth. Rather sale of products do cause economic growth like GDP. If I gave you $1, you'd spend it. $1m, you'd save it.

534 2018-05-06 14:40:50 You know how much more you would spend owning than renting long term? More than twice as much to get a marginal return. You can invest that money in stocks and get a way higher return. There's nothing wrong with either it's a preference thing.

539 2018-05-06 14:35:39 Funny, dont here trump bragging about stock market and jobs anymore. Wages not up, but corp reinvesting and buying their own stocks.  Doesnt help middle america. No one really thought the tax cut(corporate tax cuts) would. Trump bought and paid for by Koch brothers
540 2018-05-06 14:34:49 IFGs probably the best place to discuss these points.Some fishermen are concerned abt divers cleaning stocks out/moving them as this brings issues, just as you feel mobile scallop fishing brings its own problems.Truth is both bring issues, both bring positives.

544 2018-05-06 14:31:43 It is inconsistent. If one has lots of cash or real estate or some other assets of course he can be concentrated in one part of his portfolio- listed stocks. But dont try that with total portfolio

563 2018-05-06 14:16:28 I’ve heard this same old political bs from the NRA for over 50 yrs @DLoesch! Nobody’s looking to take our guns away!! What we need is stronger background checks, ban bump stocks & certified training for anybody who wants to own a military assault rifle!!
564 2018-05-06 14:15:10 Trump had $79M in cash to buy a property, but didn't have enough money to give the promised $100M to the RNC (he sold stocks to give $60M) nor to pay Cohen. What a hypocrite to imply Hillary was crooked!

571 2018-05-06 14:03:20 I’m not for repeal either, Blake. I’m for registration and a national database, mandated safety training, banning of modifiers like bump stocks and silencers, and restrictions on clips and semi-autos. 
Note that guns would still be legal and we have similar laws about vehicles.

634 2018-05-06 12:48:06 I do agree it's Icky but icky dont mean illegal. Do you think this outweighs all the successful things Trump has accomplished like NK denuke, record high stocks, record low unemployment,  Isis crushed, more American jobs among others?
635 2018-05-06 12:46:20 Why would you want @WarrenBuffetHQ to invest in Tesla or any of your other ventures? His investment philosophy is so very different. If Berkshire Hathaway buys TSLA stocks I never would have invested any of my money in it !!

638 2018-05-06 12:42:28 The problem with 2nd Amendment is if there was ever a government take over, how many of the people buying bump stocks and semi automatic weapons, do we want them taking up their guns to fight them and would they know enough issues to know which side to be on??

673 2018-05-06 11:54:00 For stocks, Stan Weinstein considered pullbacks on contracting volume "healthy". For example, once a Stage 2 breakout is established, any pullback on non-contracting volume is a warning sign. Compounded with other warning signs: 30 week MA violations & trendlines breaks. Patrick

686 2018-05-06 11:31:36 Barron’s cover last week was value stocks.  This week’s issue has a defensive undertone through several articles from utes, to dividend aristocrat yields and an article on high yield preferred stock.  Late when media covers a theme.  Often contrary outcome.  We’ll see.
687 2018-05-06 11:31:14 No - he doesn’t. Most of his stocks are long term investments and he looks for dividend not short term investment. If he doesn’t believe in a company anymore he sells - no matter at loss or win and if he believes in a company he hodls.

689 2018-05-06 11:29:44 The article doesn’t say a word about 2A.  It’s about banning the guns that are used in those mass killings. Whether bump stocks or other, no hunter needs a gun that sprays that much that quickly. No one is coming after 2A or your pistols or rifles.

692 2018-05-06 11:23:53 I know the difference as I’m a hunter and gun owner. Be honest at least, a standard hunting rifle is not capable of holding a 30 plus shot clip. The design itself is meant for rapid fire. Background checks, bump stocks, waiting periods and private sales background cks are a must
693 2018-05-06 11:22:42 what happens to the share price of a preferred stock when interest rates rise? THE PRICE GETS KILLED. NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME TO BUY PREFERRED STOCKS UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR PRINCIPLE TO GET KILLED.

736 2018-05-06 10:18:20 94% of Americans support background checks for buying a gun. 82% want to raise the legal age to buy a gun from 18 to 21. 81% want to ban bump stocks, 73% want to ban high capacity magazines and 72% want to ban assault style weapons.

767 2018-05-06 09:32:33 We are in a delicate situation. The market's acting weak and looks as if it topped while QE remains a force to be reckoned with. The reaction rallies up into the 50d reveal this tug-of-war between a sagging market and the unmovable central banks. Bull trap wonderland! #stocks

823 2018-05-06 08:20:19 Honestly it's a shame that because the S4 meta started out with really slow gameplay and campy top tiers like Sonic/Ness/Rosa that we were forced into using 2 stock, because with the current meta trending more and more towards chars that can kill you at 0, 2 stocks isn't enough.

890 2018-05-06 06:03:12 And you should, because I doubt shorting stocks is worthwhile on average.  Even worse when people spread lies to try advantage their position.  Only thing worth shorting is put options, which means a double negative, thus going long.

897 2018-05-06 05:47:35 Stocks are for the 1% - anyone else is fooling themselves that they will be a billionaire in this lifetime.
898 2018-05-06 05:44:59 And it all comes down to what the people making the decisions think is reasonable. One politician might think Banning bump stocks is enough. Another politician might think gun confiscation is reasonable.

902 2018-05-06 05:37:48 What I like so much is that the NRA is so organized and how fast things got done when it came to bump stocks. Look carefully this is a big reveal on how the NRA operates, participates on gun control. Who gave them permission and when do they decide?

931 2018-05-06 04:45:52 Why ban AR’s?? Are you also going to ban handguns, 22 rifles and other hunting rifles? AR’s don’t shoot any faster or more than those guns I listed. I’m for common sense regulations (bump stocks, background checks and cut loopholes) but at least know the difference

935 2018-05-06 04:38:07 Bump stocks is mostly a way to waste ammunition AND ISN'T EVEN NECESSARY TO PERFORM 'BUMP FIRE.  Kinda pointless to outlaw that.    How about passing laws that come down harder on the criminal use of these weapons instead of trying to turn the lawful into criminals?
936 2018-05-06 04:32:17 YEP! In the history of America unemployment is the lowest it's ever been for Black & Hispanic, It's also the lowest in 50 years.  Most tax cuts in the history of America, stocks are the highest in decades, Americans first! Not Criminal aliens! MS13 being hunted down.  GOD is back

941 2018-05-06 04:22:21 The problem is that the markets aren't efficient and great investors/traders have proven that over and over again. At the end of the day 10-15 stocks (of course, that aren't correlated) if you hold quality companies - will definitely appreciate your money better than the market.

945 2018-05-06 04:10:38 The reason why the gold prices keep on rising is due to perception that gold is a safe-haven asset. Majority of ETF inflows were into US gold-back ETFs to hedge against volatility. People can also get exposure to gold in gold futures, derivatives, options & stocks.
946 2018-05-06 04:10:04 Bruh apple stocks looking good right now  
947 2018-05-06 04:09:59 YOU said you would protect the 2nd amendment BUT all you've done is ban things that contain to guns like bump stocks. STEP BACK from that stance. It will hurt you in. Ask your sons. They KNOW bump stocks do NOT turn semi's into full auto. That's the only thing I disagree with you
948 2018-05-06 04:08:43 What if we have a deflationary sell-off and gold and stocks both go down together? With rates rising, I personally think leverage (explicitly or implicit) is dangerous.
949 2018-05-06 04:08:32 Except bump stocks. And age limits.
950 2018-05-06 04:01:55 What freaking accomplishment giant tax break for the wealthy and buisness...those incentives are not being invested in America as Trump said but being used to buy stocks and other businesses a increase in fuel and gas prices have eaten away any tax break the working class have
951 2018-05-06 03:56:58 Absolutely Gutted. With Vincent gone too, the open class pacing stocks suddenly looks void of major top talent. Although, with Monbet returning, the trotting depth & quality has really become quite good & interesting

957 2018-05-06 03:40:45 MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Liberal Democrats hate the fact that America is rising to her feet.

966 2018-05-06 03:29:32 I simply repeat: growth + dividends = superior investment return. Either one or none of the two won't work as well, or only short term. Print in your psyche, and act accordingly #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
967 2018-05-06 03:28:33 No I mean in twitter as a whole not your profile on particular. I don’t keep up with stocks much, just crypto. People just mad that people are overvaluing Tesla despite its relatively poor business?
968 2018-05-06 03:28:19 basically the assumption is, trade happens in cash segment for FNO stocks. so we simply exit as per system not as per exclusion, and the stocks from FNO watch list gets added/removed based on exclusion/inclusion list that NSE updates every month. cutt off-7%

971 2018-05-06 03:24:29 On the right, they repeat this mantra to keep you in hatred.
But no one is trying to take your guns away. Limiting bump stocks is it. That is nowhere near taking guns away. Trump even said he'd eliminate bump stocks.
No one is trying to take your guns away.

975 2018-05-06 03:19:47 I don't have an opinions here. Definitely something about cultural aspect that we do not know about.  In Janus factor book I have read that Japanese stocks where like FD until the time American came and changed the dynamics of market.

977 2018-05-06 03:18:16 It’s a nonsense remark that sounds more fitting for a Facebook meme with a minion.
Even cowboy hat later admits his value is in stocks and he can’t just cash-out that value as such, or at the same value.

Bezos likely can’t buy all homeless homes even if he tried
978 2018-05-06 03:18:03 I see a lot of things now that I didn’t used to see and I’m thankful God opened my eyes to them.
979 2018-05-06 03:16:20 Idiots, when will they learn.  Almost wants me to get back into stocks, too easy.
980 2018-05-06 03:12:33 You do know that Net Worth is not the same thing as liquid assets right?  It includes things like bonds, stocks, retirement accounts, etc. which are not things that can always be cashed this instant.
981 2018-05-06 03:12:33 S&P was up 47% during this time of @BarackObama's presidency, stocks are only up 17% since Trump was elected. Since Jan 26, S&P and Dow stopped hitting new high, they are still down around 8% since that time. You're living in fantasy land! Isolationist Trump will ruin the economy
982 2018-05-06 03:12:28 I am not a Trump whore. Rising stocks do not pay me to ignore his criminality.
983 2018-05-06 03:09:38 The stock market is way up since November 2016.  I guess u don’t own own or follow stocks.  Facts show that country is doing much better now.  Democrats, obviously to me, trying to ruin our country.
984 2018-05-06 03:09:22 Yes it is

1006 2018-05-06 02:44:31 Well Donnie, we ARE voting out those who are putting their own agenda before Americans. As for gun control.... AR-15s and bump stocks are NOT protected by the 2A, so, we aren't attacking those rights. #sitdown

1022 2018-05-06 02:22:30 Where is that law banning bump stocks? Have you seen how that has been wrapped up in red tape? If the NRAreally wanted them gone it would have happened by December. There has to be a will for there to be a way. You just have to elect people with the will.
1023 2018-05-06 02:21:35 He obviously meant “rate of fire.” Even though that doesn’t apply, unless he means bump stocks.

1027 2018-05-06 02:16:51 Pretty sure I'm opening a can of worms here but, hey @JoelHeyman is it possible to owe money if you invest in stocks and they drop in value enough? Is there a situation where this is possible? I'm not currently an investor but am curious about it.
1028 2018-05-06 02:14:58 Random thoughts: if I could buy into marijuana stocks in the US, I would. Industry's booming.
1029 2018-05-06 02:12:29 Majority is CNN stocks are owned by Saudi Arabia.
Remaining stocks are owned by the anti-American marxists.

CNN we don't need you.
We still remember 911.

1045 2018-05-06 01:55:54 Maybe all their stocks were that specific toy...

idk though lol
1046 2018-05-06 01:55:46 I gave much respect and affection for you, Charles. You are a truly good man, and very perceptive on stocks.
1047 2018-05-06 01:52:45 What do we need bump stocks for? I know what they do...take a semi automatic weapon and turn it into an automatic weapon.
1048 2018-05-06 01:49:48 If there's anything I want from next Smash game, it's 3 stocks, minimum.
1049 2018-05-06 01:48:10 How many models / creatives actually make money, save their money?

What i mean by savings is how many actually have money market accounts, high yield cds, stocks and passive streams of incomes set up. 

I’m thinking of doing a Facebook live on this topic.
1050 2018-05-06 01:47:55 Feels like I'm watching sm4sh with 4 stocks~

Aaaaaaaaaa
1051 2018-05-06 01:46:45 We need to ban assault style weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, suppressors, unauthorized online sale of ammo. Improve background checks, few weeks wait time for gun buys. If a gun other than stolen is used in killings, accidental firing, prosecute owner as well. 1)
1052 2018-05-06 01:45:55 Trump is so broke that he has been shorting stocks and then publicly attacking companies to drive the price down.  #pettytweets #trumpissobroke
1053 2018-05-06 01:42:15 Is it just me or does the term AI seem like an overused buzz word? I always thought of AI as Lt. Comander Data making me an omelette. Sadly that is precisely how I'd use my own personal Commander Data, to make me an omelette then pick penny stocks and cryptos.
1054 2018-05-06 01:41:50 $MYO trade idea over 4.30 for me, for a potential move to 5+.

1055 2018-05-06 01:41:11 Great video!
1056 2018-05-06 01:40:42 A lotta money to be made in war. Wanna short some weapons stocks? No! Ammo they (guess who?) got to make enough bullets for all these simultaneous forever-wars.
1057 2018-05-06 01:40:12 More similar than what? The AR 15 is a semi automatic rifle. It is similar to and sometimes identical in use to other hunting rifles that have traditional wooden stocks. Should we just outlaw all rifles then?
1058 2018-05-06 01:39:34 Congrats on the KDerby trifecta tonight lol. Lucky... If anyone wants to follow someone who actually knows Bio stocks check my main bio guy at @optionsboul. Only person I listen to when it comes to bio. Can't even say how many times this dude has been right on Bio/run ups to news
1059 2018-05-06 01:38:49 This sounds crazy but totally something Republicans would say..but if we brought back public square hangings or medieval stocks for elected officials who broke the law then LIED about it. I bet not so many would strive to become elected, keep their office, and do what they want
1060 2018-05-06 01:37:50 The Pure Stocks Feature is coming up next at @SalinaHighbank1. #WoOCraftSCS #WoO40th
1061 2018-05-06 01:36:38 Open Competition Pure Stocks, Strictly Stock, Mini Stocks we are running at Bronson Speedway. Come and have some fun on the high banks.
1062 2018-05-06 01:34:53 Nah the barrier of entry isn't any lower IMO.  Tons of brokers allow you to buy penny stocks like you can in crypto...what's better in equities is that you can actually short those PnDs, whereas in crypto you cannot.  Only being able to trade one side is a HUGE turnoff for me
1063 2018-05-06 01:34:07 Bro they have already covered their shorts and preparing for tactics for round 2,
1064 2018-05-06 01:28:07 And if we are to compare shitcoins to stocks, wheres an exchange you can buy $1 worth of a stock like you can with a crypto?

So you agree barrier is lower in crypto? 
1065 2018-05-06 01:28:07 2 stocks is stupid and boring
1066 2018-05-06 01:27:26 Stocks will trade in f&o as usual..But there would not be auto settlement..If one do not square off his trade than it will settled as compulsory delivery
1067 2018-05-06 01:26:41 idc about stocks. why should i have to write about them?!
1068 2018-05-06 01:23:30 Yet #Stocks crushing it, yet African American Unemployment LOWEST in HISTORY, yet Hispanics Unemployment best levels in 20 yrs, yet Corps in #RustBelt & #MidWest offering $25k recruitment bonuses to new hires because there is about 8K shortage of skilled workers. #Winning #POTUS

Ty Gibbs leading large over Layne Riggs after three laps.
1073 2018-05-06 01:16:12 Adam Plazek, 6 cylinders; Alex Riley, Mini Stocks; and Josh Sliter, Mod Lites: take checkered flag on @Merrittville 67th season opener.
1074 2018-05-06 01:15:29 My brother losing money on those Tesla stocks, pick it the fuck up
1075 2018-05-06 01:13:06 Great game today. I thought I was losing, but managed to shift some stocks around, open two companies right after the 5s broke, and push the train rush hard enough to bankrupt another player. I squeaked out a win by $45 over the third player.
1076 2018-05-06 01:12:24 We need to ban: automatic assault rifles, large number ammunition cartridges and bump stocks. We need stringent background check requirement for all gun sales (remove loopholes). We need to allow gun violence research to base additional changes to combat gun violence on FACTS.
1077 2018-05-06 01:11:01 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS the best thing to happen to the stock market since options trading started in Chicago, and Rosevelt  #MAGA #stocks #StockMarket #money #FDR #Nasdaq #Dow
1078 2018-05-06 01:09:54 They seem to all be thieves an corrupt.  If someone better doesn’t run. Yes I will.  Since he has become president wages up, unemployment down major advances in many areas.  My stocks up.  Been good for me
1079 2018-05-06 01:08:39 Seems like it. I am sure it's hard when you already believe the worst in what in reality is one of our best presidents.

Just run the important numbers, jobs, taxes, stocks, ISIS, NK. All the while advocating to end the ridiculous illegal immigration most Pols won't touch.
1080 2018-05-06 01:08:39 Trump needs to Shut up and be a true 2A supporter. Ban on bump stocks is outrageous and clearly not pro 2A!
1081 2018-05-06 01:06:50 Pure Stocks Heat Races are coming up next at @SalinaHighbank1. #WoOCraftSCS #WoO40th
1082 2018-05-06 01:04:58 They're just salty that people are leaving or just not interested in traditional "stocks and bonds" anymore.  To me this is a good sign.
1083 2018-05-06 01:03:48 So many lies! Did anyone expect anything other from the ultimate con man /criminal @realDonaldTrump always has been, always will! Need to get this ass out of the highest office in our land. Embarrassing and unethical and we truly are the laughing stocks of the world
1084 2018-05-06 01:01:33 Invest in oil & defence stocks -- immediately.
1085 2018-05-06 00:57:01 Why are you people so scared of common sense gun laws? Why do you need assault rifles? Why does comprehensive background checks scare you? Why does not selling bump stocks and high capacity magazines bother you?  We don’t want your guns. But we do want children to stop dying!
1086 2018-05-06 00:55:12 The best thing I have right now is the fact I invest 5% of my paycheck in the stocks of my job. Saving without thinking about it 
1087 2018-05-06 00:54:32 Thanks to my MP @ardwell_i for teaching me about trading stocks, now I’ve made my first purchase on the stock market thanks to his guidance and help with getting me started! Invest your money, let it work for you! Long term wealth is the KEY!
1088 2018-05-06 00:53:45 "win neutral lose stocks"
THE BIGGEST FUCKING MOOD
1089 2018-05-06 00:52:40 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
1090 2018-05-06 00:51:55 And so should politicians who do not support sensible gun legislation!!! Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Institute better mental health and background checks!  Americans should be safe in school, church, discos, and concerts!!  Ensure the safety of our young people!  Lead!
1091 2018-05-06 00:51:29 That’s a lie @realDonaldTrump. We’re not aiming to disarm, but we want common sense gun laws. No assault rifles, no high capacity magazines and no bump stocks. Any one with us?  This president lies with such regularity and ease, it’s scary. #onetermtrump #BlueUpTexas
1092 2018-05-06 00:50:16 every mid level falco is going to start spamming Up - B against peach at high %s. enjoy the free stocks peach players :p
1093 2018-05-06 00:50:14 Come on he is selling stocks not cars.
1094 2018-05-06 00:49:53 It's fair because idk, maybe you weren't feeling 3 stocks at the time/weren't sure if it was gonna count towards pgr/thought it would've been boring for viewers.

But we had Gnes on the mic and the commentary was A1
1095 2018-05-06 00:49:50 oh and if they have the same amount of stocks. Its basically then functions as a way of shortening the matches which is definitely in mango's favor
1096 2018-05-06 00:48:53 yay amazon stocks :D
1097 2018-05-06 00:48:35 If both players are at highish percent and have 2 or 3 stocks, and in the right situation with respect to the stage (where mango dies quickly and can get to hbox for the post rest punish) its actually great for preventing camping from hbox
1098 2018-05-06 00:46:57 Nice little battle between Boyd and Wilson for second – Wilson ended up coming out on top but no had anything for Paul Lubno - he takes the checkered flag for the Pepsi Grand Stocks. Wilson, Boyd, Pasderetz, Blasingame.
1099 2018-05-06 00:46:21 I support the US #2A even as a UK Citizen as bans only benefit the criminals and give the Government the monopoly on violence yet the statement on the pulling of the trigger until bump stocks are banned and other such modifications is slightly erroneous.
1100 2018-05-06 00:46:20 It's the consensus idea among people who understand stocks, but that's counterbalanced for now by the size and strength of the Tesla cult.
1101 2018-05-06 00:45:22 EE doesnt like commentating 3 stocks, yall annoying now
1102 2018-05-06 00:43:55 That's why I was so offended by banning bump stocks. Just another avenue to exeed authority on such a usles peiece of equiptment to begin with. It was not used in any recent events. Mr. President I sometimes think steering wheels will be next. The operators kill thousands a year.
1103 2018-05-06 00:42:57 I thought Mendelssohn would show better. I put a couple bucks on Firenze Fire at 70 to 1 odds. No money in picking the favorites...unless we're talking stocks. In that area I have a couple long term favs.
1104 2018-05-06 00:40:09 You said you would work on banning bump stocks & that the Republicans around you wouldn’t do the same because they’re afraid of the NRA. I don’t know what they told you when they came to meet with you after you made that statement but, apparently you are scared of them too! LIAR!
1105 2018-05-06 00:38:40 Warm Ups for the 23 Pure Stocks have wrapped up. #WoOCraftSCS #WoO40th
1106 2018-05-06 00:37:26 Careful when boring near Fygars - their fire can go through a shallow wall of dirt.

Also, lure multiple Pookas into a vertical trench before dropping the rock on their heads - its worth more points.

Yeah, its a metaphor for stocks, too.

;)
1107 2018-05-06 00:35:37 It's not in Buffett's interest for people to pull their money out of the stocks that he's bought into and to run to crypto.
1108 2018-05-06 00:34:51 I promise you it’ll be more than a 3rd, his stock is the highest of any backup goalie, backup goalies with high stocks have gotten first round picks before, if it’s right package, and someone wants to overpay for a 3 month wonder, pull the trigger
1109 2018-05-06 00:34:36 For tonight’s “Law Enforcement Night” there are 21 360 sprint cars, 13 pure stocks, 13 limited Late Models and 10 Midget lites.
1110 2018-05-06 00:34:18 Pure Stocks Warm Ups are coming up next at @SalinaHighbank1. #WoOCraftSCS
1111 2018-05-06 00:33:57 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
1112 2018-05-06 00:32:32 And again...that’s okay. It’s just off that you think you watching it supersedes Gase watching. 

Like me telling someone to sell Under Armour stocks because I watch it, when Warren Buffet says to buy it. Who’s opinion holds the weight?
1113 2018-05-06 00:31:59 One friend to another as we head out to a wedding: “you look like you sell penny stocks all day and do cocaine all night.”
1114 2018-05-06 00:30:34 We have a banking system with an army that fights on behalf of Wall Street. Did you see the stocks go down when Trump said we are pulling out of Syria?
1115 2018-05-06 00:29:58 I also think you don't know what a fuckboy is so stop trying to sound hip and go back to trading your stocks and whining about random people you don't know
1116 2018-05-06 00:27:29 No, that's "security", as in "securities and exchanges", as in, "stocks and bonds"
1117 2018-05-06 00:26:39 After meme-government and meme-stocks there’s meme-tech taking over. Mostly powered by bitcoin and this cult of Elon musk going around jumping up and down these days ...
1118 2018-05-06 00:25:08 Green Flag for the @pepsi Grand Stocks. So far Tim Wilson in control of this one. 5 of 40 laps complete.
1119 2018-05-06 00:24:55 It is, if you are playing or own Save The World, it’s currently haunting the stocks of the store on that too, so look out and not afraid!
1120 2018-05-06 00:18:26 I hate it when certain profiles for stocks and crypto go M.I.A. after the market hasn’t been doing well
1121 2018-05-06 00:17:40 Catch me and @tanner_stocks at the cards game tomorrow 
1122 2018-05-06 00:17:15 More money in my paycheck my  401k exploded and my loser brother actually got a job. Reality check #RedTsunami
1123 2018-05-06 00:15:44 The better player truly does win with three stocks
1124 2018-05-06 00:15:18 Sometimes properties are not the best investment. Not liquid enough just like stocks and bonds. How would you like to be your own bank? How would you like to get money when you want it instead of some stupid bank telling you no? There is an answer.
1125 2018-05-06 00:15:10 It should be noted that businesses that serve farmers -- tractor companies, seed companies, fertilizer companies -- are all taking a hit, too.  Check the market for some of those stocks.
1126 2018-05-06 00:14:26 Having a shaky start, taking more control and bringing it close g1 (often winning) over 3 stocks, then being confident g2 onward that you've got this.
We're 75% of the way to defeat with the same data vses 50% [bo5 helps but it's not the same).
1127 2018-05-06 00:12:26 I contribute the lower pay to the greed of corporations.  The #GOPTaxScam bill was for corporations, top 1%, and the big donors.  Trickle down never works.  Corporations are buying back stocks and not giving wage increases. We all knew that was going to happen
1128 2018-05-06 00:11:03 You say that Obama was terrible, but the stocks and job growth became better, but then turn around and say Trump did all of that. Believe whatever you want, but I will NEVER side with Trump until he can protect my communities. Even then, I doubt he would have my interests in mind
1129 2018-05-06 00:11:01 In #ROTY we did well to take advantage of weakness in the gene therapy space after $SLDB clinical hold- I suggest during current weakness in I/O space (due to $INCY IDO failure) to search for stocks poised to rebound where thesis is still intact. Several opportunities await...
1130 2018-05-06 00:05:48 As of right now 12 Sportsman Sprints, 31 modifieds, 14 Street stocks, 13 Outlaw tuners

-stocks/crypto(bitcoin,ether,litecoin) going up 
-beautiful day out 

How life should be
1132 2018-05-06 00:03:59 The notion that it creates jobs is laughable. Corporations buy back stocks and give out executive bonuses, hardly any of that goes to its labor force. Wages have not kept up with inflation and many people are overworked and underpaid.
1133 2018-05-06 00:03:06 Personally i like 3 stocks out of 2 stocks, higher outplay and clutch potential from players
1134 2018-05-06 00:00:15 #Headies2018 if it where in terms of Stock market analysis, Kaffy the dancer will have stocks/shares in every record lable or A-list music artist in Nigeria. She deserves the accolade.
1135 2018-05-05 23:59:49 Right. Jobs are up. Stocks are up. Korea settled down. Not sure what the dude defines as “failure”
1136 2018-05-05 23:59:34 Errmmm... Europe does not play with 3 stocks anymore... I'm sorry 
1137 2018-05-05 23:58:37 That’s why they tell you while they move the stocks up and down with a remote control. Don’t believe anything they tell you. We are living on an illusion.
1138 2018-05-05 23:58:21 What’s he done for you? Get a raise? Your stocks go up? Healthcare cost go down? Hahaha! He’s done nothing for u!
1139 2018-05-05 23:57:53 My Sub Div built 11 homes & it stopped few months of Obama election. Stayed same=Obama was in office. Since Feb 2017 Lot prices increased 51 homes have been built and only 2 lots left to build on. Economy is rocking my stocks are skyrocketing. Recession?
1140 2018-05-05 23:56:48 If you don’t have the stomach for it, your IQ won’t matter. Trading stocks is 80% head games and gut checks, and 20% smarts.
1141 2018-05-05 23:56:06 We'll also be building data aggregators (for news, reddit, analysis) into our platform. What tools do you use? We'd love to put them in!

1142 2018-05-05 23:54:26 I mean can't have you spend that money on something ridiculous like stocks or property when you could have a 1/5th size aegis 
1143 2018-05-05 23:52:18 Oil price may be factored in, but O&G company stocks are lagging way behind. There’s been too much noise for investors to notice.
1144 2018-05-05 23:50:32 GDP growth hasn’t hit the levels projected, Dow is down 3k YTD, unemployment isn’t a good stat when wage growth continues to be stagnant...I have stocks and I’m very close to bailing on them.
1145 2018-05-05 23:50:23 The water truck had a bit of a mishap while running the track in. Street Stocks are out packing the track now.
1146 2018-05-05 23:49:42 Why trade stocks though? Puff’s moves are so volatile against puff even with out the rest
1147 2018-05-05 23:47:07 More stocks allow players to prove their adaptation skills, I don't see why people don't like it.
1148 2018-05-05 23:46:18 Mike must have stocks in banks #insiders anyone who says no more regs, they love corrupt activity

1150 2018-05-05 23:45:55 Sorry but your history on Warren Buffett is incorrect. He bailed out some  banks when they were on the brink. They were not strong when he bought them. He bought USG he bailed out a weak company. Warren has bought troubled & weak companies. He invested mostly in necessity stocks
1151 2018-05-05 23:45:32 you realize had the South Florida police agencies entered in the shooter's information, he couldn't have bought the gun.  You can have all the background checks you want but if the info isn't entered in it won't help.  Bump stocks aren't available

1154 2018-05-05 23:59:49 Right. Jobs are up. Stocks are up. Korea settled down. Not sure what the dude defines as “failure”
1155 2018-05-05 23:59:34 Errmmm... Europe does not play with 3 stocks anymore... I'm sorry 
1156 2018-05-05 23:58:37 That’s why they tell you while they move the stocks up and down with a remote control. Don’t believe anything they tell you. We are living on an illusion.

1159 2018-05-05 23:56:48 If you don’t have the stomach for it, your IQ won’t matter. Trading stocks is 80% head games and gut checks, and 20% smarts.

1162 2018-05-05 23:52:18 Oil price may be factored in, but O&G company stocks are lagging way behind. There’s been too much noise for investors to notice.
1163 2018-05-05 23:50:32 GDP growth hasn’t hit the levels projected, Dow is down 3k YTD, unemployment isn’t a good stat when wage growth continues to be stagnant...I have stocks and I’m very close to bailing on them.

1169 2018-05-05 23:45:55 Sorry but your history on Warren Buffett is incorrect. He bailed out some  banks when they were on the brink. They were not strong when he bought them. He bought USG he bailed out a weak company. Warren has bought troubled & weak companies. He invested mostly in necessity stocks

1173 2018-05-05 23:38:41 It’s a good two cents. And home country bias isn’t a Canadian phenomenon. Tends to be the case around the world. The U.S. is about the only country where it’s somewhat justified though given the market cap of U.S. stocks relative global markets.

1180 2018-05-05 23:25:14 It doesn’t really taste like red bull, it has more of a strawberry taste I think. I tried it a few times, there’s a shop in Liverpool that stocks up on them, they’re great.

1184 2018-05-05 23:23:09 I believe in responsible gun control. Things that allow guns to be taken before a crime... Things that would have allowed the parklands shooter to be disarmed before shooting people.

I am also against bump stocks as they only. Exist to circumvent the law.

1185 2018-05-05 23:21:20 So if mr Vegas didn’t have legal access to multiple semiautomatic  weapons and bump stocks due to you lax gun controls and didn’t have multiple spare ammo rounds things wouldn’t be much better for over 400 innocents?hmm who needs education?

1189 2018-05-05 23:15:37 Because it looks scary and they’re psychopaths. It has the same function as a standard rifle of the same caliber yet they choose the black rifles over the traditional wood stocks. There is zero functional difference between a .223 AR 15 and a wooden stocked .223 rifle.
1190 2018-05-05 23:13:20 "he's living the stocks, squire"
1191 2018-05-05 23:10:06 Maybe you should liquidate some stocks.
1192 2018-05-05 23:09:14 Not that I know of.  Barrier to entry in crypto is keeping billions out.  If it were as simple as buying stocks, many more would do it.  I've tried to explain the steps to invest in alt coins to numerous family members.  All were interested til I went thru the hoops.  None bought
1193 2018-05-05 23:03:37 Yeah. I’d bet dthrow chain grabs to fair would just end stocks easily. But I doubt tornado would be that great in the matchup. Shuttle loop would just be devastating though
1194 2018-05-05 23:01:54 i was on the phone with my friend earlier and we spent 45 mins talking about stocks afkshsk the capitalist jumped out
1195 2018-05-05 23:01:46 Your stopping school violence act will mean nothing until you take military style guns, large capacity ammo and bump stocks off of our streets!  You’ve put billions of our dollars into the pockets of corporations, it is the least you could do.
1196 2018-05-05 23:00:40 These articles are so misleading. Seems someone is scared people might abandon stocks for gold and leave Buffett bagholding. 
Wonder why he didn't compare gold to USD over that period of time. Money vs Currency is a lot more accurate than putting gold against stocks.

1198 2018-05-05 22:58:08 While my Republican opponents fight over whether or not DACA recipients should have special licenses, we progressives are talking about issues that matter, like healthcare, getting Dreamers permanent legal status and banning bump stocks.
1199 2018-05-05 22:54:45 @GhostPanther that restaurant’s customers should be put in the stocks for 24 hours
1200 2018-05-05 22:49:13 Yes, you can modify it so it becomes like a fully automatic weapon. Do you not even remember bump stocks?
1201 2018-05-05 22:49:12 Didn't he approve the ban of bump stocks?
1202 2018-05-05 22:45:41 I dont make predictions. I view gold as insurance & an asset, not an investment that is expected to skyrocket or provide a return.The price of gold remaining relatively constant is a good thing.If you want to speculate - buy junior miners, cryptos, bio tech stocks or even silver.

1207 2018-05-05 22:41:56 Ross warrior is the best pumper in my opinion. Best of the best. Shitty trader but really really good pumper. Dek is number 2 for sure. Tim is not really pumper. Never seen him pumping stocks.
1208 2018-05-05 22:41:36 This is ridiculous & written so biasly. Like stocks & commodities, real estate prices can fluctuate,quite a lot. Why isn't Mueller looking into @SenWarren house flipping past, since we're now criminalizing investment savvy.
1209 2018-05-05 22:40:11 Dana saw the video must agree, but is anyone really surprised? As a proud member of the NRA one must ask.October 2nd the, MSM asked what was Paddock motive, we have to eliminate bump stocks. Never covered how did George Soros know shorting the MGM stock, would make 84 million.

1212 2018-05-05 22:35:37 Except for bump stocks...
1213 2018-05-05 22:35:36 Guess you must not have substantial investments in 401k & stocks/market to have financial adviser groups who work for you then

1215 2018-05-05 22:34:00 Protections like #NetNeutrality & banning bump stocks are supported by everyone but the gun-lobby, the Koch Brothers, and the Republican Party. Every time @CTGOP is given an opportunity to side with Americans, they choose Trump. #CTPolitics
1216 2018-05-05 22:33:51 I'm thinking with 11%+ exposure this makes a good short candidate too... especially if their taste in stocks is consistent.  A market hedge with a heavy concentration of $TSLA.
1217 2018-05-05 22:33:44 Publicly #WarrenBuffett says there are no called strikes in investing, but in private he complains bitterly about the stocks he missed. Being a serious investor is mostly self-criticism, unfortunately.
1218 2018-05-05 22:32:49 No one is trying to take away anyone’s guns!  It’s about banning assault rifles, bump stocks. It’s about tighter background checks. That’s all.
1219 2018-05-05 22:32:26 Best stock to own in both FANG and FANG+ is TSLA. 
TSLA can double but none of the FANG stocks can double in the near term, in next 1-2 years. But TSLA can double in next 1-2 years.

1221 2018-05-05 22:30:07 I totally get what you're saying. If he killed with a hammer, do we ban hammers? The bump stocks and automatic weapons that can kill more people in a very short amount of time is worrisome to me. I have children. I don't want to lose them.
1222 2018-05-05 22:30:04 Hello. @RwabukumbaC For you to say that companies are doing well, Please show us how stocks have been trending (daily, monthly, even yearly) if possible. Thnx
1223 2018-05-05 22:29:26 It would’ve been great to buy stocks in Google, Apple, Amazon, etc., when their prices were cheaper
1224 2018-05-05 22:28:49 I’m an ex-Gunners Mate in the Navy, retired as an E8 and I strongly support enacting common sense gun control laws. NO civilian needs an AK-47, bump stocks or large capacity mags. If you can’t take down an intruder with a hand gun, you have no business owning a gun.

1228 2018-05-05 22:24:50 oil backwardation pushes oil stockpilers to sell stocks now and buy futures contracts. normally this would push spot prices down.
1229 2018-05-05 22:22:56 Stocks fall after good earnings? If you believe markets are forward looking, the answer is pretty obvious. No need to go on and on about how wrong the market is. It's just doing its predictive work.
1230 2018-05-05 22:21:03 He obviously didn't hear the whole speech when Trump mentioned background checks and getting rid of bump stocks.
1231 2018-05-05 22:20:40 Maybe he can rope in the”judge”too. Stocks on bullet-proof shoes are up. Nothing good can come from this.

1243 2018-05-05 22:07:11 Why gold is a store of value is that it does not owe any Government debt, unlike stocks, which are dependent on fiat currencies. Gold produces wealth over time as fiat shown to be more destructive & reliant on debt.

A poem should be broiled
As the rubbing of laborers.
1255 2018-05-05 21:54:30 Buffett could own so much Apple but you shouldn't! Don't depend on one stock! Depend on a multitude as represented by SPY & ACWI! SPY invests in 500  U.S stocks in S&P500. ACWI invests in more than 1300 global stocks. Strength in diversity if you individual investor like me.
1256 2018-05-05 21:54:03 ols, and prohibit detachable stocks and silencers/flash suppressors on rifles, so they can’t be broke down and reconstructed and used. That would reduce tremendously the use of them in these however given the train M-16 attack stopped by three students, the Grocery store attack,

But market forces also cause non-rationale behaviours. There's risk, then there's 'risk.' A better q, perhaps: should we put housing into the same category of risk as stocks? Is a house a home, or just a pure investment play?
1263 2018-05-05 21:42:49 And the "that's just stocks" excuse doesn't really hold water, since by his own admission he just... cashes out $1 billion of that a year to spend on rockets. There's a lot of things you can do with $1 billion/year dude.

1266 2018-05-05 21:37:10 Democrats and Liberals want to implement rules that make it much more difficult for mentally disabled to get access to guns. They want to improve background checks. You promised to make socalled "bump stocks" unlawful. You failed. Again. SAD.

1274 2018-05-05 21:28:45 Should in not be the stocks you own? If you have dead ducks you will remain invested in them in theory as no one else will buy them
1275 2018-05-05 21:26:11 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
1276 2018-05-05 21:24:48 Bitcoin, Mortgage fraud, stocks and bonds/ mob ties, blood oaths, you better watch your mom.  ‘How to make a million’ coming soon. #onancientscrolls
1277 2018-05-05 21:24:02 normalement y'a assez de stocks mais au pire tu te dépêches une fois que le concert est fini :/
1278 2018-05-05 21:23:16 IM READY FOR THEM CANDY STOCKS, knowing you you'll make them healthy and cheaper then the than the competition XD
1279 2018-05-05 21:18:44 Seriously fake media and their contributors have no stake in judging a entrepreneur like @elonmusk . Tell to the people who lost all the money in every stock market crash due to your pump and dump of stocks. Short sellers like @AlderLaneeggs do the job of media .
1280 2018-05-05 21:18:06 That’s fair.  Everyone has different strategies.  And I agree these stocks are good for a trade if you time if right.  
1281 2018-05-05 21:15:51 Fake news Donald. The democrats don’t want to disarm Americans. They want common sense laws like no bump stocks or automatic weapons and how about universal background checks no matter where you purchase a gun?  If you would check, the vast majority of Americans are ok with this
1282 2018-05-05 21:13:52 There was a law that prevent people with mental health issues but one of the first thing Trump did when he took office was to cancel that law. Also what about when Trump said he was gonna nan bump stocks, still nothing has been done, what's the matter is Trump scared of the NRA?
1283 2018-05-05 21:13:02 GUO YIN UNITY stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
1284 2018-05-05 21:10:45 The hype is what brings the retail, no? I haven’t been doing this for very long, but I saw how the story of lithium shortage and shortage of cannabis along with the “coolness” of owning MJ stocks drove the story which brought flocks of retail and drove price. I’m in it for 1/2
1285 2018-05-05 21:08:10 Wanted one of those Horde zip up hoodies (like hte Alliance one I have) but J!NX no longer stocks them.

1287 2018-05-05 20:58:40 Only 49 of the S&P 100 stocks are above their 200-DMA.  +1 on the week #stocks
1288 2018-05-05 20:58:09 Yes it can! If you look up a symbol, you can view the company profile page which includes the stocks volume. ^ZW
1289 2018-05-05 20:57:52 Remember, the lefts idea of reasonable gun control, is a SWAT team knocking down your front door, throwing a flash bang into the room. pointing their M16's in your face so they can confiscate your pistol grips and adjustable stocks.
1290 2018-05-05 20:57:18 Sure sure, I'm so glad we can quantify the definition of MASS SHOOTINGS as a defense for the bullshit the NRA pulls every day...and ya know, an AR-15 isn't an assault weapon and people need those bump stocks and hi-capacity mags for HUNTING...yeah HUNTING, that's it.

Fuck off.
1291 2018-05-05 20:56:28 I hope i get enough money from my stocks to pay off all of my credit cards.

1294 2018-05-05 20:49:45 High capacity magazines and bump stocks. Let's begin with those. That's me defining it for you. Now Granny, can you justify why any sane person should own those?
1295 2018-05-05 20:47:09 画像漁ってたら無理になってしまっら
1296 2018-05-05 20:47:05 Trump promised Americans that he would support reasonable gun control measures and banning bump stocks. I have seen no movement on these issues and he continues to receive $ from the NRA.  He never intended to honor his promises to the families at Parkland. Sad and disgusting.
1297 2018-05-05 20:46:36 Thanks for idea.  U like the setup of the marijuana stocks overall here? Was going to dip my toe in, thinking of buying the etf as a lower risk play
1298 2018-05-05 20:45:56 buffet afaik never understood technology and hence stayed away from tech stocks. BH first investment if i am not wrong was in liberty global in 2014.
1299 2018-05-05 20:45:34 Then why are we banning bump stocks?
1300 2018-05-05 20:43:09 I notice that it conveniently leaves out mental health which is the main commonality of mass shootings after gun free zones.  This is ignorant and going after the wrong reasons.  Also bump stocks are being banned as well as anything that makes a gun act like an automatic

1302 2018-05-05 20:36:10 The economy has never been this large before. If u look at the stocks of most companies that have been around more then 30 years. In the mid 80s they shoot up and keep going up bc we move off the gold standard and into the oil dollar. It's not that big a deal when minwage is 12.
1303 2018-05-05 20:34:42 yoof (2 x 18 year olds) setting the worlds to rights talking about stocks and shares, crypto, house prices, gold, feminism. Struggling with jetlag but fun to listen.
1304 2018-05-05 20:34:21 Think of it as wealth in the form of both financial and production assets already invested in the business. For example, an amazon truck, warehouse and stocks are all part of a capital but Besos' personal gold toilet isnt. Its supposed to measure the value of production
1305 2018-05-05 20:30:34 Charlie Munger on newspaper #stocks Berkshire holds: We may have miscalculated on newspapers. We did not foresee the fast decline. But we will surely miss newspapers if they disappear.

1307 2018-05-05 20:27:57 I'd be willing to bet that this is a reflection of how much capital John Henry has invested in fossil fuel stocks or futures.
1308 2018-05-05 20:24:01 Buffett - on tech stocks, he made the mistake by not being able to judge that their prospects were far better than their price. On Amazon, Bezos has done something close to a miracle.
1309 2018-05-05 20:23:57 non pf my friends gota raise. But my brother (CEO) bought back stocks and got a high 6 digit bonus due to Trump tax scam. The world is laughing at that Banana Republic Trumpland whos narcistic president  is a provable money laundering mobster.
1310 2018-05-05 20:20:37 You mean white women of privilege.  This white woman never supported that asshole. & not that many I know did.  Desperate old white women (65+) maybe...  Those who are widowed getting their husbands pention & soc sec, with stocks/bonds & savings account
1311 2018-05-05 20:20:27 You dont own your stocks..indirect ..they are yours, you bought them to manage your financial " consumption" so spare me that argument. What your money does every second around the world is your responsibility

1323 2018-05-05 20:08:50 Yup.  If I own dividend paying stocks I have a claim on cash flows that asset generates and I can do a dcf valuation on the stock.  Not true of the crypto listed.
1324 2018-05-05 20:07:45 Dear Ville..you own the stocks but not emissions..hmmm nice way of seeing it..so you privitise profit and socialise cost..even better..but that is not so reaponsible or human.

1326 2018-05-05 20:05:45 In a Peter Lynch book, he says that his picks tended to do better than the market when the it went up and worse when it went down. At first, this was disappointing to read since I was hoping to learn more than "own high-beta stocks in a long bull market", but thinking further...

1340 2018-05-05 19:54:50 I thought Tom Barrack was the single dumbest investor of the decade, and that was before $CLNS stock went down 90% this year. He bought physical real estate (selling at 30-50% discount) when real estate stocks were off 85%.

1355 2018-05-05 19:34:45 At Birkshire Hataway's AM Q&A, Warren Buffet "attacks" gold for poor performance compared to investing in stocks. This makes no sense: gold was money until 1971 (gold standard/gold exchange standard). So is he comparing holding cash to investing; i.e., not investing to investing?
1356 2018-05-05 19:33:13 People worried about the stocks are idiots.  The price changes after every article written about @Tesla Money is imaginary and completely irrelevant, but stocks take it to an entirely new level.  Though, I have invested in @Tesla for the long haul.  Big rig pun Intended.
1357 2018-05-05 19:31:33 Sorry Dude, but I'm not wrong. Every outlet in America says at least 70-82% of Americans want stricter background checks, bump stocks banned, large magazines banned and I've not heard one logical excuse for why one needs an AR-15. So yeah, @davidhogg111 speaks for the majority

1359 2018-05-05 19:30:25 "As mutual funds gear up to be compliant and restructure  portfolios, there is likely to be a considerable selling in the small  cap space
churning of portfolio is expected to lead to an investment of about Rs  190 billion in mid-cap stocks, at the cost of large- and small-caps."
1360 2018-05-05 19:29:34 Does that include bump stocks that you (the NRA) supported a regulatory ban on?
1361 2018-05-05 19:28:38 Why not include Onecoin, too? Or any digital fiat? Or some stocks? It's flawed and *arbitrary*, pushed to make their altcoin look relatively stronger against... wait for it... Bitcoin. Bitcoin is 100% dominant.
1362 2018-05-05 19:28:30 Maybe add a whithered bonnie pop figure pls reply it in stocks In case you’re wondering
1363 2018-05-05 19:23:31 How you ask...simple. They are not billionaires by selling bananas at the corner shop. Predictability is key to playing stocks on the exchange. A volatile market creates spikes in the Bull and Bear cycles. Knowing what is about to happen will make them TONS of money.
1364 2018-05-05 19:22:32 There are about 240M adult Americans. About 50% of those are invested in stocks. So 40K is about 0.03% of Americans who are invested in stocks.
1365 2018-05-05 19:19:26 Oh yeah, great! I'm guessing you own stocks in gun companies? Or are your Russian buddies just laundering money through the NRA?

1378 2018-05-05 19:04:46 Then either you haven't paid any attention to the parkland kids' proposals or your definition of sensible widely varies with the majority. Ban assault rifle sales, bump stocks, no guns for mentally unhealthy, much stronger registration laws for transfers, etc.

1404 2018-05-05 18:34:10 Funny how you never hear of Las Vegas and the shooter there anymore. That was a cover-up.
The idea that a SINGLE 60+ yr old was capable of firing more than 1150 rounds out of multiple SEMIAUTO rifles...in 10mins.
Is fucking ridiculous, given gun spacing & bump stocks?
Yah right
1405 2018-05-05 18:33:05 haha never. marijuana advocate for decades. have zero care about pot stocks. but marijuana itself.. huge part of my life
1406 2018-05-05 18:33:04 Trading volume at #PSX has gone down alarmingly low. There is a serious need of some liquid product. The market needs stocks with free float and lots of them.

If they want something else, they need to go to the investment community, and promote blockchain use/tokenization of stocks, then have at it.  Stop pissing on other people's ideas, post hoc.

1465 2018-05-05 17:36:03 It's just such a shame that bump stocks for knives are still legal. There's NOTHING more dangerous than a fully automatic knife.
1466 2018-05-05 17:34:59 Your a phony Donald! The NRA called and you suck it up!
You’ve done nothing on bump stocks or mental health checks for weapon purchases!
Phony illegitimate President!

1467 2018-05-05 17:32:20 You need an assault rifle with bump stocks?
1468 2018-05-05 17:31:30 Useless to argue with NRA members, they will not concede:  Reforming background checks and banning bump stocks might be good for America.  They just keep railing "they will take our guns!"  Trump said he would "ban bump stocks and background checks not working"!  How does this
1469 2018-05-05 17:31:29 It has happened several occasions when stocks have been too steeply priced
1470 2018-05-05 17:28:11 Back then I used to hate Warren Buffet for buying cigarette stocks, but now that I'm older it only makes sense.

1472 2018-05-05 17:26:03  But, why are wages STILL stagnant. Us common folk were supposed to benefit greatly be these corporate tax cuts. I’m doing well...I have a 401k, Class A and B stocks a nice retirement plan. But, most ppl don’t. I haven’t gotten a raise in 2 years.
1473 2018-05-05 17:24:22 Uh, just constantly. Banning bump stocks and AR-15's does NOT equate to taking all the guns away from law-abiding citizens.. I would be the first to protest if it were.
1474 2018-05-05 17:22:37 its pretty sad how High Schoolers are putting more effort into balancing societies than adults are. @realDonaldTrump we meed to ban AR-15 and bump stocks. Background checks to purchase guns are a Must to keep America safe.
1475 2018-05-05 17:21:36 I REALLY wish that you lived up to this tweet. When you support gun regulation (such as banning bump stocks) it makes it REALLY hard to support you. #DoBetter

1480 2018-05-05 17:19:40 THIS JUST IN: Stocks down with no mention from Trump in months but hey here's 1 good stat that I had nothing to do with so let's talk about it instead
1481 2018-05-05 17:18:55 He would argue that his Sharpe ratio is higher than a tech exposed strategy because his exposure is to steady Eddie cash flow businesses and public holdings across consumer staples, financial services, and other low volatility blue chip stocks. It is a strong argument.
1482 2018-05-05 17:17:39 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
1483 2018-05-05 17:16:55 yeah, it's poorly worded Kyle but it isn't exactly false either.

immediately after the parkland tragedy, trump went full gun control on live TV.

he still hasn't stopped trying to ban bump stocks either, and if you don't know, that's a backdoor way to ban all semi-autos.

1491 2018-05-05 17:04:30 I see your point about semi automatics which fire single shots. But then bump stocks must be banned to avoid turning them into automatics and thus assault rifles.
1492 2018-05-05 17:04:23 Let's add this @FoxNews after one year of Trump Rule yes rule not Govern, we're is the Ivanka clothing being manufacture not in America. Russian ilegal I immigration is up, MILK IS 3 DOLLARS AND RISING, gas is 3 dollars and going up. No health care, stocks are frozen in time.
1493 2018-05-05 17:04:23 so many rackets and stocks breakers lost their minds during 2006 they became just like a pen editor who just have few ink drops at his inkwell , while he was about to finalize his novel then the inkwell fell over the table.

Value simply represents something that is valued. Nothing intrinsic to human nature makes people value these things over each another.

1500 2018-05-05 16:50:10 Financial securities, like shares or equity in traditional assets, like stocks, venture funds and real estate are securities. Asset-backed tokens (we call them Proof of Asset tokens) give investors a legal claim to the profits of the underlying asset = security tokens.

1503 2018-05-05 16:49:08 Should be arrangeable, but of course is not going to happen. While watching the $BRK shareholders meeting trading less and owning longer is what got my mind. You should own stocks instead of trading them. One day/ week to trade, six to rethink.
1504 2018-05-05 16:48:11 The armed police on the MSD campus did NOTHING!  Please stop parroting the inaccurate theme of "taking away our guns" because that isn't what they are saying.  They want to reform the background checks system.  They want to ban bump stocks.  Trump said he wanted this too.

1511 2018-05-05 16:36:44 He's saying what the majority of America is thinking. Trump promised gun reform in the form of banning bump stocks after Vegas and Parkland and failed to follow through.

1512 2018-05-05 16:36:36 It does not, and StockTwits does not discuss OTC stocks either.
1513 2018-05-05 16:35:07 Just a heads up, the dividends from stocks and interest on your cash are completely different things - comparing them apples to apples is a little short sighted since there's risk involved (1.75% on s&p isn't why you own that.. it's the ~7% annual return)

1528 2018-05-05 16:24:06 Yen Beat Dollar as the Strongest in Yields Driven #Forex #Markets And thus, it provided little support to Dollar over the week. Stocks were also mainly driven by earnings as DOW engaged in very volatile trading inside recently established range. The pattern from 3.035 so far…
1529 2018-05-05 16:24:05 Simply V is present at most German supermarkets. Luckily the local Rewe sells it, so it's easy to keep stocks. There is another brand they sell at the healthfood store, but it smells so terrible (sour, as if it had expired). Violife exists here only in slices ...

1533 2018-05-05 16:17:32 Buffett: My first inclination is to comb through US stocks over other regions in the world. If you cant find in China, UK US etc you probably wont find it anywhere else.
Munger: I already have a large percentage of my net worth in China. It s a good hunting ground for me.
1534 2018-05-05 16:17:31 That fresh rubber, balance and alignment feeel >>> my shits mint now, might stay on stocks all szn.
1535 2018-05-05 16:17:18 If Buffett only had $1 billion, he might consider emerging markets. Reminiscing about buying several Korean stocks 10 years ago. But his first inclination is always to first comb through opportunities within the USA. His problem is size, not geography. Charlie likes China stocks.

1571 2018-05-05 15:44:44 Serious question: what percentage of the average's stocks market cap is traded each day?  I could do it for individual stocks but I know  could bias the number by my selection
1572 2018-05-05 15:44:11 Munger: Mark to market valuations of stocks in the portfolio should be disclosed. He then takes a familiar swing at the accounting profession. Buffett only objects to mark to market figures appearing in the income statement.

1584 2018-05-05 15:31:42 Comparing bump stocks to the inclusion of VA recipients being added to the prohibited list in NICS is silly.
1585 2018-05-05 15:31:23 Stock buy backs put money into the economy and increase the value of stocks. That’s good for anyone who owns stocks. Admittedly, the impact to the overall economy is minor, but it certainly doesn’t siphon money out of the economy.
1586 2018-05-05 15:29:07 No I will not.

1614 2018-05-05 15:06:19 Large caps are subtler & seeminlgy harder to 'get it' than penny stocks & why so many make a beeline to penny stocks.  But once u make this hurdle in understanding the more refined, yet much more tangible, repeating patterns intrinsic to large caps, you'll see how reliable it is.
1615 2018-05-05 15:05:50 Not true at all, just look south of the border as regulations and taxes get cut and unemployment goes down while wages and stocks rise.  If you prefer socialism or some other system just come out and say it!

1617 2018-05-05 15:05:31 I put fiat into crypto the same way I do with stocks. Little by little buying solid (not speculative) projects. I’m in for the long term. I also set a bit aside to trade since it’s high risk.
1618 2018-05-05 15:03:55 Also Trump hasnt changed my life for the better at all my taxes went up, i lost my insurance, my stocks and retirements ha gone done because he is a loud mouth and scares every company in america. Puerto Rico is still a mess so tell me how he has made my life better exactly
1619 2018-05-05 15:01:03 Which version of themselves? Present or Future?

Stocks, with reasonable alotment help remove stress long term. The biggest thing we should be doing is teaching financial literacy and longer-term planning.
1620 2018-05-05 14:59:52 Yes, BTC is just based on a lie, unlike the dollar, treasury bonds, euros, Yen, pounds, stocks and derivatives, which are all backed up by incorruptible, honest, and trustworthy politicians, bankers, regulators, law enforcement, courts, lawyers and judges.

1629 2018-05-05 14:52:24 The reason we resort to guessing in trading esp. unnecessary w large caps stocks, is because our brains haven't acquired the needed patterns to make moves accurately & we simultaneously feel the need to want to do something, overestimating our own ability to guess correctly.

1649 2018-05-05 14:41:48 The NRA oppose background checks; they oppose limits on magazine capacity; they oppose limiting the sale of armor-piercing ammunition; and they oppose banning bump stocks. And those are just a few of the ways they fight to keep us less safe against the possibility of murder.

1652 2018-05-05 14:40:40 Yeah a .410 Taurus Judge (gimmick) is more effective than a 12 gauge. Your depth of knowledge is glaring. You probably also think bump stocks make weapons more dangerous.   Too many video games.
1653 2018-05-05 14:40:27 Daghanag stocks hehe
1654 2018-05-05 14:40:26 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1655 2018-05-05 14:39:40 Let me translate what this Clifford guy is saying: “I don’t understand how finances work and think about stocks on a short term basis only”
1656 2018-05-05 14:39:07 One of the #stocks I also will buy in next time.  Good company.
1657 2018-05-05 14:38:46 Is it any wonder that I'll be sleeping in my car at the end of the month

1658 2018-05-05 14:37:36 Day two of my trip with #oleobrigado:  a visit and tasting to #orleansborbon , the sherry bodega for the Sapnish royal family!  We tasted through the stocks, and saw a great demo barrel with the famed #flor yeast!  #farmsteadCW #jerez.
1659 2018-05-05 14:36:50 2) he did not shut down companies, the companies shut down..
1660 2018-05-05 14:36:44 True visionary! Also, such stocks rarely trade cheap...
1661 2018-05-05 14:36:26 With trading skill, especially with large cap stocks (penny stocks are a wilder breed), you should get to the point where no guessing is needed AT ALL.  It's based entirely and purely on patterns alone.  So that nullifies the point for swing trading or holding throughout the day.
1662 2018-05-05 14:36:02 1) Never said he had no choice, I said he had to make a choice and given the pace at which the us recovered, he made the right one.

1664 2018-05-05 14:34:19 GM was a vice president, then president at a bank, GF managed lrg store n Hawaii. She left him close to a half a million when she died in 2008, in stocks alone, not counting cash. This was no middle class family.

1666 2018-05-05 14:31:43 Regarding S Cohen’s false/ FSB version of events in #Odesa on 2 May, 2014, I watched all of that on live feed TV that day too. “Ethnic #Russians” weren’t “driven into the Trade Union building & locked in”. Russian agents & some locals had their stocks of Molotov cocktails there.
1667 2018-05-05 14:31:08 Like the democrats can take any credit for the economy. Not one democrat supported the tax bill that has been the reason for the economy.  So now it’s a good! Ha you and the other democrats are all laughing stocks. Hope the democrats actions hurt n the 2018 elections. Just say No

1672 2018-05-05 14:25:33 After experiencing such small and tight space today, I must really salute on CF floor management. Enough space for vendors to put their luggages and stocks and is still able to walk inbetween.

1674 2018-05-05 14:25:01 investing tip: spend more at the farmers market than in the stock market. Only stocks I buy are corn stalks
1675 2018-05-05 14:24:22 Gâchés par la faute des écolos dogmatiques et primaires, qui ont imposé sa fermeture. 
Par leur faute, nos stocks de plutonium n'ont cessé d'augmenter depuis.
Alors qu'ils auraient pu nous chauffer et nous éclairer.
1676 2018-05-05 14:23:48 @POTUS. Allowed Jeff Sessions to write legislation criminalizing many thousands of innocents who own bump stocks, to appease the gun grabbing Dems but looking at the way they attack @realDonaldTrump every single day on here, tear up that bad deal it only hurts good men.

1681 2018-05-05 14:17:59 Common sense gun laws doesn't have to mean banning anything. Universal background checks is one thing. But if I (lil ol' me) would ban something, it would be bump stocks because it allows a person to do massive harm very quickly.
1682 2018-05-05 14:17:19 Hey @sainsburys , could you tell me if your Walton on Thames store stocks Free From Cornettos please?
1683 2018-05-05 14:15:28 So always stop searching multibaggers....invest in 40% CAGR compounding stocks...Invest wisely and for long term
1684 2018-05-05 14:15:27 The results look like you woukd be better off stop trading SPY options and focus on stocks
1685 2018-05-05 14:14:45 Another issue that academics don’t fully exploit: Index investors tend to stay the course for LT goals. Traders may suffer deep losses, get frustrated, and abandon stocks altogether, thus losing a wealth source. Worse, some resort to gambling to hopefully switch venues..
1686 2018-05-05 14:14:38 That's what I'm doing. People should realize when an industry is dying..
1687 2018-05-05 14:14:06 The NRA claims 2B a gun safety organization yet it tells patrons 2 avoid establishments who promote gun safety GOOD NEWS the FUTURE of the NRA ASSAULT RIFLES&BUMO STOCKS IS IN PERIL in other words they will b pretty much GONE

1692 2018-05-05 14:11:51 Broker for stocks like fidelity or interactive brokers.
1693 2018-05-05 14:11:47 Warren is the G.O.A.T. of public stocks. He had a legendary run that will be tough for anyone to replicate, but the market sunsetted his value orientation when central banks artificially pumped every asset class for a decade and shifted the winners to growth & momentum factors.
1694 2018-05-05 14:09:45 Yes, thats so definitely Agfacolor.

What I like about film stocks is that they all are biased towards the logo colours of their manufacturer.
1695 2018-05-05 14:09:11 Coal is dead man, coalmines aren't the future...just deal with it.
1696 2018-05-05 14:09:03 Idk why, but I really fucking love M4's with the old school fixed stocks.
1697 2018-05-05 14:08:05 idk why liberals wanna bash trump considering tft unemployment is at its lowest since 2001, as well as improvements in foreign trade, stocks, and the overall economy in the last yearlol some people are never content
1698 2018-05-05 14:07:41 Where would be a good platform to trade $mj stocks / coins etc
1699 2018-05-05 14:07:00 That’s some painfully twisted logic there. The NRA lobbies in favor of assault rifles and bump stocks which have killed hundreds of innocents. PETA had zero to do with the YouTube shooting and she killed no one but herself. Get your facts straight
1700 2018-05-05 14:04:50 Sorry, but facts are facts...the economy was turned around by @POTUS44. Unless you are 1%, your taxes are going up. Stocks are crashing because of @realDonaldTrump ...
1701 2018-05-05 14:04:41 #RedTsunami
1702 2018-05-05 14:03:06 Hmm a couple months ago you were talking about increasing background checks and banning bump stocks. Then Wayne pulled on his ropes attached to you to bring you back in line. Such a coward.
1703 2018-05-05 14:02:45 I don’t we want to disarm the citizens of this country. I want to see common sense gun laws. Raise purchase age, background checks, wait period, no war-type weapons, no bump stocks. How did that get changed to “disarm?”
1704 2018-05-05 14:02:27 I'm so glad you bought it   I think it would really suit you. I was planning to get one for myself too but I need to control my spending :( hahah hopefully the branch in Sm eco will still have stocks of that shirt ;-;
1705 2018-05-05 13:58:12 So asking that we keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have guns is an infringement...How? 

Asking that assault rifles, that no one outside law enforcement or military should have or needs, is an infringement...How?

Getting rid of bump stocks infringes...Who?
1706 2018-05-05 13:58:10 Which site do you use to invest in mining stocks?  Thank you for all the Info.
1707 2018-05-05 13:57:13 Cool thanks, how do they have a portfolio write down at these equity levels though?
Stocks are high, did they have them at unrealistic values on the books?
1708 2018-05-05 13:56:43 Fake news. Anyone that thinks farmers can’t sell soybeans is either dumb or knows nothing about farm commodities. Beans were up .10 per bu. on day China anounced it. Normal trading so far.
1709 2018-05-05 13:55:01 If fail you mean by bringing unemployment down to an 18 year low, letting me keep $1500 a year of my own money, having a $50K jump in my stocks, helping big time in NK and getting real economic growth - I am all for it!
1710 2018-05-05 13:53:01 #Stocks,#Indexes And: even if yesterday's initial rise was juiced by the jobs report, that exogenous influence may have imprinted thus become an endogenous influence in the future. The market, like its constituent entities (investors), has a memory.

1712 2018-05-05 13:51:00 You just took money from your fans & put a middle finger in the faces of every victim of a mass shooting.  Remember when you said you would ban bump stocks?  Then you talked to the NRA/KKK and decided their money was whiter than the lives of the children who were slaughtered. 
1713 2018-05-05 13:50:26 This man is telling me to buy stocks,,,, excuse me sir I’m a communist
1714 2018-05-05 13:48:36 These cookies licked fix to stiletto stocks !
1715 2018-05-05 13:48:07 Also, this is the same Paul Krugman who said there would be a market crash Nov. 9 2016 if HRC didn't win. He said he'd be selling all his stocks and encouraged others to do the same.
1716 2018-05-05 13:47:58 Whatever it is it has put very very large sums of money in my bank account. I'll bet Warren is balls deep in bank and credit card stocks.
1717 2018-05-05 13:47:39 Hey, yes those are dividend returns for a mix of ETFs and stocks. I just list the tickers in the summary. The portfolio page shows which are ETFs and which are stocks.
1718 2018-05-05 13:45:59 401Ks have done better because companies were helped by the Trump tax cuts & deregulation. 
Short term this seems ok but long term??
The tax cuts will cost us money.
Deregulation costs us clean air, water & cancer.
Is it worth it?
IF you own stocks OK, but most Americans don't.
1719 2018-05-05 13:45:42 Somewhere else in this thread, someone suggested parading the culprits through the streets to shame them. I think such public justice would be quite effective in stopping these b*****ds. Maybe put them in the stocks too - prison obviously doesn't work!
1720 2018-05-05 13:45:20 Lol so that's why they were pumping Apple stocks to an all-time high
1721 2018-05-05 13:43:23 Background checks are crazy, bump stocks make sense though... If you're a potential psychopath.
1722 2018-05-05 13:43:06 Thanks for going back on your pledge to limit weapons and ban bump stocks. You’re a lying POS!!!

1724 2018-05-05 13:41:20 It’s not just taxes cuts it’s the increase is retirement & stocks. The ppl also realize that if the economy keeps going the way it’s going their salaries can go up. The ppl are realizing. Besides the forced omnibus bill really pissed a lot of ppl & made PT support stronger

1726 2018-05-05 13:40:09 You have to make decisions to get out of a crisis, the one he took increased debt but enabled the economy to restart by brinking people back to work. Which explains the good results of the us in the last years...what if he hadn't ?
1727 2018-05-05 13:39:12 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I'm jealous!!! I wish after Eid they still have stocks
1728 2018-05-05 13:38:25 He passed Fix NICS and wants to ban bump stocks through back door legislation.  The threat to the 2nd amendment has never been greater.

1739 2018-05-05 13:30:30 BTW any stocks?
1740 2018-05-05 13:30:22 
1741 2018-05-05 13:28:21 I think that is what is most frustrating. It's not that conservatives don't believe it will work for US, it's that they prefer to allow insurance companies, big pharma, and medical establishment to gouge their way to millions & millions in profit. They must own stocks.
1742 2018-05-05 13:24:57 Yung may nakita na naman akong magandang shoes na sneakers type. Problema ko size and stocks.  Kailangan kong iwasan ang sapatos. Nakakaadik. haha.
1743 2018-05-05 13:24:52 Yes. It's become a fancy marketing term. I read an article which said some company stocks went up just because they added 'blockchain' in the company name. They were not even remotely a technology company.
1744 2018-05-05 13:24:16 Thanks Obama!
1745 2018-05-05 13:22:15 Might get a tango to replace or might wait until I can get to a brick and mortar store that stocks them and actually feel the vibrations before I buy!
1746 2018-05-05 13:21:15 Everything says lower to me but it keeps going up. Honestly, not touching it. Too much event risk. Bias is to further upside for tin foil reasons. Will short on steroids in the Fall if/when stocks crash. Sitting tight for now.
1747 2018-05-05 13:21:09 Get in before they’re gone. There until 4pm. Stocks starting to run low
1748 2018-05-05 13:20:34 Now you complain that the jobs created were not the best ones...he stopped the unemployment hemoragy, which enabled the economy to kick off...still not happy.
1749 2018-05-05 13:19:52 Its a gamble, manipulation at its best, for high risk taker only,
1750 2018-05-05 13:19:14 By ranking all stocks' profitability & financial condition metrics, a hldgco comes out as the best. It even has a bargain price & bright prospects
1751 2018-05-05 13:18:40 Remember this was right after the crisis, right ? O made the country recover at an insane pace, much faster than other economies, and the job loss were quickly compensated by his policies. Just compare the recovery speed of the us vs other countries.
1752 2018-05-05 13:17:08 Berkshire ...Q1 ....as expected ,reported results crimped by " marked to mkt " accounting for stocks in portfolio ...and HIM ( Harvey ,Irma,Maria) ,earthquakes and .......next

1759 2018-05-05 13:11:05 So.. that executive order you were working on to do away with bump stocks was all a lie?
1760 2018-05-05 13:11:00 Any good IT stocks in your radar. Kelton 63moons
1761 2018-05-05 13:09:46 You are CONFISCATING Bump Stocks and said that we should FIGHT the #NRA #Can’tBeTrusted
1762 2018-05-05 13:08:03 No it didnt. They never loaded stock
1763 2018-05-05 13:06:47 And maybe 2-3 times a winter we get pounded with a big nor'easter. But everyone just goes to the grocery store and stocks up on crisps ("storm chips") and rides it out.
1764 2018-05-05 13:06:32 Worker incomes could rise by tieing lower tax rates only to profits shared with workers, with higher tax rates on profits used to buy back stocks. That would grow economy faster, reduce deficit impact and stock price bubble. Higher wages lead to inflation, profit sharing doesn't.
1765 2018-05-05 13:04:15 1 hour of work a week is now considered employment. That's how these criminals manipulate the statistics do that they look better than reality. Don't believe them for a second #potus #maga #trukp #DonaldTrump #markets #WallStreet #stocks
1766 2018-05-05 13:03:34 bump stocks decrease the accuracy tremendously. it was only useful in the las vegas shooting because he was spraying at a crowd from a distance and accuracy wasnt important. it wouldnt be useful in any other mass shooting scenario.
1767 2018-05-05 13:03:12 I know that feeling. We'll be the first in the stocks when Rowling is made Empress.
1768 2018-05-05 13:02:19 True story: earlier this year I began fretting I was missing on all these STOCK MARKET GAINS Trump constantly bragged about. I almost put everything have (which is not a lot) into stocks one Sunday night but couldn't pull the trigger. Next day, stock crashes all around.
1769 2018-05-05 13:01:37 Says the guy trying to ban bump stocks and raise the age limit for buying rifles. Either you support gun rights, or you don’t.
1770 2018-05-05 13:00:42 Do you even know what a strawman argument is? lol. You said the AR15 should  only be used by the military. I said that doesn't make sense because the military has never used the AR15 and has no use for it. That isn't a strawman argument.bump stocks lower the accuracy tremendously
1771 2018-05-05 12:59:56 i will have a batch 2, no worries. may stocks naman SM :) kakarestock lang nila so madami dami pa haha

1773 2018-05-05 12:58:02 I like clean water and air. Ask the farmers why they won't be able to sell their soy beans. Tax cuts that companies used to buy back their stocks not hiring or raising wages. On small business policies won't speak on it until I research.
1774 2018-05-05 12:56:47 Certainly agree that the majority or citizens want sane gun laws; however, everyone has different definitions for what sane means. UBC, protective order, ban trigger cranks/bump stocks in addition to properly enforcing current laws.
1775 2018-05-05 12:55:34 Yes I.T sold out though
1776 2018-05-05 12:55:29 Reminder of tweet in February "I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!"  This president has no convictions or beliefs.  The only thing he cares about is money!

1784 2018-05-05 12:50:40 President Trump already put into place the removal of bump stocks, it's a start.

1796 2018-05-05 12:35:59 See, they do favor sensible gun control. Honestly, bump stocks aren't all that they're cracked up to be. I bought one, I found that I had diminished accuracy, which was noticeable at distances as small as 100 meters, then sold it. It's a gimmick.
1797 2018-05-05 12:34:32 Again didn't you have a agreement with the train drivers union to get more drivers last year when this was your normal excuse .. how many did you take on ? 0 meaning (what I'm guessing) none or 5 which would cover today's announcement
1798 2018-05-05 12:32:34 misleading tweet. It compares a diversified portfolio vs. single stocks. Would be better to show the track records of each fund instead

1810 2018-05-05 12:23:07 Wages are operating expenses. Operating expenses impact margin. Margin can only increase st the rate of operating income or margin deteriorates. Stocks with deterioration in margin are punished by Wall Street. CEOs have no incentive to increase wages.

1822 2018-05-05 12:10:43 Cool to take individual examples to generalize to the whole country. Full employment has been reached when obama divided unemployment by 2, not thanks to the 1%decrease that happened during last year...and for your taxed you'll repay it soon, it was just to make stupid obedient.
1823 2018-05-05 12:09:20 You are lying. Stock market five day crash this week has wiped out ALL gains for the year. And that extra money in your paycheck they will double back next April 15, dummy. Start watching the news. #Cult45

1837 2018-05-05 11:54:51 If corporations buy back stocks and raise dividends, that is one way to get capital poured back into the economy.  Investors, including workers with pension funds invested in mutual funds, will receive their capital back which will be reinvested in some other business venture.
1838 2018-05-05 11:54:14 @sptulsian but why has he pronounced a sell he could have asked every1 to wait or maybe tulsian wants to again give buy calls and make  a fresh multibagger list and cut down losses of RETAILERS but by then stocks would b in upper circuits for weeks.. so HOLD it is
1839 2018-05-05 11:49:39 Wise words! It’s very true, it’s amazing how quick you can get to who you need to!
1840 2018-05-05 11:48:25 We got a store here in Iida that stocks bottles of it.
1841 2018-05-05 11:48:13 Fully auto illegal, the felony, cant but one, bump stocks, who cares, you don't need it to bump from a firing position. Shotguns are some of the most deadly guns on earth, but they focus on the ar15, which stands for armalite rifles, not automatic rifles, it only shoots semi.
1842 2018-05-05 11:48:09 Ya that’s why Stocks went up 89% of the time and why people are hiring Obama’s hot people to hate police white People and religious people and some even their own country
1843 2018-05-05 11:47:38 Your Capitalist Boom is a Elitist Boom .

1847 2018-05-05 11:40:31 Does the dollar have a price limit..We are not buying shares or stocks
1848 2018-05-05 11:39:19 Agree.  My personal channel checks indicate some sales acceleration into Q1.  Less out of stocks.   Plus timing of new product launches.  Q1 will be 10% plus stronger IMO.   Also last 6 months 45 percent of float was dilution!  Ummmmm - that isn’t happening these next 6!
1849 2018-05-05 11:39:18 So is having a wait 5 days an infringement or a regulation?

How about banning bump stocks?

Banning Silencers?

Passing a background check?

A safe storage requirement?

A test to get a concealed permit?
1850 2018-05-05 11:39:05 they often fail to acknowledge that this 10-yr run in US stocks (and thus indexers) has been fueled by an unprecedented monetary policy backdrop. However, despite underperforming for 10 years the AVERAGE endowment has outpaced the indexers for 20 years.

1867 2018-05-05 11:22:22 Ok I'm up! I'm super interested in how high the Tesla stocks are going to get today. If there is one stock that will make you rich for 296.00 a share, This is it! Get buying before they gain as high as mars.
1868 2018-05-05 11:19:06 I've got a rich history from an earlier stock forum of which a lot of 'admirers' have followed over to twitter. Ever since moving to crypto the majority have stayed on the stocks side of the fence. Like to see it stay that way.

1870 2018-05-05 11:16:25 Nobody is trying to "take ... away" guns from people legally permitted to own them. We are just asking for smart legislation to make people safer. For example, making bump stocks illegal, closing the gun show loophole.

Over 10-15 years, in a 10 stock portfolio - 

2 might go to ZERO 

6-7 might give average returns 

1 or 2 MIGHT give supernormal returns

Slowly moving money from 2 stocks (going to 0) to the last segment gets u ~40% allocation & fabulous returns overall.
1899 2018-05-05 10:43:03 If your ok with Trump taking away your 2nd amendment rights at a rally supporting those very same rights then you would be OK if he bans items like Bump stocks and Extended magazines that make mentally unstable people more capable killers.

I have placed order for Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 on 3rd May. Delivery date is around 2 weeks. It's too much. Please speed up shipment and stocks.  It's very frustrating and disappointing to wait for so long. Thank you.

1912 2018-05-05 10:25:41 What exactly has Trump done, not said, about tighter regulation, bump stocks, AR15 restrictions?

He recinded Obama legislation that restricted gun access to those with diagnosed mental illness.

That helpful?

No point going crazy about stock selection & hunting for 100 baggers! 

It more about ALLOCATION & entry! 

With 100% allocation to 1 stock, even 100% returns is fabulous!

Note - many stocks have 52 week highs, 50% above 52 week lows!

1916 2018-05-05 10:18:25 I don’t know, I get my 5th and 6th shares of stocks this year, 7-9 next year. So I get a nice $4,000 check I can put in savings.
1917 2018-05-05 10:16:32 It is a semi-automatic version of the United States military M16 rifle. Add a bump stock and it IS exactly the same thing. And no, bump stocks aren’t illegal. The ATF is still in the “comment period”
1918 2018-05-05 10:14:44 The pillory always draws a crowd. The shots are cheap. The target is stationary. Naked in the stocks. Leaders are needed by bad teams. Good teams do not need leaders. Some are notable by their inavailibility for interview.
1919 2018-05-05 10:08:46 Now I’ve sown lettuce, rocket, habanero chili, cosmos, night scented stocks, lupine, hollyhocks, sweet william & lobelia 
1920 2018-05-05 10:07:40 Bump stocks increase that to over 800RPM. Dems have introduced legislation to ban them but they can’t get it out of committee. The ATF tried to ban them but we won’t know til 6/27 and it could be caught up in court for yrs.
1921 2018-05-05 10:04:57 Elon, everything will be ok..

1922 2018-05-05 10:01:19 He did not fix the economy he inherited a growing economy from Obama whom fixed the recession then when trumps policies took in 2017 the stocks started dumping especially after creating a trade war and the unemployment rate froze not shrink

1926 2018-05-05 09:49:28 In my view, a lot of index management activities are masking the true picture in the underlying stocks. There is a considerable amount of distribution going on in a lot of sectors and stocks.
1927 2018-05-05 09:49:07 Twitter thinks I want to hear the latest tweets about "Nintendo games" because I follow several Pokémon news accounts and yet stocks that category with 40% tweets unrelated to Nintendo from e-people who like Nintendo, 40% misc video game tweets and then one bulbapedia tweet

1931 2018-05-05 09:40:22 His long term record of value investing is astounding. I wonder if it could be repeated today though. The market is studied so much more intensely than before, making finding true undervalued stocks so much harder. Probably why he advises that 99% of investors shouldn't even try.

1947 2018-05-05 09:20:29 Am amazed with the proliferation of PMS providers. And everyone seems to be getting money. To invest in “undiscovered” stocks. That’s English for small and mid caps. On the other hand MFs are restricting flows into their small and mid cap funds.

1973 2018-05-05 08:43:13 No. The atf in 2010 and 2012 ruled bc there are no moving parts in bump stocks it’s a firearm part and cannot be regulated as a firearm. Thus the Obama admin had to allow them bc the law did not permit them to prohibit it. Never said it was gop fault

2036 2018-05-05 07:27:35 In real business you slight control over the outcome. Like You can fire few guys  that reduces cost. Pure play investing in stocks you cannot do anything other than hope. Buffet that we know now is second group where it can alter outcome.

2045 2018-05-05 07:19:06 Among pharma stocks , one look DIVIS lab for trading next week . It is likely to break out 1200 level in the next week and move higher atleast 5% . One can keep a stop loss at 1180. Rupee depreciation will help the break out.

2053 2018-05-05 07:12:37 do you have enough stocks in your house?
2054 2018-05-05 07:10:52 minsan feeling ko tinatago ng mga saleslady/salesman 'yung mga stocks like pag 'yung gusto ko na pag size ko na, wala na. either tamad lang sila maghanap?? o namamalditahan sila sakin? huhuhaha andamot naman ng tadhana lolll
2055 2018-05-05 07:10:28 Metals may perform better in the coming week. one can buy vedanta at current price [281] for the possible target of 290 with a stop loss at 275.

2061 2018-05-05 07:03:22 I have the same impression that the house wins in cfd especially in small stocks. I am looking for people who know something more about this!
2062 2018-05-05 07:03:07 Stocks soar as inflation fears wane; Apple surges to record high
2063 2018-05-05 07:00:54 Oil price is likely to jump next week above 75 dollar. It means that the rupee will depreciate and the environment is good for IT stocks and bad for banking stocks .

2065 2018-05-05 06:59:38 I remember hearing @TimMorton2 say at a @CIHEastMidlands event that Twitter can help you reach the most senior people you wouldn't  otherwise be able to access. That's really stuck with me & it's a good point in your blog.
2066 2018-05-05 06:59:28 Many thanks for your inspiring suggestion for my 10-year son JC after panel. Hope he could have a lot of fun to find out his favorite stocks!

2067 2018-05-05 06:58:49 i would not say elon musk is a #gamergate supporter if he does not want to go to prison for the same thing as jordan belfort

i think elon musk is being just as professional as the reporters asking him when to sell his stocks lol
2068 2018-05-05 06:57:51 Wait what happened to u considering taking action on gun control, banning bump stocks? I’m guessing your puppet masters at the NRA said no. I hope you know just how weak this make you look.
2069 2018-05-05 06:55:37 US stocks I generally screen average daily value traded above a few mill $. That gives more than enough liquidity for my pos size.. do you use any rule of thumb for ratio of position size vs daily liquidity?
2070 2018-05-05 06:54:49 Par contre il va falloir prévoir des stocks plus important sur les maillots et autres de l’OM pour la saison prochaine @MaillotsFactory 
2071 2018-05-05 06:53:40 One can buy SBI for trading in the coming week . It will try to jump to 260 before the results that is on 17 th May. Keep a stop loss at 232 at closing basis.

2076 2018-05-05 06:40:26 Happens way too often .. someone was telling me about Asian Paints stocks - and for the first time an Asian Paints ad popped up, told a friend about a printing website it popped up too..
2077 2018-05-05 06:39:18 Why not other options that people are buying. $dvn, $ other oil stocks, $nxpi, or just apple
2078 2018-05-05 06:38:59 If Japanese history is any guide this means it is time to start shorting US stocks.

2091 2018-05-05 06:24:15 The main issue at hand is not to change the 2nd amendment at all. What the real fact is to ban assault weapons & bump stocks not to be sold to the average or mentally ill people! No mention of that in your rants at the NRA convention! How much did the NRA donate to your campaign?
2092 2018-05-05 06:22:17 Most crowded trades according to Merrill Lynch: long tech stocks and short USD.....could mean greenback has further to run !!!

2097 2018-05-05 06:14:34 He allowed guns into national parks. I’m glad for those it affects. He actually legalized bump stocks too. He spoke advocating gun bans as the left continues to do.

2105 2018-05-05 06:06:11 I actually am a CCW permit holder, yet the @NRA DISGUSTS me how much money they put into campaigns to ensure responsible gun control isn't passed like banning bump stocks and silencers here in Nevada that would have saved lives during the Vegas shooting. No one needs 59 guns.

2111 2018-05-05 06:02:07 @iamrakeshbansal  Sir...Can you tell me some stocks which has the potential to double in 1 year
2112 2018-05-05 06:00:42 So called assault weapons were banned. The age was raised. There were no bump stocks invented before. It didn't help then and won't now.

2121 2018-05-05 05:49:22 Moral of the story hai : only invest and trade in stocks when you take your own decision and ready to loose money ! What would be left aside is profits :) no point in dragging Tata motors , it will be fine in few years !
2122 2018-05-05 05:48:45 1/ We need common sense gun control. Ban Bump stocks & AR-15’s. Bring back mental health background checks that you got rid of as soon as you could. Kids need to feel safe. U still haven’t mentioned the Waffle House shooter in Nashville.  #CommonSenseGunControl #LiarInChief #NRA
2123 2018-05-05 05:44:59 Please have patience and give time bhai 
Let me assure you that all your stocks are run by quality mgmts and these would surely reward you over the next 3 years 
Many times investors loose opportunities as they are impatient and want instant results
2124 2018-05-05 05:44:26 I know you’re experienced. Your first tweet made it sound like she’s going to sell all her stocks for crypto though .  Apologies.
2125 2018-05-05 05:44:00 With 20 stocks 5% allocation (not risk) Monte Carlo throws some probabilities which are down right scary.

So.. all these rich are either lucky, insanely talented or inside traders.
2126 2018-05-05 05:41:48 Until CEOs quit rigging the price of stocks with buy- backs funded by robbing the middle and working class to give themselves bonuses there can be no trust
2127 2018-05-05 05:40:43 I think we just have to use base rate that value stocks can outperform with tweaking it to gives us good sleep +decent returns. As far as neighbor making higher return syndrome, rmmbr neighbour is lying abt his total networth return: he has poor asset allocation in real estate ;)
2128 2018-05-05 05:38:54 @DavidGFool David, if theory is to buy and hold. How do you decide to buy or sell the two picks recommended each month on stock advisor. Do you buy the teo stocks every month and sell others? Thanks, Micah
2129 2018-05-05 05:36:13 I like garlic but asparagus and I have PTSD.. had to eat 20 stocks a day to dry out when I did competitive bodybuilding. It’s a natural diuretic..
2130 2018-05-05 05:32:46 The only difference between most modern “civilian AR’s” and the M4 is the ability for three round bursts or full auto.  And with bump stocks, even that difference goes away.   Upper end guns with chrome lined barrels, M4 feed ramps and dual staked screws are essentially the M4.
2131 2018-05-05 05:31:08 And you told her "yes, about a month ago. When the stocks were worth something and Bitcoin was cheap"

2134 2018-05-05 05:27:18 You took the first step when you banned bump stocks....busted the Second Amendment. You will go along with the Dems and libs....you always show your lefty colors. Why are all these caravan people people being allowed in the country? YOU are just as bad as the Dems.

2137 2018-05-05 05:22:17 and once again reductio ad absurdum. Slippery slopes are a logical fallacy designed to instill fear.

I have 8 guns. Some rifles, some hand guns, some shot guns. You know what i don't have? High capacity magazines. Bump stocks. An irrational fear of no-buy lists or an NRA card.

2153 2018-05-05 05:03:57 Reliance yes..it's the second highest in terms of market cap..but not itc..HDFC and HDFC bank have a larger market cap and weightage together..and they almost move in sync..they are more FII driven than any other stocks in the index
2154 2018-05-05 05:03:46 In Trump’s speech today he mentioned billions going to school safety, stricter background checks, mental health checks, and he’s banning bump stocks. We have been progressive in gun safety & regulation. Most Dems want gun bans and an amendment repeal. That’s asking for civil war.
2155 2018-05-05 05:02:51 I’ve hit overtime at work every week for 3 months straight 
2156 2018-05-05 05:01:27 No I'm defending the sale because you don't get to tell me what I need to defend myself and my family, and what do bump stocks have to do with anything?
2157 2018-05-05 05:01:22 Are you an expert? Neither am I but I know There’s a lot more in play than deruglation why stocks move up or down.

2163 2018-05-05 04:56:36 And big business can buy back stocks. Where is your facts that business is investing in these areas?
2164 2018-05-05 04:56:35 The fact that he built something doesn't put him beyond critique (or a simple joke). Stocks, unlike crypto, aren't magical Internet money, so if you wreck the finances of your company, you'll eventualy be asked tough questions and cannot simply blame "shorters" to answer them.
2165 2018-05-05 04:55:05 Thats a fair point, I respect that. I do think its a tricky balancing act with the second amendment. Trump wants further background checks with the Fix NICS Act coming in and he’s banned bump stocks. I wouldn’t say he was a coward, just balancing what the American people want.
2166 2018-05-05 04:53:41 sold my $NOK for$DBX and more $PSTG as my foray into some non-gaming stocks continues..

2168 2018-05-05 04:51:49 as far as my understanding goes, most sectors heavyweight stocks hv rallied substantially in this upmove from 9800 odds. more ralky in dem is difficult.only few sectors like pharma nd psubanks hvnt participated which neways dont matter..baaki tou markets hv deir own mind

2180 2018-05-05 04:36:43 So you lied again? What happened to banning bump stocks, limiting magazine sizes and stricter background checks. Oh wait, it was all for show. Seriously, you back whatever in the moment bc you can't control your tongue. #PatheticPresident

2190 2018-05-05 04:23:24 You’re just defending the NRA again.  You are such a liar .  Remember last month you were going to ban bump stocks!!!

2193 2018-05-05 04:18:06 Yes I was very fortunate, I use to sort the M-1 and M-2 gun stocks Bob acquired years before from the army surplus, he had thousands, some had the soldiers carvings in the stocks{ wish I had one now} but their M-1 rifles are the best and I probably had my hands on them.

2204 2018-05-05 04:05:24 I know the stats of the trend day for my stocks but I struggle on the other side. But I made only 2 small long trades having zero patience to hold any longer than my normal target. Ok result but still feels like a loss.
2205 2018-05-05 04:05:24 @XRPTrump @haydentiff  this is scary on a couple parts 1) the danger of an attorney operating in a filed where educa tion is lacking 2)this can create case law allowing for other cryptocurrencies and potentially stocks from subject to suit on the grounds of loss from investments

2211 2018-05-05 03:59:32 I'm not convinced yet! AR's, bump stocks, rapid fire, some ammo's should never be sold publicly
2212 2018-05-05 03:58:29 Mr. President, is their a reason why the defence stocks have fallen so hard?
2213 2018-05-05 03:58:24 Put some cash in stocks boy maybe by 65 I'll be good to retire Idk though
2214 2018-05-05 03:58:21 No law is going to keep nut jobs or criminals from getting guns, high powered ammo, bump stocks, or high capacity mags. Criminals and nut jobs DO NOT care about or obey laws.

2222 2018-05-05 03:44:58 I agree, he should never allowed bump stocks to be regulated or outlawed by ATF and should of come against the restriction of 18 year olds to by rifles.
2223 2018-05-05 03:44:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2224 2018-05-05 03:44:07 Many in the natgas sector really beaten down, Bonavista no different. There is some nice leverage here if natural gas prices can recover. Was one of my best performers in 2016 when O&G stocks were rallying. Hoping for 2.5 at least.
2225 2018-05-05 03:42:50 They ruined it
2226 2018-05-05 03:42:25 I’ll bet you didn’t talk about getting rid of Bump Stocks like you said you would, talk about stricter background checks, raise the age to 21 for buying certain guns, and putting heavy restrictions and/or a full ban on Assault Weapons.
2227 2018-05-05 03:42:13 Says the guy who is all for “Take the guns first” & “ban bump stocks”. Give me a break! “Shall not be infringed!”
2228 2018-05-05 03:41:57 Gotta pick your stocks and believe ... works for me
2229 2018-05-05 03:41:13 He’s probably the Trump cabinet member I would most like to see locked up in the stocks for all to curse. 

And then after that he can start working on paying us back all the environmental conservation money he stole from us. By carrying bricks uphill. One at a time.

2233 2018-05-05 03:38:08 Yeah.. and some politicians  make speeches  against  " bump stocks " and support  all kinds of ' mental health " & " red flag " no due process  laws to take guns from people by police state tactics like the Communist informant & surveillance evil regimes .
Know anyone like that ?
2234 2018-05-05 03:36:46 I hope you remember how much you loved being there the next time a dude, who should be red flagged and background checked is armed with bump stocks and buys numerous assault rifles, shoots a school full of children.  #gunsensevoter #noNRA #WontBackDown @MomsDemand

2236 2018-05-05 03:33:47 Dear $tsla investors. The options market which is probably new or obtuse to most of you, had an exp move of +- 18 before EM opened his mouth on the call.  Learn the options market and how that relates to stocks.  Also stop taking about shorts as if they have no idea how to hedge.

2245 2018-05-05 03:23:47 Stocks have the higher long-term return potential, but also have more short-term volatility, making them more appropriate for younger investors with a long time horizon.
2246 2018-05-05 03:22:51 Now will you please leave bump stocks alone Boss ?

House prices at all time highs! Great if you own a home, sucks if you don't and saving a down payment is not feasible, especially when rent increases faster than your wages.
2251 2018-05-05 03:13:01 Bury your head, but check on your stocks. Got it
2252 2018-05-05 03:12:30 Deregulation, tax cuts and better trade helped bring jobs back and boost the auto industry. Buy Ford stocks at $11 ish per share. It’s cheap because Ford is still paying off some debt. WHEN they paid it off, expect the stock to soar. Ford is the best American car company period.

2258 2018-05-05 03:05:28 You did fail! You failed all those kids from Florida! You promised you would ban semi-automatic rifles, enhance background checks and Outlaw bump stocks. You said you weren't afraid of the NRA. You are though.Your whole presidency is a failure.
2259 2018-05-05 03:04:28 These stocks have great mo. Key is when to sell.  I think we have a nice ride to go. I am not wedded to this space though.  BC is full of losers. I should know I grew up out there.

2265 2018-05-05 02:56:35 Limited ba yung stocks? 
2266 2018-05-05 02:56:24 So you were for helping with background checks, bump stocks but now you ‘’got a talkin to’’ by NRA and their money. You have no soul.
2267 2018-05-05 02:55:48 Hey Jesse, it said"that we are in Phase3 on the way to Phase4,ANDif historical performance patterns hold,then a long commodities/short equities investment strategy might be rewarding."Should I get out of stocks directly tied2 commodities. I have bought PM and uranium stocks
2268 2018-05-05 02:54:54 $MOZ one of my fav. gold stocks on the #TSX bounced nicely this week along with $NSU.
I’ve been long these 2 stocks the last year and possibly more. If you think #gold is going to turn (as I do) these need to be bought
2269 2018-05-05 02:54:14 So does that mean Trump was jerk for suggesting bump stocks get banned, and that little thing about confiscation of guns first and due process second? 
2270 2018-05-05 02:52:46 How can you defend Trump & #NRA after what he/they said and did on bump stocks & age 21? No MORE restrictions on #2ndAmendment!!! #DontBeaZombie
2271 2018-05-05 02:52:15 Everyone praying for a reversal in stocks sounds delusional. The main argument I hear is that stocks peak before we enter a recession, and we're overdue for a recession, and a recession is just around the corner, any time now we'll have a recession... Ergo, get out while you can!
2272 2018-05-05 02:51:42 Your money is hard earned, invest wisely, do your DD, don't follow pumpers, observe for weeks if not months before you take a leap on a new stock, make sure there is total transparency in the company and CEO, this advice is for fortune 500 and penny stocks, it's the same game.

2276 2018-05-05 02:50:05 Should I invest in individual stocks or mutual funds?
2277 2018-05-05 02:49:04 Yeah, anyone who is an "analyst" in marijuana stocks like that fool Chris Damas.

2280 2018-05-05 02:45:34 When I ask them to prove their claims they block me. Cowards.

Yesterday a trumptard said that his stocks had doubled under trump. I asked him to name three stocks that have doubled under trump. Blocked.
2281 2018-05-05 02:45:23 #UncleWarren and #ValueStocks sucked too just before the tech bubble burst. Maybe @realDonaldTrump will bust up $AMZN for monopoly/predatory pricing thereby deflating everything FANG-ish, and value stocks will rule again soon!

2284 2018-05-05 02:44:32 Y los stocks? Se agrava la crisis de los súper?
2285 2018-05-05 02:44:06 What happened to "we are going to raise the age to 21, ban bump stocks,etc??? You lying POS traitor in chief! You said you weren't afraid of the NRA. You just showed your true colors. Watch out for the blue tsunami.
2286 2018-05-05 02:42:01 But then again Business Wire is owned by Berkshire Hathaway whom just a bought a whole load more of $AAPL stocks when the rest of the market were doubting on the numbers couple weeks ago. Kudos to Warren Buffett!!!
2287 2018-05-05 02:38:59 I have my old proxies from Tuesday up and none of them are working, I know they're the old ones based on the quantity.  not sure whats going on
2288 2018-05-05 02:36:31 May plushies? Baka ubusan rin ng stocks
2289 2018-05-05 02:35:35 Thanks for inclusion the @ZacksResearch interview on @BlueStarIndexes & #Israeli #Tech #Stocks.
2290 2018-05-05 02:32:28 Okay so I have bought stocks like Ricoh India, Supreme Infra, Core projects which all went to almost 0 and yet I did more 30% cagr over the last 10 years or so ..its dumb to even want to get all your picks right .. this just means you don’t understand the depth of uncertainty4/n
2291 2018-05-05 02:32:24 So much of that last run it would pop on weekend sell of Monday before the bell.  Put a damper on the Bitcoin stocks.  Would annoy the piss out of me.
2292 2018-05-05 02:29:50 Even the great RJ bought stocks like A2Z which didn’t do well.. so are u guys saying you are better than RJ now that you never bought PCJ..The fact that you wanna be perfect in a highly unpredictable phenomena called markets shows you are either lying or misleading 3/n
2293 2018-05-05 02:28:30 Stacking penny stocks
Hoping 1 of them pop
2294 2018-05-05 02:27:09 The same folks also own stocks which may end up being dubious small caps but if price goes its good management and goes down it is bad quality. Hypocrisy at its best 2/n
2295 2018-05-05 02:27:01 Last 21 trading days: $SPY +.14%, $DIA -.98%, $QQQ +2.63%, FAANG stocks +7.40%. And the FAANG ( $FB, $AAPL, $AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOG) stocks are pulling the Nasdaq up as well.
2296 2018-05-05 02:25:16 I think since everybody is short selling Tesla stocks I'm going to buy a whole bunch now, since my price is guaranteed and I'll just hold on to those bad boys for the long term. Short is awesome if you know how to handle the shortness.
2297 2018-05-05 02:24:46 ako nga nung nagrocery ako para sa stocks sa tindahan ko napalingon ako nung may sumigaw na mama dun sa sales lady kung meron daw silang hygienix kasi wla pa naman naka display
2298 2018-05-05 02:23:28 It's pretty clear you are anything but a Democrat if you oppose common sense gun safety measures like universal background checks, red flag laws, and prohibitions on high capacity mags & bump stocks. These measures will save lives & won't infringe on my right or yours.
2299 2018-05-05 02:23:20 Yes, stocks are up for STD pharmaceuticals!
2300 2018-05-05 02:23:02 Oh, you know me.  Traveling to Chicago by myself, stopping by CVS daily to buy all the meds my wife usually stocks up on.
2301 2018-05-05 02:22:54 The video I sent you shows how aggressive U of Phoen*x was when she signed up for admission information. And how stocks for For-Profit Colleges  after the 2016 election 
2302 2018-05-05 02:22:40 And don't forget about shipping and logistics around the holidays. It will be very interesting to see if tokens like cargoX/shipchain will pump like the shipping stocks do.
2303 2018-05-05 02:21:32 I wanted to eat Chipotle but did not want to go out so I tried first time #doordash and it was great !! On time and delivered my food while it was still warm.
2304 2018-05-05 02:20:48 Look what's pushing markets up: 1. Corporate tax cuts? ( which feeds into corporate greed and will have a burden on national debt) 2. Stock buybacks? ( toxic way of pumping the stocks vs organic growth) 3. Unemployment?( But no wage growth while home prices skyrocket) 4. Buffett?
2305 2018-05-05 02:20:02 Yes the go to source for the real marijuana stocks value #dumpthem #overvalued #nomoneytobemade #growyourown

2307 2018-05-05 02:17:35 Claims to be “the leading authority on cannabis stocks”, yet only pumps ones he’s been paid for and does NO ACTUAL due diligence. Hasn’t got a clue on Village Farms, yet bashes it. I’ve received a number of hilarious emails regarding him today at least.
2308 2018-05-05 02:17:26 my allergies need to chill.
2309 2018-05-05 02:12:40 for online trading ur not allowing nationalised bank cheque for payment #no mapping for them. kindly do the needful in this matter.Thanking you in anticipation.
2310 2018-05-05 02:11:57 Ganown? That's inefficient use of cash. Redeem mo na preferred stocks puhlease
2311 2018-05-05 02:11:26 Way to go....start messing around with teacher retirement stocks!!!!!
2312 2018-05-05 02:11:20 Stocks plunged as Jabil Circuit, Inc. unveiled a hysterical piece of gum today.
2313 2018-05-05 02:10:18 HBC is owned din ata by the Hortalezas, na president ng Splash Corp, makers of Hygienix. Kaya siguro meron silang stocks. In fairness, mabango ang Hygienix soap. Kahit maliit na yung soap, mabula pa rin at di nagiging sobrang tigas ang soap. Quality product din ang Hygienix.
2314 2018-05-05 02:09:31 But no one ever points out that once you start making money more opportunities become available. He didn’t make all his money trading stocks. His company’s stock price broke the 200k mark. At that price per share he can buy more than we could even imagine. Any company he wanted.
2315 2018-05-05 02:07:59 Insomnia, you sweet-toothed old rascal.
You just want me to bake.
I'll reduce custard stocks, if you keep this up.
2316 2018-05-05 02:07:48 @GunOwners why am I supporting you again?  F'ing bump stocks??  Get your priorities in order
2317 2018-05-05 02:07:21 No, as he pointed out Tesla stock is one of the most shorted stocks on the market. He is bombastic in his comments and his growing companies has growing pains. The demand for Tesla is undeniably at an all time high. Yes big money is scared but the people have spoken by orders.
2318 2018-05-05 02:07:20 And for people making money off gun manufacturer stocks
2319 2018-05-05 02:07:19 Nobody needs to stand on a game of Texas hold' em. Stocks market as well? If so, no bank trades cards in it.
2320 2018-05-05 02:07:13 That guy was pumping garbage stocks in 2014. Oh well

2335 2018-05-05 01:44:40 $FSLR $SOL $JKS time to long solar stocks. the logic is that oil price will go up and energy price will go up, solar is part of that.
2336 2018-05-05 01:41:49 Made up argument, no effort to ban all guns. Also vans and trucks are useful, explain why civilians need semi auto weapons with high cap magazines, and bump stocks and and why can't they wait until a background check is completed.
2337 2018-05-05 01:41:03 Wrong! Obama DID NOT endorse bump stocks. The ATF interpreted the current law to mean non-spring loaded bump stocks were a firearm part # so not regulated. They did ban bump stocks containing a spring mechanism that converted a semi-auto weapon into an automatic which is banned.
2338 2018-05-05 01:39:06 Trump is going to ruin the economy, by the time he leaves office stocks will be worth less than when he started. You don’t know how spoiled you were under obama. I hope you cry.
2339 2018-05-05 01:38:30 Danial Sanchez wins stocks @Limaland
2340 2018-05-05 01:37:52 The economy??? WTF are tou talking about? Jesus you are stuck in 2012. The economy is booming under Trump, no thanks to you morons. Best job market in 70 years. Stocks BOOMING and taxes cut. Just stay out of the way and let the Billionaire, who knows what he is doing, run things.
2341 2018-05-05 01:37:41 if anyone has any resources that they are willing to share on stocks and investments please do so!

need all the resources possible.
2342 2018-05-05 01:36:14 i think i’m finally ready to learn about investing, stocks and ‘how to become a home owner’
2343 2018-05-05 01:35:26 I’m saying trade him because he’s been good not bad, his stocks at his highest
2344 2018-05-05 01:34:54 I love when my stocks and crypto go up
2345 2018-05-05 01:33:03 That does it for this evening. Join us next friday night as Spartan Stocks, Michigan Legends, and pony stocks are on hand.
2346 2018-05-05 01:32:25 Did you get the NRA to agree to banning bump stocks and assault riffles? I thought not. I guess we will have to be satisfied with your “thoughts and prayers” .
2347 2018-05-05 01:32:06 You have already failed.  Look at the polls.  You promised you would do away with bump stocks and you didn’t.  You promised the kids you would fight the NRA and introduce a gun control bill.  You didn’t.  You have failed on every level.  @davidhogg111
2348 2018-05-05 01:29:53 Sorry Mr. President! You are talking  out of two sides of your mouth. By signing the Budget you have already undermined the 2nd Ammendment. What’s next Bump stocks, the right to conceal carry, the right to have any guns. I find it hard to believe you are on the side of the NRA.
2349 2018-05-05 01:29:49 If they owned mutual funds focused on health industry stocks then it would be practically the same thing.  They shouldn't be allowed to own stocks or mutual funds.
2350 2018-05-05 01:28:56 What about the gun control you talked about. Raising ages to buy, banning bump stocks. The NRA’s got you by the short hairs! What a WUSS. Worst president ever!!!!
2351 2018-05-05 01:28:32 Increase regulations on buying guns on the internet and gun shows. Increase length of time for background checks. Raise age to 21. Outlaw bump stocks and automatic guns and rifles. Did you tell them?
2352 2018-05-05 01:26:10 I never knew bro, I’m researching more with stocks n learning as I go
2353 2018-05-05 01:26:01 Did he ever sign that executive on bump stocks..
2354 2018-05-05 01:21:15 Lol... The party continues! Dow baba came back again thanks to tech stocks. Look for rub off effect here? Kotak, Indusind and HDFC bank are strong stocks for trading long on intraday dips. Nifty 10620 remains key for short term momentum.. Remain very very selective. Fyi...
2355 2018-05-05 01:21:07 Both crude and Indian stocks have risen together in the past... Fiscal negative though, but only conclusion is yes, equity can rise even when crude is high...Will it happen this time aswell? Don't know!
2356 2018-05-05 01:19:03 I started with my 401K into a few little shitcoins, and once those all 4-5X'ed, I got greedy and sold all my stocks to go all in.
2357 2018-05-05 01:15:42 He was talking about going back into stocks within the year. That's what he said on the live chat.
2358 2018-05-05 01:14:19 Or time to buy stocks in BP.
2359 2018-05-05 01:13:45 $CHEK How come this never happens to any of the stocks that I short?
2360 2018-05-05 01:13:42 There's no chance it trades in this channel for a few months IMO. It's either going significantly up or staircasing down. The 50/200 dmas are right at this level, nor do any stocks in the OTC trade in a sideways channel for too long.
2361 2018-05-05 01:13:27 Bump stocks? I believe they were banned last year. But you keep reporting yourself senator if it makes you feel good because sure as hell you aren’t doing a thing for your state...oh wait, you are doing something you are supporting illegals over Americans citizens.
2362 2018-05-05 01:11:41 #15 takes the win for the pure stocks 25 lap feature
2363 2018-05-05 01:09:38 Then why are they trying to make owners of bump stocks felons?
2364 2018-05-05 01:07:01 Buy all mine Warren!!! I’ve glady sold off...I can find non USA destroyer stocks
2365 2018-05-05 01:04:20 Hello, yes for now, might be have more stocks next week :) we will let you know
2366 2018-05-05 01:04:06 So I guess outlawing bump stocks is out of the question....

2368 2018-05-05 01:02:41 Sally Yates was fired. I

f Trump had kept her on, I am sure Kerry would be in the stocks by now.
2369 2018-05-05 01:02:11 Separate trigger pull for each round. Still semiautomatic however I would be fine with banning these as well as bump stocks.
2370 2018-05-05 01:02:04 Stocks and their workers to 49%, a safer VA. And he’s is looking very little
2371 2018-05-05 01:02:03 wonder what the dowry was? just her or did he also give stocks as well
2372 2018-05-05 01:02:00 Citron accepting a challenge.  @Jimcramer has famously named his dog Nvidia.  If $NVDA is trading over $230 in 12 months, Citron will donate $230k to the Humane Society. $NVDA has become a victim of its own success as competition looms on ALL sides.  Great company. $175 tgt 2018
2373 2018-05-05 01:00:00 This is true -at Cash n Carry -i even asked @hygienix_ph why they don't have stocks there -looks like yun staff don't recognize the soap yet- ADN lang as of now. Good thing nearby  Mercury has some  more #
2374 2018-05-05 00:58:54 Not aware of that.
2375 2018-05-05 00:58:52 As a coach you take anything you can to get an advantage. Illegal stocks are illegal. Not petty to call one out

2383 2018-05-05 00:49:42 The 5J of Steven Jacobs wins the second heat of the Novice Strictly Stocks!
2384 2018-05-05 00:49:03 That is when @realDonaldTrump isn't in a meeting saying something stupid like forget due process, or recommending Queen gun grabber add her bill banning AR-15's into others proposed bills. Already needlessly banned Bump Stocks.  He's your best ally except for when he isn't. @GOP
2385 2018-05-05 00:47:24 NO. Everyone knew EXACTLY what we were getting in Trump left and right. No one cares because no one expected him to be moral. What his base which is 85% college-educated white males wanted was a good economy. Stocks are up & his base is happy.
2386 2018-05-05 00:46:34 $BW good evidence for move to $3.50 short term expectation to cover gap fill. 2 big activist investors took large position. Last two trading sessions promoting confidence. #stocks #avTradeIdeas #trading

2389 2018-05-05 00:45:16 In this case they can eat what they sow & reap, for a very long time!

It also affect soybean and other agricultural product stocks...
2390 2018-05-05 00:42:54 When Americans are close to harvest usda always underplays production and world stocks.
2391 2018-05-05 00:42:16 He is not wrong. Other sources agree. There's a difference between the number of people who own stock in the value of all the stocks owned. Krugman has also won numerous Awards in economics so he can't be that stupid about it.
2392 2018-05-05 00:40:59 Tesla stocks as any other stocks run into wedges patterns. Sometimes you get an upward trend or a downward trend. 
I believe the only thing Tesla can control is manufacture innovative products meeting high quality standards and don’t getting distracted by the noise.

2396 2018-05-05 00:37:38 Come in spinner. Slow US Spring wheat sowings + Poor US Winter Wheat + Questionable Black Sea crop vs Big Global Stocks. USDA WASDE to flip the coin next week. Growers, where are you placing your bets?
2397 2018-05-05 00:35:58 When a foundation’s investment time horizon is basically eternity, it is inexcusable for their assets to be so spectacularly mismanaged by trying to pick stocks and sectors, and not investing for the long haul.
2398 2018-05-05 00:33:46 So did you ban bump stocks,prevent seriously mentally ill people from getting guns,because as soon as you got sworn in you got rid of the mental illness gun ban.The blood is on you.
2399 2018-05-05 00:33:29 The board was forced at the time to get a big name because sponsors were getting restless, stocks were at an all time low and the morale for fans also low also Liverpool had just gotten Klopp and Pep had just signed for the Blue Half. I think Poch would be perfect for you guys.
2400 2018-05-05 00:32:10 4.0 secured, stocks rising, skin glowing. Summer ‘18 show me something real.
2401 2018-05-05 00:29:46 And nothing done about gun control at all not even bump stocks no age increase for buying assault weapons. God doesn't help those that don't help themselves.
2402 2018-05-05 00:27:54 You freakin fool. The #GOP #TaxScamBill didn’t help anyone who is the wealthiest or a corporation! They have bought back stocks instead of investing in their workers! #Trump is so stupid
2403 2018-05-05 00:26:44 For a sec i thought you had stocks in Bacardi. Buy them out and make nick hurty juice an available beverage
2404 2018-05-05 00:26:44 Put me on friend. After I finish this Harvard program I’m going to start dipping my toes in stocks. Already got my foot on crypto. I’m trying to secure long term wealth.
2405 2018-05-05 00:23:52 But he is able to pull the wool over the eyes. Because individual fund contributors do not own the stock. The fund owns the stocks. So it appear that very few own them. While in truth many do.
2406 2018-05-05 00:23:52 Did you ban 'bump stocks'?  Or was that another lie?
2407 2018-05-05 00:23:20 Nope not wanting to disarm just get Bump stocks and assault rifle type weapons off the street - safer for everyone, police included; have you asked law enforcement for an opinion?
2408 2018-05-05 00:22:35 Still no room.
2409 2018-05-05 00:21:54 Nice to hear your not afraid of the NRA, but where was any gun regulation mentioned? Even bump stocks?

2414 2018-05-05 00:18:57 What’s really cool is some online brokers like “Jafx” will allow you to trade cryptocurrencies and some of the major stocks like Apple, google, amazon, Snapchat, Facebook, etc. and with these brokers you are allowed to trade on leverage up to 1:1000. Micro lots like 0.10 +

2419 2018-05-05 00:15:48 No one wants to ‘disarm’ anyone, people want, no assault rifles, no bump stocks, no large magazines and restrictions on gun show sales.
2420 2018-05-05 00:14:09 Hogg must have missed the part where Trump mentioned billions of dollars going to school safety, stricter background checks, mental health checks, and banning bump stocks.

I would like to see stricter gun laws, a ban on military style weapons and bump stocks.

2477 2018-05-04 23:33:35 My husband is a Democrat & he owns 12 guns. Most Dems don't want to give up their guns anymore than Repubs. They just want to keep guns and bump stocks out of the hands of lunatics and law breakers. The NRA sews fear bc they think a few bucks is worth more than our kids lives.
2478 2018-05-04 23:33:23 I'm lucky I live near the Salish Sea and obviously the Pacific and can and have seen them feeding and every time I've seen hundreds to tens of thousands of sea birds feeding too. The greatest threat to fish stocks will never be whales, it will always been illegal fishing
2479 2018-05-04 23:32:15 was stephen paddock a bad guy?  he might have been less bad without all the bump stocks and military style weapons

2481 2018-05-04 23:29:04 Nobody is trying to take away the second amendment! Bump stocks, legal age, and loop holes criminals can use to purchase guns. None of that takes away your right to buy a gun, the moment they want to take all our guns, I'll gladly side with you.

2491 2018-05-04 23:18:40 Yes. They own stocks in the companies, and aren't they exempt from the insider trading prohibitions by which the rest of us must abide?
2492 2018-05-04 23:16:47 TRUMP IS TERRIFIED OF THE NRA.  The only things that scares him more are Putin and Muller.  Trump and the NRA would rather your kids get shot and killed before they even think about banning bump stocks or passing a common-sense law that requires stricter background checks..

2495 2018-05-04 23:10:34 Nobody wants to 'disarm' anyone.  Better background checks, closing loopholes, limiting clip size and eliminating things like bump stocks are a start.  Assault rifles restrictions requires a thorough discussion and debate.

2498 2018-05-04 23:08:05 So has he backpeddaled on banning bump-stocks(and related devices) & his support for the arbitrary seizure of private arms from people who have not been convicted of a crime or confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt to be a threat to themselves or others?
2499 2018-05-04 23:06:01 RT @SenFeinstein: We can stop this uniquely American scourge of gun violence by banning assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks and raising the minimum age to purchase all firearms. The path forward is clear, and the time to act is now. #EnoughIsEnough
2500 2018-05-04 23:05:02 Bump stocks?
2501 2018-05-04 23:04:38 Don’t ban bump stocks.
2502 2018-05-04 23:02:45 How can we have liberty if we don't legalize marijuana--a plant that was given to us by our creator? If we can't ban bump stocks or pass laws requiring stricter background checks, we might as well legalize opiods, doctor-assisted suicide, and abortion.  But Trump opposes these.

2511 2018-05-04 22:52:06 Stocks open lower after US adds fewer than expected jobs. That didn't stop #Trump from bragging abt the jobs report although he did NOT meet expectations. Wages have NOT risen although Trump/Ryan & Reps on t Hill gave corporations a huge tax cut. Their tax con job only helps them

2517 2018-05-04 22:46:07 She said "Doesn't support a ban on bump stocks" Context is important.

I don't see where she said "any restrictions"  

And no, it really doesn't.  The mentally ill is covered in BGCs.  You haven't shown me where they dont support BGCs, which is what I originally argued I believe
2518 2018-05-04 22:43:22 William Larner is quickest in the outlaw pony stocks at 15.498. Randy Kretzinger Jr is the fastest pony stock at 16.221
2519 2018-05-04 22:42:57 now don't get me wrong, we need to prevent overreach.  When they use the dog whistle term of "assault weapon", we know that's a load of crap.  But regulating bump stocks, high capacity magazines, raising the age to 21, are regulations I can live with.
2520 2018-05-04 22:42:47 Daniels is asking ppl to donate for her lawyer and ridiculous show of media. She took the money from Cohen- done! Use that money & invest in stocks or more physical enhancements. This is all a show. Why didn’t past Presidents get this hassle from prostitutes?
2521 2018-05-04 22:41:15 Therein lies the rub. The definition of ‘assault weapon’ is very controversial. I certainly don’t think too many people would argue to keep bump stocks. Not so sure semi- automitics are going anywhere. I would like someway to better track people with mental health issues & report

2527 2018-05-04 22:37:37 RSI is a huge indicator for the larger markets...  I don't rely on RSI much however for penny stocks...  It is not as good of an indicator on the OTC level...  It is useful there, don't get me wrong, but can be very misleading at the penny stock level...
2528 2018-05-04 22:37:05 You're scared of him. You're scared of becoming a supporter. He's fine and dandy you tweeters keep bringing up bad bump stocks against his character. There's got to be some good news having a Billionaire in Hospitality as President.
2529 2018-05-04 22:33:51 it's hilarious how Trump just blurts out crap, like when he said bump stocks were going away. then the NRA calls him up, demands a meeting. the next day and weeks ahead, nothing more about bump stocks.
2530 2018-05-04 22:31:28 Are bump stocks illegal yet?
2531 2018-05-04 22:30:21 blah blah blah, sucking up to the NRA is unbecoming.  Less talk/tweet, get more work done.   Fix DACA, infrastructure, immigration, bump stocks, follow up on companies using their tax cuts as a windfall, hire more border security, upgrade surveillance.
2532 2018-05-04 22:30:01 “There’s this thing called snapchat that doesn’t exist yet, and app where you can post stories and pictures, Tesla and Bitcoin stocks are things you should invest in, the Saints are gonna win the Super Bowl this year, bet money on that, also when you get rich, hire a mercenary

2538 2018-05-04 22:27:20 This is a total lie and misrepresentation of what the Democrats and liberals want. Not trying to disarm anybody other than those unfit mentally and those that cannot pass a background check. Also to strict sales of bump stocks, multiple bullet clips, and assault rifles.
2539 2018-05-04 22:27:06 I believe that bump stocks should be outlawed,and the gun laws need to be revamped!In my opinion minimum age to purchase s/b21 years of age, BUT We recruit our youth at 18 years of age to go to war for us, and by law in our country, those individuals can’t have a beeron USsoil!

2541 2018-05-04 22:26:22 Value trade protectionism

After tumbling from the January high in the first quarter, global stocks were relatively more range bound to start off the second quarter. Global economic growth did see a mild improvement in April according to the J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing …
2542 2018-05-04 22:25:52 I don’t think it’s awesome to give away parts to assault rifles. Especially bump stocks.
2543 2018-05-04 22:25:16 Great companies & stocks never need to be concerned with short sellers. When they start talking about them it is not a good sign
2544 2018-05-04 22:24:50 Drop stocks  and stop buying
2545 2018-05-04 22:24:10 Didn’t Trump suggest banning bump stocks and raising the age of owning a rifle to 21?  Would the @NRA let a Dem that said the exact same thing speak at a convention  #JustSaying
2546 2018-05-04 22:21:50 @acorns is there a way to continue to invest with you without my money going into gun manufacturer stocks?
2547 2018-05-04 22:20:17 Stop dogging my oil stocks
2548 2018-05-04 22:17:01 You shouldn't have banned bump stocks.
2549 2018-05-04 22:16:29 Yusuf, lives on Temple Canyon with wife.

Put all their savings into habanero stocks. Can't retire.
2550 2018-05-04 22:15:35 What happened to your bravado on banning bump stocks and raising minimum age to 21? I know lunch with the NRA and who knows what else was promised to you is that it took. So the charade at the WH with Parkland students, parents and Sandy Hook families was just a photo op!
2551 2018-05-04 22:14:43 And it's nothing about "guilt" - institutions already withhold taxes on foreign stocks one holds, automatically.
2552 2018-05-04 22:13:41 it’s race day babyyy  wishing my baby brother the best of luck as he starts racing Street Stocks tonight. y’all better watch out. 
2553 2018-05-04 22:13:37 Can you please explain further, reason behind all stocks growing 40% in earnings, but not in price. While 20% or less doubled in last few quarters. What was going with all of them.
2554 2018-05-04 22:13:19 You can't be serious, @garymasonglobe! If you aren't already, you might want to think about investing heavily in cryptocurrency and cannabis stocks -- should help accelerate your desire to decrease your wealth! 
2555 2018-05-04 22:12:50 There's a 18% spread between how consumer staples have performed and tech stocks in 2018. $XLP $XLK

2557 2018-05-04 22:11:21 @jack great job on the entire Twitter platform. Stocks are up,  mistakes are being corrected and social media is being revolutionized.
2558 2018-05-04 22:11:12 Single payer would reduce corruption. Medical device and drug companies and providers would negotiate with career executive branch officials subject to financial conflict of interest laws. Today Members of Congress micromanage healthcare. Some own stocks in these same companies!
2559 2018-05-04 22:10:56 Bold faced lie. Dems wanted place sensible restrictions like bump stocks. You are truly the Lier In Chief. Sad. #LockHimUp #25thAmendmentNow
2560 2018-05-04 22:09:20 Quote from interview with Buffet "He largely avoided newer tech stocks such as Amazon and Google because he didn't fully appreciate their value."  And now we must believe his opinion about cryptos?

2563 2018-05-04 22:07:10 You’re just lying out of your ass!  What happened to “I’m going to put an end to bump stocks”?? You say whatever the crowd in front of you at the time wants to hear. This isn’t a tv show! Either do your f’n job or resign!
2564 2018-05-04 22:07:04 Look I'm really annoyed..The President is having a detrimental effect on stocks and share dealing..please can he stop worrying about crime in London and Loose Women and be more convincing on the economy!
2565 2018-05-04 22:06:53 Still way better than many of the other stocks getting pumped
2566 2018-05-04 22:06:36 This ass-hat has never fired a gun EVER!
2567 2018-05-04 22:05:33 geez what a selection though! Noe the growth makes sense. used to purchase individual sticks but sold them all and bought my index funds. Going for the Warren buffet approach on this! 

IIRC the only exposure I have to your stocks albeit limited is through the s&p500
2568 2018-05-04 22:05:02 So why did you ban bump stocks, traitor?
2569 2018-05-04 22:03:47 I know you don’t care because I’m just one person but definitely gonna unfollow soon. You have such a bearish bias that is so uninviting to witness. You should have an open mind to either way and how you would react, but you don’t even act like there’s a chance stocks can go up.

2575 2018-05-04 22:00:38 For sure on all accounts. My main stocks have been AAPL, TSLA, AMZN, FB, GOOG. I just bought in 2010ish and kept adding more and more over the years. So far it's been great!
2576 2018-05-04 22:00:24 It's twitter mate, volatile is a word for stocks and shares. Don't get mad just because your buddy has been clowned on near enough everything he's said whilst  fetishizing a grumpy trophyless italian homophobe with a nicotine addiction
2577 2018-05-04 22:00:22 Don't take our pump stocks away. "Shall not be infringed." The Founding Fathers put those words in the 2A for a very specific reason.
2578 2018-05-04 21:59:09 With all those NRA members in one place I will be expecting mass murder, puppy drowning,  monkey teasing & random cowboy style shootouts. 
Those NRA ppl are nothing but terrorist with mullets and "assault weapons" fitted with "bump stocks" & "silencers".

2580 2018-05-04 21:59:00 @IGClientHelp Hi, I would like to know if you provide CFD for U.S. small cap stocks like CREG, CLWT , IMTE or BOXL on the short side for this past week. They've been extremely active and volatile. Thank you for any informatioN!
2581 2018-05-04 21:57:44 @EveningEdit I hope John Layfield does more research on his stocks then he did on the conversation he would have with Stacy Washington as he showed no knowledge and then put in his two cents regarding gun rights
2582 2018-05-04 21:56:39 Also the record high that trump broke in the stocks was an Obama record I believe, feel free to correct me if I’m wrong. Please continue with the results
2583 2018-05-04 21:55:05 Getting NRA to take a strong public stand against bump stocks and support regulation of them was an act of friendship to gun owners and the public.  @POTUS 's act aroused ire among many pro-gun voters and took courage. It was one of his better moments.
2584 2018-05-04 21:54:57 Since you compared Obama’s to Trump in stocks then Obama gets credit for pulling us out of the Great Recession and reducing unemployment from 10% to under 5%. More people working more taxes getting paid. How many jobs can be specifically tied to the tax cut?
2585 2018-05-04 21:53:37 I hope you’re right. I cashed in a fair amount of stocks anticipating this downturn
2586 2018-05-04 21:52:37 So I guess your in stocks for the long hold huh. 
2587 2018-05-04 21:52:10 The conflict of interest statute, 18 USC 208, technically does not apply to President Trump or Members of Congress. But they still should sell stocks that create conflicts. When some do not (e.g. Tom Price and his health care stocks) it’s that much harder to go after Trump.
2588 2018-05-04 21:50:18 "Sacconaghi and I have both spent the better part of the last three decades analyzing stocks, and when you hear such a pat answer to a pertinent question, it's a huge red flag."  Real!
2589 2018-05-04 21:49:53 I then did much the same thing with Amazon.

I did all of this while watching people like Jim Cramer pump stocks he was hoping to offload, and dump on stocks he wanted to buy.
2590 2018-05-04 21:49:47 Hey @ValerieJarrett your likes said stocks will tank if @realDonaldTrump wins..So???Even liberal economists R giving credit to trump tax cuts & getting rid of regulation.& pls contact me cause I can’t get or afford health insurance & trump will actually earn the Nobel
2591 2018-05-04 21:48:01 Evening Market Weap-up: stocks closed higher after Jobs report as Apple led tech stocks. S&P found support at 200ema and closed with a Caution at upper resistance.
2592 2018-05-04 21:47:58 The conflict of interest statute, 18 USC 208, technically does not apply to President Trump or Members of Congress. But they still should sell stocks that create conflicts. When some do not (e.g. Tom Price and his health care stocks) it’s that much harder to go after Trump.

2594 2018-05-04 21:47:14 They already have background checks. He’s out billions into school safety, stricter background checks, and mental health checks. He banned bump stocks. Confiscating weapons will start a civil war guaranteed.
2595 2018-05-04 21:44:21 @OptionsAction would it be good idea to buy sprint stock with the T-Mobile sprint deal being in the works? Or better to buy T-Mobile USA stocks?
2596 2018-05-04 21:43:45 Great analysis, EXCEPT $XLP (especially $KHC) were down so much question is: IS this Year 2000? Are people selling staples to buy #FAANG stocks?
2597 2018-05-04 21:43:31 It’s OVER after this Drop #SippAndListen stocks going up! THIS #HeavyMentalWorldTour SHIT Stupid above anything I’ve designed!
2598 2018-05-04 21:42:58 Bump stocks, age limits, take the guns first due process later.
2599 2018-05-04 21:42:32 As long as we do it with nra-approved rifle stocks, right? Hypocrites.
2600 2018-05-04 21:40:54 He never said he would take on the NRA. He said there’s things they can work with like bump stocks etc to make people safer. You guys are terrible propagandists as in not being very good at it. You parrot the msm narrative word for word. It’s comedy.
2601 2018-05-04 21:40:24 I’ve heard stocks are the best!

2603 2018-05-04 21:38:58 You can find lots of examples in smaller stocks. The point is size factor matters. By the time it was 20% off ATHs, $SUNE was a third $TSLA's market cap and below the $20B threshold mentioned.

2621 2018-05-04 21:28:32 Yes, this is a major concern of mine about whether tokens can have enduring non-zero price, and @multicoincap seems to agree. The simple counterexample is any monopoly (patents a subset). Consider also all property registries (real estate title, NASDAQ stocks, domain names...)
2622 2018-05-04 21:28:28 Hey Spanky, what happened to all the things you promised all the parents of the Fla. massacre? You didn't mention anything about less rounds in magazine, no bump stocks, international background checks, no further manufacturing of assault weapons for sale in the US to name a few
2623 2018-05-04 21:27:23 Yes top ten all classy stocks. Next twenty not bad either
2624 2018-05-04 21:27:19 Wich platform You used to trade OTC stocks?
2625 2018-05-04 21:25:38 I know this is bad but I drank contaminated water by accident a few days ago and I've never been so shredded looking
Possibly the best "detox/Cleanse" product on the market and its free on tap, get it while stocks last
Contaminated water > Skinny tea
2626 2018-05-04 21:25:04 The NRA protects the Second Amendment...except when they're compromising parts of it away like pushing for a regulatory ban on bump stocks and pushing FixNICS.
2627 2018-05-04 21:24:57 Parma sells products that kill about 5 times as many people each year. Why isn’t there a push to ban those stocks?  Car companies make vehicles and people drink and drive each year and kill thousands.
2628 2018-05-04 21:24:40 *except for bump stocks
2629 2018-05-04 21:23:58 Great day on the market. All indexes up. #jobs #report didn't hurt the stocks as I thought.
2630 2018-05-04 21:22:05 Yeah it's absurd. Bump stocks were a loophole EVERYONE knew would be banned, it's driving people to more serious gun reform positions. One of the worst imo is bush removing 3 day waiting period, purely political move, the entire purpose was to reduce suicide and murder/suicide
2631 2018-05-04 21:21:56 You are late my friend, you should have bought some stocks of forest companies, a while ago.
2632 2018-05-04 21:20:49 Bro you know I’m not talking about stocks, I’m talking about culturally relevant, nobody gave a fuck about aidas until kanye came out with the Yeezy and made the boost popular, adidas themselves admitted he had a huge impact on shoe sales.
2633 2018-05-04 21:19:09 I bought AMZN at an all time high and it's doubled since.   There's generally a good story behind stocks hitting all time highs.
2634 2018-05-04 21:17:17 Holy fucking unrecognized capital gains, Batman! I made 2% on the stocks today!

2636 2018-05-04 21:16:42 How did a genuine remark about Tesla stocks and Tesla's future turn into a anti-woman shouting tantrum? I left Facebook because of all the negativity, but i see some of those people moved to Twitter...
2637 2018-05-04 21:16:36 Dear @elonmusk,

Tesla stocks fall down. Why??
2638 2018-05-04 21:15:40 Stocks do the same thing. But are a lot more consistent with their value.
2639 2018-05-04 21:15:05 This is one of those times I am glad Hubs does not have Twitter. He stocks up on lots of things at that same farm goods store.

2643 2018-05-04 21:09:50 @kenklukowski I suggest a good class in physics and mechanics regarding bump stocks. You may disagree with @GunOwners on the legality of regulations, but you can't ignore what the device actually does. It's intellectually dishonest to say it converts a rifle to full auto.
2644 2018-05-04 21:09:13 When I was in college I put my money in a mutual fund that paid my student debt off 1 year before college. That was before crypto though. I’ll always have a portfolio of traditional stocks.

2648 2018-05-04 21:07:42 Sorry been waiting...not seeing it...tax bill a farce, stocks down, trade is lowest ever, farmers and ranchers are paying the biggest price right now. When does it get good?
2649 2018-05-04 21:07:39 Probably not...while I agree we need a group lobbying for the people the NRA needs to reevaluate what the meaning of shall not be infringed and stop slowly giving up pieces of our rights....machine guns (nra) bump stocks (nra) background checks (nra)
2650 2018-05-04 21:07:18 I'm obsessed with hyperbolic weather warnings and condescendingly laugh at everyone who stocks up on water during a snow warning but as soon as the word "thunder" is involved, I'm like "CHARGE THE BATTERIES. SEAL THE EXITS." #onstorm
2651 2018-05-04 21:06:35 Yes the stocks would go up and her husband’s hedge fund  would go up
2652 2018-05-04 21:05:44 What part of nobody is trying to take guns away from you do .... Unless you are a murderous psychopath that wants to buy assault weapons, bump stocks and silencers.  If you have problem with any of those you are part of problem. If you don’t you have nothing to worry about.

2677 2018-05-04 20:59:23 He’s Stirring up the less intelligent again. No one is trying to take your guns away. They want mandatory thorough background checks on all gun sales & ban on bump stocks & assault rifles.

2680 2018-05-04 20:58:17 Common sense?? Banning freatures of a rifle because they look mean.... hand grips, stocks and fore grips. That’s plain stupid!!!

2688 2018-05-04 20:54:50 La fast fashion tel Zara produit des collections courtes et donc avec peu de stock...et un réassort en Tunisie, Espagne ou Maroc. Cette mesure est de la poudre aux yeux pas efficace car elles géreront autrement leurs stocks.

2689 2018-05-04 20:54:00 Yeah...that’s probably true, but why are you talking about lawyers? I’m pointing out the science that fish stocks are in decline.
2690 2018-05-04 20:53:44 Real estate or stocks?
2691 2018-05-04 20:53:29 Bought $TSLA on the “bad” earnings call and $FB on Zuck in senate. Contrarian moves for sure. #stocks #fintweet
2692 2018-05-04 20:53:17 Also, the whole premise of the article shows faulty understanding of shorts and mkts. Shorted stocks . . . Go Down.  Tuns out shorted stocks underperform benchmarks over all longer-term time periods.  There’s like, statistics on this.

But short squeeze sounds so juicy.

2696 2018-05-04 20:52:40 The best returns are AFTER people lose their job, panic about money and then sell their stocks... This time people have sold their stocks fearing another bear  in advance.  Times always change.

2698 2018-05-04 20:50:43 So, he's not bypassing Congress to create law via DOJ/ATF in regards to bump stocks as machineguns? Yeah, those same bump stocks that the ATF under OBAMA declared TWICE to not be machineguns?

I'd hate to see what it was like if he stood against the Constitution and the 2nd.
2699 2018-05-04 20:48:02 Looking forward to you banning bump stocks, as you said you would do through executive order. You didn't forget, did you?
2700 2018-05-04 20:47:40 Hoping Trump can ban bump stocks, not much has happened since March, when “Attorney General Sessions announced the Department of Justice will soon start accepting public comments on a proposed rule to define machine gun to include bump stock devices... effectively banning them”

I am also Canadian but perhaps U should be worrying about what's happening up there! Trudeau is a disaster!
2703 2018-05-04 20:45:45  @realDonaldTrump signs #Omnibus2018 which included legislation banning bump stocks & other assorted bullshit anti #2A legislation. Don’t kid yourself. The White House doesn’t care about the #2A 
2704 2018-05-04 20:45:42 Would like to see Cannabis stocks that a small, tiny investor can try.
2705 2018-05-04 20:45:34 Hmm. Do u think that deep discount on oil stocks might be warranted? U kno, seeingis running fromfaster than a cheetah thanks to #NDP #Socialism #NoPipeline attitude? Unless you’re thinking of holding until Nov 2019; alot ofoil CO’s have been racking up debt to survive
2706 2018-05-04 20:45:24 Just reading the reviews for brokers on the site much appreciated. How is venom trading for shorting stocks and locating them? Are they above average with a wide range of the under 10 dollar penny stocks to chose from?... Thanks Mike

2711 2018-05-04 20:44:34 They weren't waiting for that to happen, it just happened.  Plus they initially announced it before the NA stocks were confirmed sold out
2712 2018-05-04 20:44:25 Some things I know:

Here on earth, future stock prices cannot be predicted accurately. 

Making money every single day trading stocks is impossible. 

Nobody knows the reason behind single day SPX moves, yet everyone thinks they do.

$AAPL +4% on $BRK.b buys

All sectors finish higher
2717 2018-05-04 20:40:41 It’s about stupidity. Guns owners need rules and regulations that fit into our society. I’m not talking about taking away guns. Bump stocks, assault weapons?  Come on, our kids are being killed.
2718 2018-05-04 20:40:25 Except for bump stocks and age limits on rifles and stuff..... Totally safe.

2735 2018-05-04 20:33:51 No, I’ve been working a minimum wage job since I was 14, my parents gave me no money to invest in stocks. I’m just very good at saving. And when I opened the accounts, who else but Mr. Trump was already in office?
2736 2018-05-04 20:33:42 Has the internet with its instant info, & fast trading, made people believe they should hold stocks for less time & expect fast results? I'm a buy and hold kinda guy, but just wondered.

2743 2018-05-04 20:29:08 Most voters don’t understand what the EU does. They also don’t understand that the fishing industry problems result from a collapse in fish stocks after historic overfishing. If we drop EU quotas we will still be restricted to fish only what is sustainable.

2788 2018-05-04 20:01:19 How to make money in stocks per Will Rogers:
1. Buy stock
2. When it goes up, sell it
3. If it goes down don’t buy it in the first place

See? Easy!
2789 2018-05-04 20:01:05 @CNBCClosingBell When they trash talk a company because they make money it's time too do research on them & figure out who in that sector is going to lose, it's always better owning stocks than employing people @SenSanders teaches,  knowing how too play the game or use the news

2810 2018-05-04 19:45:28 Today, Trump spoke at the #NRAConvention in Dallas and failed to mention his plans to ban bump stocks and assault style weapons. Its obvious, he wishes to supporter his #NRAmember to have their right to kill as many people as possible, with a militarized arsenal. #GunsKillPeople
2811 2018-05-04 19:45:24 Exacto. Dujovne no sabe donde esta parado y la manera en que lo arreglaron es transitoria.

2823 2018-05-04 19:39:06 OK, sure. 

BTC price will increase as long as mining bitcoin is more productive than alternative opportunities, which for many reasons I've stated previously in this thread will be true for a long, long time. A time during which buying stocks will continue to lose relevance.

2833 2018-05-04 19:32:53 How many gun deaths were committed by people under 21, with assault weapons (whatever that is) and who used bump stocks?  By the way, what is an "assault weapon"?
2834 2018-05-04 19:32:51 SB1346 by @NancySkinnerCA moved to the Assembly.  This stupid bill makes illegal bump stocks illegal. 

CA progressive politics at its best.
2835 2018-05-04 19:32:29 1.  When the unemployment rate is low, with more folks finding jobs (like today), stocks tend to bring in terrible returns going forward. 
2.  When the unemployment rate is high, stocks tend to bring in great returns going forward
2836 2018-05-04 19:32:25 What is an assault weapon? What is a high-capacity magazine? Nobody cares about the bump stocks. I think you have a real problem with the minimum age, since the military will continue to want 18-year-olds.

2845 2018-05-04 19:28:58 More guns is not the answer!!!  We need smart, sensible gun control!!  Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines & bump stocks!!!  Universal background checks are a must!!!!  Do this & we’ll be a safer society!

2847 2018-05-04 19:28:10 If Donald Trump wanted to regain the trust of pro-gun absolutists, he would have reversed his position on Bump Stocks and Fix-NICS in his speech.
2848 2018-05-04 19:27:35 Yeah, but it’s a blanket statement. Among the many joys of photography - especially analogue photography - is the variety of choices we make all the time with film stocks and techniques. Relying on extreme overexposure is certainly a crutch, and discounts the options available.
2849 2018-05-04 19:26:57 2/2 - Personally I don’t necessarily support banning a particular type of gun. I do support more stringent background checks, longer waiting periods, closing gun show loopholes, banning bump-stocks & high capacity mags. It shouldn’t be easier to get a gun than a driver’s license.
2850 2018-05-04 19:26:25 @Greatstockpix dont understand the reasons for the 100% 200% 300% gains in some stocks lately, why is this, why for a long time you rarely seen 100% and now just nuts. Just seems odd and I cant figure out the true reason.

Repeal the Dickey Amendment, ban bump stocks, tighten background checks. Do something that actually helps.
2873 2018-05-04 19:18:05 With the exception of bump stocks (approved for sale without regulation by the Obama administration in 2010), you have been saying exactly the same thing for thirty years.

2875 2018-05-04 19:16:43 Given that altcoins are the new penny stocks, does it make sense to put more than 10% of your portfolio on them? Most rely on the main chains to go mainstream in the first place.

2900 2018-05-04 19:05:11 Yes. Good results are built into the valuations of many companies. Any surprise on negative front, and many stocks can correct. One always have to be stock specific, though. And hunt for value. Which, of course, is getting more and more difficult.

2974 2018-05-04 18:31:09 The macro outlook is fine. And when that’s the case, stocks tend go up without an exogenous shock. Too many get taken down by overthinking.

2984 2018-05-04 18:27:07 Sure. Trump’s ATF is implementing a “rate increasing device” ban to ban bump stocks. Language is so vaugue it would allow any future anti gun administration to ban anything they think would increase the rate of fire of a gun, including custom triggers and “high cap” magazines.

3003 2018-05-04 18:14:20 OTC stocks are going to hit highs,RSIs need to cool, if u know charts, & you are in a good transparent play, w Co updates pretty steady, then there are many ops to buy low and sell high, and rebuy after finds bottom. Again, this is based on No Dilution, or even at end of Dilution
3004 2018-05-04 18:14:13 Which kind of stocks do you trade?

3007 2018-05-04 18:11:30 Many OTC stocks are Shells.  Empty Shells do have value.  Its a strange world, mostly we buy on spec, but real runs are due usually to RMs or Revenue, or Big news connecting Big Names- Many Reasons. Got to weed thru the muck in 000 land. Do DD and know Charts!
3008 2018-05-04 18:11:00 And when the economy plummets they loose all the stocks and investments and end up living off social security.  Different path, same destination.
3009 2018-05-04 18:10:56 A whopping 77% of S&P stocks have beaten earnings...yet this market can’t seem to sustain a rally.

3010 2018-05-04 18:09:39 Its all complicated.  Much to know, but money can be made.  Need Stocks that actually warrant buying and holding.  000 world looking better cuz so many were beat down by dilution and are actually under valued! :-) GLTA

3044 2018-05-04 17:48:26 Why does it matter? The ‘experts’ all recommended people to sell 
#stocks and buy #gold if #Trump won. Clearly that wasn’t a good idea. Why would they be correct with their predictions now?
3045 2018-05-04 17:47:59 The question is: who will consume this marijuana that companies are rushing to produce? Is there a hope to get more people consume weed? On what basis? 

if we cannot answer these questions, these stocks are a big gamble.

3052 2018-05-04 17:43:20 My biggest learning curve has been holding onto (the wrong) stocks too long only to average down in the "hopes" of it coming back. I am still making mistakes but feel as if it is all my process in becoming a better trader. The only downfall here is that mistakes =real losses.
3053 2018-05-04 17:42:31 Unemployment at record lows, stocks broke 17 national records, trade increased more in shorter period of time than b4, more tax breaks than #Reagan admin, possible peace deal with/N Korea..Specific things that did NOT happen b4 a depression. #PresidentTrump #Trump #ThxANONEcon

3069 2018-05-04 17:31:36 That makes sense, Canada & Australia are very similar. I have no idea why America rarely looks at other countries to try & fix some of their problems. In Ontario there is a college of teachers & they invest in a lot of stocks & businesses. That’s why we have secure benefits.

3103 2018-05-04 17:17:22 Highway traffic is like day trading stocks. When you see the lane beside you speed up, your emotional response is to change lanes. Similarly, a trader wants to enter a position after a stock pumps. The rational decision is to do nothing but human psyche is a tricky thing.

3105 2018-05-04 17:16:22 The way I understand it, purchasing power is all that matters. Call hodling what you want, as long as it increases in purchasing power faster than an alternative (like hodling / trading stocks), it is a more successful strategy and therefore more relevant.

3107 2018-05-04 17:12:15 Thanks, but that’s not what I’m seeing here. I’m seeing algorithmic trading treating stocks like a commodity. They hunt & run stops in both directions when positioning gets too offsides.

3111 2018-05-04 17:10:54 The case to be short-term bullish in the US seems strong:

-Stocks > 10 and 12-month moving averages (but not by too much)
-Earnings spike + stagnant market = 10%+ reduced valuations vs year-end
-Declining unemployment trend intact
-Declining / steep VIX term structure

But, hey, consensus is bearish for sure  #FridayFeeling
3115 2018-05-04 17:10:02 Is it possible that one day we don´t have to rely on experts to handle our money on Wall Street in the same way we don´t need someone to represent us on politics like on your idea for Mars government? ;) Well played, gave us the opportunity to buy more stocks from those clowns.

3120 2018-05-04 17:07:56 Never ceases to amaze when respected co’s like #Bloomberg write articles that label stocks that pay a 4% dividend “exciting”, yet then label #Bitcoin as “languishing in a #crypto-limbo” bc $BTC is now only up 1000% in the last yr as opposed to the 2,000% it was just up?
3121 2018-05-04 17:07:51 The penny stock market is hot! I’ve never seen so many stocks crash 50%+ the same day. This bear market is amazing, it won’t last forever so adapt now and take full advantage of it
3122 2018-05-04 17:05:55 Are you paying attention to the billionaires in America? They are cashing in stocks and buying gold and several have warned you that a crash is on the way and will be worse than the Great Depression. You keep believing and living the dream that will end with a big bang.

3131 2018-05-04 17:01:12 Eventually.  As Graham said, “In the short term the stock market is a voting machine.  In the long-term a weighing machine.”  That applies to the market and single stocks separately and well.
3132 2018-05-04 17:00:54 Stocks are cool, it’s basically your money in a company that hold onto it and if they do good you get money for letting them use yours.  Of course if they do bad then you end up losing money but it’s your money you can back out at any time.
3133 2018-05-04 17:00:14 U.S. stocks rose today, with major indexes shaking off an early  decline as technology stocks gained and overshadowed both an April jobs report that was below expectations and uncertainty over trade talks between the U.S. and China

3170 2018-05-04 16:41:11 I had to step out, and noticed I missed a good buy of $BABA over 182.  I have position in my ROTH, but would've been nice for a day trade.  I should've watched this for reversal off EPS beat.  See many posting on it in my twitter feed.  Congrats to you all.  #Stocks #Trading
3171 2018-05-04 16:40:42 Thank you, Sir for your kinds words of appreciation! I will think about writing on Indian stocks. :) Always open to conversations.

3180 2018-05-04 16:35:30 Can I short the bank? Do the investing principles apply to real estate as it does to stocks 90/10 and all? Am I competent enough to do this?
3181 2018-05-04 16:35:21 Oil prices jump another 2%. The question remains, if @realdonaldtrump realizes that he does alot of damage to his people. Higher prices for oil usually means lesser spending what will bring stocks down. This could end in a bear market.
3182 2018-05-04 16:35:20 thank you for this wonderful piece .. $KKR..

3189 2018-05-04 16:32:40 1/2 Which (or is it WITCH?)  Trump is going to show up today at the NRA Event... I mean you ARE getting paid AND getting campaign funding from today's speech...right? Is it the Trump who said he was "writing out and getting rid of bump stocks" and didn't "care if Congress agreed"
3190 2018-05-04 16:32:33 I love that there is just so much to learn about stocks
3191 2018-05-04 16:32:13 still my question remains, how do u know that there were 0 stocks....
just because u were not able to buy in flash sale doesn't means that there was no stock.. and they way u reply to any comment, clearly shows who is who here..
3192 2018-05-04 16:31:53 I'm not surprised the Xiaomi is up there. The stores where I work, stocks are gone within 2 weeks.
3193 2018-05-04 16:31:48 The NRA spent zero dollars to elect Obama. Obama did nothing on guns and his ATF ok’d bump stocks. Trump signed an EO to regulate them. They should ask for a refund.
3194 2018-05-04 16:31:22 .@SpeakerRyan really?  Where's all the money pouring into people's wages that you promised?   Company's too busy buying back stocks? #GOPTaxScam

3197 2018-05-04 16:30:36 I actually support the 2nd amendment. I don't support bump stocks, silencers, armed teachers, mentally ill having access to guns, or the failure of "responsible "gun owners to keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them.
3198 2018-05-04 16:30:35 Bonuses arent raises.....the tax cuts were used to buy back stocks and artificially inflate the markets and economy. All smoke and mirrors until the next bubble and then they will blame the next dem admin. It is in the republican playbook

3201 2018-05-04 16:29:55 The network that told the world to hold their bank stocks as the worst financial meltdown took place since the great depression is playing moralizer... Maybe stick with telling people to just buy the top prefaced by: "This isn't financial advice"

3208 2018-05-04 16:27:34 But how much of their own stocks have they bought back with your gift? And the other corporations? What have they done for the workers? Oh - and don't forget that you screwed the soybean farmers.

3218 2018-05-04 16:23:25 #AskHalftime: Why do you keep saying Energy stocks lag oil prices?
Energy hit its FOURTH BOTTOM in 3 years in Aug 2017. So the lag was entirely cause investors cannot trust oil prices. By refusing to discount, you are driving a bogus bubble right when the next drop is coming.

3226 2018-05-04 16:20:23 History is replete with times in which economy and stocks had virtually no relationship. Don't know why so many focus on the economy when at best it has something like a .16 correlation
3227 2018-05-04 16:19:55 Also only 46% of S&P500 stocks are above their 200 dma

3229 2018-05-04 16:19:10 I’m proud to own 3 shares of TSLA. I’m excited for the vision of the future @elonmusk has drawn, and though I don’t own a Tesla yet (I own a LEAF) I am planning on buying in the future. When SPACEX goes public, I’ll buy those stocks too!
3230 2018-05-04 16:18:10 5/8/16 The Atlantic predicted Trumponomics would plunge US into recession, 10/31/16 NYT US & EU will go into banking crisis, 11/1/16 CNBC Clinton wins Stocks up 3% DJT stock sell off of 10%, etc, etc.  DJT has defied "experts" & economy thriving, still no credit.  Pathetic.

3262 2018-05-04 16:04:56 I didn't make myself clear. I was not trying to argue that nobody want or should invest. Just that a share of what is now considered "investment" in stocks is just an attempt at inflation-flight.

3277 2018-05-04 15:59:21 completely agree :)
3278 2018-05-04 15:58:51 To credit, the stocks did plunge (and corrected themselves). The stock market is a horrible measuring stick for one's presidency, as it isn't all-inclusive to what the economy consists of. The actions we're currently seeing could very well result in another Great Depression.

3300 2018-05-04 15:49:29 It always takes Warren Buffett to remind us not everything out there is bad and stocks are still pieces of real businesses, not just price points on a chart. #BerkshireHathaway
3301 2018-05-04 15:49:02 Thankfully i listened to you and added more position at 158 and at 161. But somehow I was not convinced with tsla.. For me that evaluation never made any sense.
3302 2018-05-04 15:48:52 they’re talking about stocks in class and i instantly thought of trent  @T_DiGiulio5
3303 2018-05-04 15:48:50 I should ask a question of course, might be stupid, but y wud a mgmt like Tata corner shareholder much n lose so much of public trust,When a piece meal2 sharholders might vastly re rate the stock price fter all majority of the stocks are with Tata wont dey want2 see larger mcap?

3314 2018-05-04 15:43:59 I'm not against someone owning a handgun or rifle. No private citizen needs an AK-47 and bump stocks. Those should be reserved for the police and military. I agree with @GilpinPeri horse shit....

3320 2018-05-04 15:41:34 The reason is you are not only investing in best stocks and funds, you are investing in above average and average stocks and funds
3321 2018-05-04 15:41:06 11. There is no such thing as too much diversification- Diversification is needed. A well-diversified portfolio can be created with 10 stocks or three mutual funds. Having more than 20 stocks or six mutual funds can dilute your returns.

3327 2018-05-04 15:40:35 aww, my broken win condition that ends stocks at 30 when it does work didn’t work this time, my character sucks :(((((((((
3328 2018-05-04 15:39:50 No, it was increasing for 107 months until February. Since, February it PLUMMETED almost 3000 points. Everyone has lost a lot of money since then. This has been a horrible year for stocks and 401ks.

3330 2018-05-04 15:39:46 I invested $100 into stocks 2 days ago and I’m already up $2 can’t really fuck with that 9-5 shit 
3331 2018-05-04 15:39:24 One of the reasons is that these stocks have already given a decent return in the past and have a higher base. Secondly, such stocks are widely covered by a number of analysts. As a result, the ability to generate excess returns is severely limited
3332 2018-05-04 15:39:00 Still baffled as to why #TSLA is one of the most shorted stocks on the market.
3333 2018-05-04 15:38:48 8. Large cap stocks are sure bets- While companies with a long track record and an established business make for attractive investments, they may not turn out to be fast appreciating stocks.
3334 2018-05-04 15:38:46 Expectations matter...  Stocks prices aren’t simply relative to competition.

3361 2018-05-04 15:27:41 Stocks are continuing their rebound this morning, as they trade in positive territory (DOW is up over 200 thus far).  MBS started in positive territory (up 9bps), but has withdrawn down 2bps now.  Yields are still hanging at 2.95%.  The low Avg Hourly Wages helped with inflation.
3362 2018-05-04 15:26:46 It is hard. Every shortseller has this pain and it's definitely a barrier to entry when you first start out. Best advice is to save your preborrows for stocks that have A LOT of meat so that there is less chance of you wasting your locate. CREG was up from 1.50. Lots of meat.
3363 2018-05-04 15:26:45 Stocks are fairly valued. Invest in quality companies. You'll be fine.
3364 2018-05-04 15:26:17 It is ON.  Will it change the narrative for more than a day?  Will we sell off into close for fear of news out of China meeting?  Or do we keep going because Monday morning we will hear from Buffet how it's a good time to buy stocks (does he say anything else, ever?)

3410 2018-05-04 15:07:49 I agree. We are just speculating,  no body knows what's going to happen. We are not even sure if it will be just indices or stocks as well.

3418 2018-05-04 15:05:11 Also it is propaganda. They don't want people to know they are in a panic. One of their manufacturer members, the one that makes the bump stocks, went out of business. Major retailers are either no longer selling guns or they've restricted sales.

3431 2018-05-04 14:58:46 GE: No real signal here, just following stocks. The NFP # wasn't great, but wasn't enough to change current sentiment either. Pretty tight range last few weeks. Looks like a stone skipping off the water surface. #eurodollars #STIR

3433 2018-05-04 14:57:36 Obamas government had it easier, growth from an economy's rock bottom isn't as hard as growing from the top. Stocks grow fast after a recession is over too, this had nothing to do with Obama

3443 2018-05-04 14:54:21 Some were worried about an AMZN H&S. Then it surged to ATHs. Then some were worried about an island reversal. And it won’t go down any further. As I’ve been saying for a while, these patterns don’t seem to matter anymore on the stocks that rule the market.

3446 2018-05-04 14:53:53 The stock market is doing well because companies are buying back their own stocks, keeping their value artificially high.  Not that I want the stock market to crash, but it will be impossible for that to continue.

3464 2018-05-04 14:47:09 Stocks in full rally mode led by Apple and Tesla. Good employment number. But not too good. Is exactly what we needed.  Buffett buying a ton of Apple and Tesla rebounding on the reality the company is back in track. $aapl $tsla #model3
3465 2018-05-04 14:47:07 How do you buy now?  Often stocks bought after rip like this from Buffet news, it was wrong time.  Is it not better to wait for party to cool off even if buying for 10 year hold?
3466 2018-05-04 14:47:07 Not sure WHERE u r getting ur "facts?". Real Point: No matter if u claim u r a Dem, a Republican, Green Party, Independent u can still take advantage of G.S. loopholes, lame/no backround chks, assault weaponry of war on streets, bump stocks, allowing guns on college campuses,etc.
3467 2018-05-04 14:46:46 Stocks go up when earnings go up. That means jobs.

3470 2018-05-04 14:45:48 The stock market which is down btw, has nothing to do with normal people's lives, just people who have stocks. Health care is more expensive and restrictive, environment is worse, USA more isolated, racist and immoral. Russia  and China defeating us in cyber and tech wars. #MAGA
3471 2018-05-04 14:45:10 Then why isn’t the NRA lobbying for that? Their only purpose is to make sure no additional sensible reforms are made.  Why did they push to allow guns for the mentally ill and push to stop the ban on bump stocks?  It’s not about gun safety for them.

Here’s a new scenario—from Mutual Fund Land, tho I’ve never seen it in stocks: you sign up to receive dividends…
3547 2018-05-04 14:19:54 This trend Started under Obama. Many of the corporations were supposed to use money to hire people are just buying back their own stocks. You need to look into this. Your tax cut is bad.
3548 2018-05-04 14:19:43 As long as it only creates moderate inflation (as opposed to rampant inflation), it’s bullish for both stocks and bonds, but more so for stocks since even moderate inflation eats away at the return from a bond.

3550 2018-05-04 14:19:15 84% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. Yes, stocks are important and have other effects on the economy. But acting like the stock market crashing repeatedly is caused by low U3 or that low stock prices are per se worse than high U3 seems like a bad argument
3551 2018-05-04 14:18:40 I see nice stocks when they hit bottom on 5 minutes chart this morning are:
$NVDA

Don’t chase them and wait for bottom again

3556 2018-05-04 14:17:12 Like most humans, those reporters and analysts think (and are capable of only thinking) linearly.

3568 2018-05-04 14:13:45 The idea of Smash Switch having the function to be able to switch your character between stocks is actually really interesting. I would love to see the Metas for that, and I feel that more low tiers would be used.

3570 2018-05-04 14:13:03 My take is that privy investors, including, legislators, policymakers, law enforcement, etc. [insiders], are playing both ends against the middle, ie, buying (global) stocks & commodities futures. Buy on up, sell on down, win-win. An average investor is dead meat in that game.

3665 2018-05-04 13:35:56 And wages aren’t rising.  Companies were gifted tons of money from your new tax plan and just like everybody said, they bought back stocks and did not raise wages.  Put more money in your pocket but not anybody else’s.
3666 2018-05-04 13:35:54 Stock market is waiting for the deal with China to reverse and when it does it will be a huge bull market. With earning season for companies happening it’s a great time to buy these cheap cheap stocks. #MAGA

3681 2018-05-04 13:28:40 Caution. You stopped brining up stocks. Don’t bring up anything that you won’t use in bad times. It’s great that it’s 3.9, ensure Mnuchine doesn’t devalue our dollar to keep it at 3.9. Your cabinet members can screw it quicker than you think.

3683 2018-05-04 13:27:24 We all have watchlists but the most important thing for me was to develop a sysytem that highlights price and volume events that occur on stocks within those lists. We can burnout flipping through too many charts. We need our technology to work for us.

3690 2018-05-04 13:25:17 Good time to buy stocks
3691 2018-05-04 13:24:45 Going off of his net worth is inaccurate. You have to keep in mind that majority of those billions of dollars are in stocks, not his pocket. He could lose that all in minutes. And it’s not like he could just take it out all at once without hurting Amazon tremendously.
3692 2018-05-04 13:24:17 Why everyday do you trash Macy's. I don't invest in retail stocks but you give no rationell for your bankruptcy belief.  Would love to hear why every day you scream bankruptcy

3698 2018-05-04 13:20:55 It's my observation over 40 yrs (I have no hard data) that most stocks that are shorted in extreme numbers who have their CEO rail about the short selling, most, but not all, of those companies have real problems. $TSLA

3707 2018-05-04 13:17:18 I listened to a similar report this morning, didn't come off of Fox News though, very moderate job growth nothing special, no significant increase in wages and salary, stocks are still down from recent losses, but the Stock Market is not even a good indicator.

3710 2018-05-04 13:16:40 well #'s are just so people can click on it and see all the tweets about that word.

Long term investing is a lazy game. 

If u own only 15 stocks, u need to be active only 60 days in a year at most. On the days, the quarterly results come out! 

The inability to do nothing creates the most problems!

3744 2018-05-04 12:58:29 Should be selling both.

It's not a coincidence that bonds and stocks have been performing poorly as the Fed hikes and sells assets.

There was a slight delay though.
3745 2018-05-04 12:58:28 You pos! Obama created millions of jobs and set everything up that your bragging about. Your not responsible for someone getting up and applying for a job! Look at the stocks! Your starting to take effect!
3746 2018-05-04 12:58:27 Should job creation be the end all for everything the government does? Shouldn’t public safety, the environment, the wellbeing of the people of the USA not be more important. Companies have shown time again that they put profit over safety. 

I’m happy your stocks are doing well!

3763 2018-05-04 12:47:23 Dec of 2000 a good time to be buying stocks or we had already begun to roll over into a bear market? This time we started to roll in Feb. Member stocks are instant discount mechanism that peak 6 to 9 months into the future. Trump tweeted from 1973 today. Another top..
3764 2018-05-04 12:46:45 Tell them that we need to save our children and ban bump stocks and automatic weapons.  All americans need to own is a riffle and a handgun.

This timeline...
3766 2018-05-04 12:44:53 My forecast is that the stock will go up and down and then up again. Perhaps that is how all stocks work as I am recently learning how the market works.

3771 2018-05-04 12:42:57 Would avoid buying bank stocks. More interesting online pay service companies, and credit card companies.
3772 2018-05-04 12:42:45 Here's PROOF that good news for the stock market (and high stock prices) is NOT good news for average workers . . . because when wages go UP, many times stocks go DOWN. Stocks have over TRIPLED since they bottomed out in March 2009, but wages haven't tripled during the same time.
3773 2018-05-04 12:42:22 Apple would ruin all of those acquisitions.  A stock buy back is ok if they grant those stocks to all of their low level employees.  Obviously their net margin / FTE is too high.  Corporations don’t have to live forever but all stakeholders should be compensated proportionally.

3920 2018-05-04 11:20:50 I keep looking for this market to crack but it won’t. Major stocks like AMZN and AAPL are at the highs or have made new highs in this correction.  I think it takes news to really get the panic going or I’m wrong. 8 times the 200dma has been tested. Even closed below, once.
3921 2018-05-04 11:20:37 only assuming if he IS  Burning " through money.  If not shorting is a stupid thing to do. I have learned alot about stocks just by watching the stock since day 1.  Kicking myself i didn't buy any when at $30.. but like i said i don't play the market
3922 2018-05-04 11:20:28 Then why has my stock portfolio/ investments lost 15% in the last 8 weeks. Plus look at the Buffet stocks losses  and he is the smartest investor there is. What is REALLY going on?
3923 2018-05-04 11:20:25 Well it is great for me because Robinhood Crypto is tied to my normal brokerage account so I can diversify between crypto, stocks, & bonds seamlessly. Also it will makes doing taxes easier because my investments are all in the same place & Robinhood intergrates w TurboTax

Adding to the debt at a record pace and unless you're the 1% tax cuts are small and temporary. Unemployment isn't even a whole point lower than Obama. Stocks have lost all gains for the year.

3968 2018-05-04 10:51:25 I'd be daft if I thought I'd know the answer to your question Immie. I'm now treating my builders as income payers rather than growth stocks. If the situation changes, I'll review. They are much better managed now than pre-credit crunch.
3969 2018-05-04 10:50:33 Issue will be with smaller brokers. How will they manage their costs, personal lives. I think exchanges would not be able to convince them.

3975 2018-05-04 10:45:40 Look at all those people chasing $aapl up. Pretty silly. Buy high? Very dumb. Buffet bought in $150’s and here you are buying it up $20+ and 15% higher just because he said he bought. Crazy retail. You make money by buying low and dips. Not highs on stocks.

3998 2018-05-04 10:23:35 Your stock selection is gud and timing no has ever mastered the art.

4026 2018-05-04 09:51:51 The issue with Tesla (and most of Elon's companies) is that a lot of people are trying to make money out of shorting their stocks, so they over-hype those issues.. Meanwhile, institutional investors are remaining steady and keeping their shares on those companies.

4089 2018-05-04 09:10:51 Not all stocks give you voting power or a dividend. Prime example is normal Berkshire Hathaway shares. You litterally have to hope someone is willing to pay more than what you did. Just like bitcoin. stock price, like bitcoin and is only based on sentiment.

4323 2018-05-04 05:22:03 Large buy-and-hold investors like Baron Capital are also unlikely to move the stock price during an earnings call because they don't trade stocks on a knee-jerk basis. I'd be curious to know what percentage of shares need to be traded to move the stock price like that.

4435 2018-05-04 03:11:11 At the Museum of Slavery, I saw metals masks that held a person's mouth shut if they 'talked back' & cut your tongue if you moved it. I saw whips designed to cause maximum skin splitting. I saw head & arm stocks made to immobilise & chains I could barely lift. Kanye should visit.

4441 2018-05-04 03:08:31 They’re laughing stocks now tho.  They have a reputation for being weak mentally.  Masai won’t like it.
4442 2018-05-04 03:07:51 I watch NASDAQ & Dow Jones daily, ALL of the stocks traded equate to gains/losses to shareholders. There is no morality rating for these stocks/companies. It is a simple formula...Volume, shares and profit/loss (simplified) traders do not care about your morality, only making $$$
4443 2018-05-04 03:04:29 Thanks for the advice, but basically playing with the house's money now (up to a 50% drop) and don't think tech stocks are still overvalued like they were in 2001 or 2007. Have stop-loss limits set to protect gains.

4484 2018-05-04 02:43:21 Not really a stock guy on the granular level.  In the macro-picture it seems stocks will face head winds from expectations for Fed rate hikes and by extension the 10-yr Tsy yield.  I reckon it depends on how much wind is still at the back of equities from the tax cuts.

4498 2018-05-04 02:36:05 In the stock market you are typically buying into companies that have some type of tangible product that people actually use or buy. With crypto it’s mainly speculation that some day it will have real world use. Stocks are more stable in my opinion.

4505 2018-05-04 02:31:06 It’s important that when you’re talking about investing you’re diversifying your portfolio. So it’s good for it to include stocks and bonds but you also want it to have some mix of MF’s and ETF’s.

4533 2018-05-04 02:18:31 I've made that analogy about the two for some time now. Never understood its massive run up. Cult stocks eventually fizzle and $roku is one. Do we really think we'll need to hook up little boxes to our TVs in the coming yrs?

4549 2018-05-04 02:05:31 Let's agree to disagree, and we can do an experiment then, starting now in May 2018. Let's compare notes as time goes by! I'm all in on Bitcoin and Litecoin. As for equities, I have a substantial investment in precious metals mining stocks, which are due for some positive years.

4553 2018-05-04 02:02:03 This is like reading bulletin boards back in the day pumping penny stocks. Beware. You may make lots of USD and you may lose it all. I’d much rather buy options on equities...much safer with as much upside potential.
4554 2018-05-04 01:59:53 Idk how i got a random +$100 in my stocks if everything went down but whatever I’ll take it

I don't understand fundamentally why stocks would go up from here, but your evidence shows likely higher rates, lower dollar, higher commodities, and higher stocks. Would it be safe to say we're going through hyperinflation?

4561 2018-05-04 01:55:44 Yes, some of my best investments have been high PE stocks, high because they have only just made their first profit or are investing heavily for growth. $MVP and $NAN come to mind. It certainly is an important metric but as you say you need to dig deeper to fully understand it.

4575 2018-05-04 01:45:44 I’m still not sure investors really do (should?) look at bonds as competition to stocks but it’s hard to make the case for taking much in the way of duration risk right now

4598 2018-05-04 01:22:08 And that is the problem with tax cuts. The vast majority of them because of how they are written goes to the ultra wealthy and huge corporations who use it to buy back stocks and boost their price. What about tax cuts to just the middle class. You know the small business owners?

4601 2018-05-04 01:17:25 I don't know the term but I do know that the AR's we buy do not have military grade barrels. Thats why bump stocks smoke a barrel in no time flat. Also receivers tend to wear and jam faster due to steel quality.
4602 2018-05-04 01:17:24 Perhaps Trump has 10 billion tied up in stocks, bonds, money misappropriated from Trump University, Trump Estates, bankruptcy bills and his Russian  government check did not come to pay back Cohen in time. Cohen knew Trump's history and needed to make the installment plan.

4609 2018-05-04 01:11:05 Hi new investors! A thought:

If you think that the stock market being down 40% in a year means the stock market is "broken," you're not ready to invest. 

A negative 40% year will certainly suck an Andre the Giant-sized bag of dicks, but it does not mean that stocks are broken

4641 2018-05-04 00:38:37 US stocks rebounded from early lows but still ended mostly weaker on Thursday, as investors tried to reconcile a strong domestic economic outlook with ramped-up trade war rhetoric from the White House and renewed uncertainty over the Iran nuclear deal.

4646 2018-05-04 00:31:08 To an extent we agree with that.

Most gun owners I know own the ar-15 type rifle and don't want them banned.

Banning bump stocks are a band aid. And so is the age restriction.

4650 2018-05-04 00:30:11 I cannot get over the fact that our government is passing MORE for guns while there’s such a huge anti-gun faction.  They should be talking only about banning bump stocks and large magazines.
4651 2018-05-04 00:28:42 Hahaha I should change it to “mostly annoyed. Also I don’t have money to invest in stocks”
4652 2018-05-04 00:25:54 1) banning bump stocks would actually do very little due to it being almost as easy to make one as it is to put one on the gun
2) AR-15s or rifles in general are not actually what's used in mass shootings. Handguns account for more mass shootings than rifles and shotguns combined
4653 2018-05-04 00:25:04 Which in theory is great, in practice it’s a different story. Most Corp. are going to use their extra money to buyback stocks, infrastructure still struggles as most people will use their money to reinvest in the market and I get slapped with owing taxes even tho I already pay.
4654 2018-05-04 00:24:05 Someone's mostly unsellable stocks gaining a lot of value is a pretty unimportant occurrence, but it gets like 50% of the coverage by socialists and the like. I just think our efforts would be much better used focused on problems that we can actually change.

4660 2018-05-04 00:19:19 What they are asking for is supported by most Americans even gun owners. The goal is to make it harder to be a mass murderer. Bump stocks, better checks, increased age to get AR-15 to 21, ban weapons that mass shooters like. Veterans support this.

4678 2018-05-04 00:00:01 Yes, value stocks sometimes perform better than growth stocks. And vice versa.

Problem is, no one can reliably predict ahead of time when that will occur. Don’t let anyone try to tell you otherwise.
