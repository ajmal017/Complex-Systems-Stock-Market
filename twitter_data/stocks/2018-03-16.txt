7 2018-03-17 23:36:16 For anyone looking for solid, upward-trending stocks to invest in, look no further than @HailStateMT & @HailStateWT - these Dawgs are GETTING. IT. DONE. in the SEC! #HailState

11 2018-03-17 23:32:51 Watch the market leaders, the stocks that have led the charge upward in a bull market. That is where the action is and where the money is to be made. As the leaders go, so goes the entire market.
12 2018-03-17 23:30:25 @fishingforleave Media telling us to start eating Dab and Gurnard which are supposed to be sustainable stocks while the rest of Europe fishes our Haddock Cod and Plaice etc sounds about right for Theresa
13 2018-03-17 23:29:00 What about you dumping bank stocks after a confidential meeting about the impending crisis?
14 2018-03-17 23:25:52 This is something most people don't think about. GUN'S DON'T KILL PEOPLE, PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE, is something that you can't control, the human integration can use anything as a weapon so banning certain guns does bother me. Bump stocks & what MD has done so far good. But no more.

34 2018-03-17 23:22:07 And stocks are at anxiety
35 2018-03-17 23:20:07 worse than stocks man
36 2018-03-17 23:17:52 I'm pretty happy with how I played last night at the Lab. In the sets where I was actually using my head I was ledge trapping/punishing pretty damn well, but for some reason I get way too comfy when I get early stocks. I need to learn how to play lamer when I have a big lead.
37 2018-03-17 23:16:15 If stocks continue to rally the treasury rally will soon be history IMHO.
38 2018-03-17 23:16:04 & the tech stocks aren’t pricey?  Please. I’d rather pay $1 for a pot stock than $300 for a tech play. BC I guarantee when a recession hits, people will go w/o the latest iPhone upgrade to buy their #cannabis  And talk about market cap, its not even LEGAL yet. Just wait.
39 2018-03-17 23:14:44 I got a 70% ROI in my stocks this yr. Thank you President Obama. U don't understand economics so U wouldn't understand.

Tax cuts great, for ME. I don't need help. I'm in the .01%. Don't need a new Mercedes. But U would wouldn't understand that either. 

What do U understand?
40 2018-03-17 23:14:38 Lol. He is pumping a concept that does not currently exist. He can't profit from it. We will figure out the regulations around tokens representing ownership of real estate, stocks, and liabilities on globally reaching networks with feeless exchanges. This will change capitalism.
41 2018-03-17 23:14:38 Will be posting some videos tonight and tomorrow. Will help "speed up" our learning curve.  #stocks

44 2018-03-17 23:07:12 Which call? That all #lithium stocks declined as you keep mentioning in all your other posts. That seems to be your excuse when people question why $FAT is down.

Funny thing about all lithium declining is that $FAT was the biggest decliner - 73.64% decline to be exact! Terrible!
45 2018-03-17 23:06:51 If I cut out dominos and keep the 100nok, I can at the end of the month buy 62 shares of abg Sundal Collier, which nets me 11,2% return resulting in 7 shares extra every 3 months. In other words, I should cut out dominos and buy stocks.
46 2018-03-17 23:05:30 1.Why does a stock go up in price?  Not kidding.   2. What patterns provide the best "launch pad?"  These are very important questions we must answer. #stocks
47 2018-03-17 23:04:37 You sold bank stocks after a briefing from the fed, crook.
48 2018-03-17 23:02:48 @Parianas @_machiparu_ @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
49 2018-03-17 22:59:27 Oh, goodness, no. If you've difficulty accommodating a collar, I'm happy to fit your neck into the stocks out on the green. Some fresh air and sunshine and no ability to see who's approaching you from behind will do you good.
50 2018-03-17 22:58:58 @AdVenture_CapHH games pretty cool, yall should add more available options for buying business shares and stocks
51 2018-03-17 22:58:49 You don't have more money in your paychecks,401k,stocks,etc?  I have a hard time believing that. In 2019.when you file your taxes you will be in for a very pleasant surprise
52 2018-03-17 22:58:39 If you have ever been to ihub you definitely know who I am.  I am paid to bash stocks to encourage traders to sell.  Me and my minion crew are pretty good at it @ClayTader25 @BoycottIhub @DirtStarBandit @ScamPumpers I highly recommend you going to @InvestorHangout 
53 2018-03-17 22:56:43 1st, "Felicity", those trials were 50 years ago, 30 years before Russia invented, developed & manufactured tonnes of Novichok-class nerve toxins.
2nd, the UK used simple chemicals that were pretty harmless.
3rd. Russia hid their stocks of Novichok-class nerve toxins from OPCW
54 2018-03-17 22:53:41 me: I should get a keg for my paddys party

*stocks up on Vodka Soda* #MemorialDayIn2Months
55 2018-03-17 22:53:37 Yeah I’m working on it just small capital won’t let me work on some stocks that I know they run. So I have less options. But thank you your strategy is the one and only who have give me results in sush a short time.
56 2018-03-17 22:50:46 From “thank you for being late” “value is shifting from knowledge stocks to knowledge flows...” @NYS_DASNY Time to share our expertise!
57 2018-03-17 22:50:29 That one make stocks drop. By angel investors still put eye for ground
58 2018-03-17 22:46:18 Just read a very interesting article about so called nerve gas and who had stocks of it our government and civil servants have very short memory’s because in 1991 it was in Uzbekistan as it was a testing centre for chemical weapons no mention of it #bbcnews
59 2018-03-17 22:45:58 Some people ask me why I throw parties so heres the answer. 
My family struggle with money so my party money is used to pay my mom bills plus my lil sister step show fees. And also my tuition. Im an entrepreneur I do stocks and parties and real estate. #myasu
60 2018-03-17 22:45:10 When you say "us" I take it you mean yourself and your wife. Given that you advocate a hard brexit, you are lying, the economy WILL be hit. Got shorts on any stocks and currencies ?
61 2018-03-17 22:44:11 Some regulation is good , but this seems too fast and too far reaching considering most people coming up with the regulations know a lot more about stocks/securities than crypto currency. They need to do it more gradually and educate themselves more on the subject first imo.
62 2018-03-17 22:40:44 Give an inch they’ll take a foot. Conservatives don’t trust liberals when they say all they want is background checks and to ban bump stocks.
63 2018-03-17 22:39:49 Haha  thanks
64 2018-03-17 22:36:06 My father in law said he made $70k last year on pot stocks... I think he’s just blowing smoke.

67 2018-03-17 22:32:09 Limited stocks of knowledge
68 2018-03-17 22:31:12 Another "mean spirited" move from the Trump administration. Where is the compassion in this President's administration? Banning bump stocks, tossing paper towels to hurricane survivors, big corporate tax cuts... Is that it?  How about some common decency??

71 2018-03-17 22:29:43 Not funny, but alarming. In Germany conspiracy theories going wild, it might have been US agents who launched the attack. Evidence: USA helped to dismantle Russian poison gas stocks in the Nineties. 

Sometimes I wonder, if this is still my country

I literally curse the day Mourinho was born. Bastard
80 2018-03-17 22:16:10 The fact that my weird supermarketlet only ever stocks parsley, dill, and chives is my main argument for not living here.
81 2018-03-17 22:15:05 The establishment frenzy over this Stocks fiasco is drawing attention away from this Xi Jinping news.
82 2018-03-17 22:14:37 Nd AR15's are not easily modified unless ur a gunsmith who has a machine shop, if u mean bump stocks, they are illegal in California.
83 2018-03-17 22:14:23 Amazing Rebecca, it's looking fab so far
84 2018-03-17 22:14:11 @canuck2usa does a great one covering stocks, options and futures but you need to be a subscriber to his service.
85 2018-03-17 22:13:20 I think you have to learn that there’s a company behind every stock and there’s only one real reason why stocks go up.
86 2018-03-17 22:12:53 Looking at cherry blossom tree that is half-bloomed and noticed old dead limbs. No new flowers there! Made me think of junior mining stocks.
87 2018-03-17 22:10:13 Stunning work Rebecca I want one 
88 2018-03-17 22:07:05 The so called economic expansion is mainly cloistered around a few companies.

Not to mention it's standing on quicksand (artificial interest rate cap). 

As soon as rates rise, stocks come down..

As soon as those GOK obtained loans mature, currency devalues or prices rise....
89 2018-03-17 22:06:24 Brilliant!
90 2018-03-17 22:06:08 yeah thats exactly what I assumed was happening so avoided it. Might not happen now a days as he probably makes more money on the lessons than trading stocks.
91 2018-03-17 22:03:37 Yeah mate it is technically gambling as is stocks and share. You have to be 18+.
92 2018-03-17 22:03:06 Better buy some IKEA stocks, they have thousands of forks.
93 2018-03-17 21:59:44 You have a right to own guns society deems are safe. That's settled constitutional law. You can't own nerve agents or nukes nor could I bring home my F15 and keep it parked outside my garage. Same legal principle is why bump stocks can be banned.
94 2018-03-17 21:59:04 TRUMP 1yr, ISSI finished, 1 trillion back in treasury, company's returning,taxes lowered,stocks way up,and he donates his salary to non profits, Obama trashed our USA, how y'all said #it's OUR TIME, Back the fuck UP
95 2018-03-17 21:57:42 Looks even better in real life, can’t wait to see the finished drawing 
96 2018-03-17 21:55:22 Finding stocks like $BVTK beat the hell out of trying to jump from one stock to the other. Having long time gains is huge. As it picks up pace over the next couple of years the percentage gain will be astronomical. When it’s pennies it will be nothing to be up 100’s % in a day
97 2018-03-17 21:54:39 Democrats try to take as much as they can get away with when it comes to gun control. I support the age to 21, bump stocks should never have neen allowed but with this bill they tried to add other bans. This we can't allow, most states have enough laws they need to follow them.
98 2018-03-17 21:52:39 Caption: it will only hurt for a minute
99 2018-03-17 21:52:35 I'm 100% against it, and a ban on bump-stocks is just another symbolic feel-good measure that won't accomplish anything in the end. Also, Mexico, Venezuela, and South Africa (Where guns are illegal) have MORE gun deaths per capita than the US.

102 2018-03-17 21:51:10 Should Trump go back to adultry? He probably already has...multiple times.
103 2018-03-17 21:50:34 Cause: lied                                   effect: fired.
104 2018-03-17 21:49:58 All I know is that Obama sucked! I couldn’t wait till he was out! Never saw so many terrorist attacks...I don’t give a  what Trump says and how he says it.  I have more $ in my pocket, isis is on way out, more jobs, more in my stocks.  Will vote again!
105 2018-03-17 21:49:39 You’re backing a proven liar and defending disbarred lawyers. Yeah Believable.....NOT
106 2018-03-17 21:47:43 She should go back to prostitution. Little Larry’s pretty women.
107 2018-03-17 21:44:40 My stocks been doing trash this month omg 
108 2018-03-17 21:43:20 In hyper-inflation, being long stocks is short the home currency, right? (e.g. Venezuela).
109 2018-03-17 21:43:14 I vote against every executive compensation incentive on stocks I own because I know itdilutes shareholder value
110 2018-03-17 21:43:03 COLONIAL SOCIETY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
111 2018-03-17 21:42:27 Not many stocks with metrics like that of BILN Rhomboid but you would nearly think the market is pricing in some sort of over caution to a downturn that has yet to materialise.  The dividend is the key for my investment here.
112 2018-03-17 21:41:40 Nikulin lying about the Russians never having it.
Well documented in1990s they had it & tested it.
Is that single fact that May's entire case relies on.
Ignores further evidence that the Russians destroyed all stocks
Ignores it was synthesised in several western labs for defence
113 2018-03-17 21:39:46 ya’ll think i could put money into stocks and remain jobless but comfortable

117 2018-03-17 21:34:11 What I’m saying is that any vulnerabilities requiring root access is like saying your house is not secure because you can unlock its doors. Also it’s obviously done to hurt AMD’s stocks for their own gain

122 2018-03-17 21:31:44 That’s what obama..Hillary & her bunch did. Trump hasn’t done any of those. I’m happy..my taxes are lower..my 401K..IRA’s..stocks..etc are bleeding money..He’s slowly but surely getting rid of the illegals..walls being built. More great things to come.
123 2018-03-17 21:29:48 Ya I thought same thing, maybe Monday will come around. Although I googled it and seen others had issues, might be due to Canadian stocks
124 2018-03-17 21:29:35 The swamp he first stocks by hiring only the best
125 2018-03-17 21:28:15 Early on in life I was burnt by mining stocks, wanted to give it another try. Was looking for for a while... will wait for big buyout. I don’t have much understanding of mining industry so limited play
126 2018-03-17 21:26:40 Yesss well done on win guys  @nucci39 @CharlieMosey @elcreido18 @Heeels @jisaacs5 @PeteyL88 @C_Schaber @RBirzi @Stocks_68 @Josh_Scoon @dirtydc13 @jjorgensen15 @Marrsy33 @Chadmister10 @RussMoyer safe journey home everyone

128 2018-03-17 21:26:18 I never buy on IPO day as usually everybody has FOMO so “Its Probably Overpriced” I’ve seen a couple of stocks promoted on here perform well on IPO day only to capitulate soon after. $RHY is an example, you were better to enter weeks later under IPO price.
129 2018-03-17 21:25:47 Drowned in pools at OC2 :[

Both Dissent and Neko played well! I'm a little upset both sets ended in a misinput :( I meant to Can out of Diddy Up Smash / Marth FAir and I got Clay Pigeon instead, so it broke and I lost my stocks both sets.

Best of luck to the both of them!

132 2018-03-17 21:22:22 If you are a good law abiding citizen why would you not be able to pass a more stringent background check in order to get your gun? I’m sure you can get a gun just fine.  No one needs military grade assault riffles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines for self defence though.
133 2018-03-17 21:21:48 No where does it say that you have the right to bullets, bump stocks or having the “arms” in public places. You just have a right to own guns and that’s it
134 2018-03-17 21:21:20 We will have to disagree and yes semi automatics should be banned.  They are not covered under 2a as per supreme court, they were banned previously & along with bump stocks are not needed over hand guns for self defence.
135 2018-03-17 21:21:03 Tbh the stocks sales guy is the hottest man Ive ever seen. I'd invest. ;) #WLWTournament2018

139 2018-03-17 21:17:11 @indianteams @twentytenmedia @FXS_Stocks_DE - You're my top new connects this week!
140 2018-03-17 21:16:33 Democrats need to stop using the word gun control without having any idea what they’re talking about.  The conversation should be started by saying bump stocks should be illegal.
141 2018-03-17 21:16:01 Really good variety for adding to global wheat stocks and decreasing prices
142 2018-03-17 21:15:28 That’s irrelevant.... I have a right to own a gun and as much ammunition as I want.  I never stated bump stocks should be legal.  They were originally developed for handicapped people to still be able to shoot for sport.  Criminal minded have taken it one step further though.
143 2018-03-17 21:15:14 Bill does NADA about America's GUN fetish problem - you can still buy bump stocks and AR-15's and have all the guns and amo you want - carry them across state lines and shoot up schools, movie theaters, concerts. Time for the GOP+NRA love fest to end!
144 2018-03-17 21:15:08 This time of year is my fav bcus lamb is on offer and Dad stocks up 
145 2018-03-17 21:13:55 Missouri can't do anything against this 5 out. Smesko is a genius
146 2018-03-17 21:13:16 Check out the teamwork, patience and spacing of @FGCU_WBB... nice!
147 2018-03-17 21:12:36 I was just drawing a parallel to the stock market, which I stand by. The biggest difference is that the stock market or at least most stocks have theoretical floors, most crypto assets don't.
148 2018-03-17 21:12:01 Thank you! Michters is difficult to find up here but I know at least one store downtown that stocks it.
149 2018-03-17 21:11:01 Lol..I thinks it’s off-license time tomorrow, restock our depleting stocks!
150 2018-03-17 21:10:45 An AR 15 is just like any other semi auto rifle. Bump Stocks are stupid.
151 2018-03-17 21:08:47 Agree to a certain extent but when states are objecting to the van of bump stocks? No-one needs them. No-one needs semi- automatic weapons. If you need a rifle for hunting, ok. Apart from that no-one needs a gun. It works in most other civilised countries.
152 2018-03-17 21:06:04 I think everybody else always fails to realize that inflation always wins. Buy every investment you're able to buy as early as you can buy. Buy stocks and housing in the 1910's, buy Bitcoin in the 2010's

154 2018-03-17 21:02:42 The Motley Fool is clickbait to sell their lame AI stocks. Read their articles regularly to stop reading their articles.

156 2018-03-17 21:00:47 The space they are in is a 70 trill market. They are bring crypto forex and normal stocks to the same place! With only a little over a 100 mill market cap theres alot of room to grow.  Gotta use the token for the platform. I think i really found a winner

158 2018-03-17 20:59:17 You don’t lose until you sell.  That’s one of the top principles in stocks. Sorry for your loss.
159 2018-03-17 20:58:11 It’s shameful and disgraceful to see what depths this country has fallen to! Let’s not let our portfolios destroy our American assets! If this country falls to dictatorship, what value will your stocks have in the pockets of Russian oligarchs!?
160 2018-03-17 20:57:49 There is anger, but it is justified. A lot of ideas about what to do has been said, but the universal agreements are: a federal background check before being able to purchase a gun, and tighter regulation on guns, specifically "assault weapons" and banning items like bump stocks.
161 2018-03-17 20:53:57 The deficit is growing and the wealthy business owners are buying back stocks
162 2018-03-17 20:53:08 Seneca has said, “Without a ruler to do it against, you can’t make crooked straight.” That is the role of wise people in our lives—to serve as model and inspiration. Who that person will be for you is up to you.

164 2018-03-17 20:52:23 I was being sarcastic, should have tagged it. :-) - essentially in another forum I suggested banning bump stocks and got a "how would that solve the issue" as a conservative response.
165 2018-03-17 20:52:02 I said stocks n gold are also long USD. Meant stocks n bonds.
166 2018-03-17 20:51:27 When Jeff Sessions gets to prison for perjury and obstruction of justice, he will be so beloved in the prison community. Especially by minorities whom he has treated so fairly. Hope he stocks up on plenty of lube.

168 2018-03-17 20:49:39 All depends if the crypto and weed stocks start to rally again. Junior miners tend to be weak from pdac conference through approx Sept.
169 2018-03-17 20:49:11 Perhaps. Most people aren’t psychologically predisposed to shorting but even in downtrending market I guess you could find stocks going up but would lose a bit on stops getting hit more often.
170 2018-03-17 20:46:10 @Nakumatt I once came across a very beautiful duvet in one of your stores. Seems someone bought it before I did. Would you kindly recommend to me one of your stores that stocks a variety of them?
171 2018-03-17 20:45:45 Comics are like stocks, you can even short sell!

196 2018-03-17 20:18:15 HAD is the past tense. If stocks were truly destroyed they would not be available for use.

202 2018-03-17 20:15:47 But Toys R Us just announced they are closing all 800 stores. That's 34,000+ unemployed. Not to mention the ripple effect of all those empty buildings in already struggling shopping centers. Mattel and Hasboro stocks are falling. Other retailers are closing too. #savetoysrus
203 2018-03-17 20:15:01 Time to short Indonesian stocks then. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a earthquake waiting to be triggered/initiated.
204 2018-03-17 20:14:01 Lol!  

I’m not gonna lie, I’ve been tempted to do the same on some of these cheap stocks, but still haven’t. 

I would most likely buy them even further out. Like 120+ DTE

220 2018-03-17 19:47:27 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

223 2018-03-17 19:43:39 Hahaha I know, Pat. You wouldn’t do anything like that. As far as I’m concerned, drinking at home is best drinking. I have bottles of wine and umeshu in our stocks.

225 2018-03-17 19:41:32 Stocks can go up or down. there is neither perfect science behind the behavior of market participants nor the outcome of the stock price movement. 

You only enter the trade with understanding the probability of the outcome

The only control you have is "how you manage your risk"
226 2018-03-17 19:40:52 We have one.  Need a Federal license for a fully automatic weapon.  Ban bump stocks.  Enforce the laws on the books.
227 2018-03-17 19:39:40 He was comparing it to semis which is pretty much all rifles. Full autos are already illegal and so are bump stocks now. It looking scary is not a good reason. Any gun looks scary from the wrong end.
228 2018-03-17 19:39:14 I love the downside as it sifts out the weak stocks from the strong giving excellent opportunities to go long.
229 2018-03-17 19:38:47 There is even less facts in that article than in the government's evidence. The Russians destroyed all their chemical stocks? Really? They don't just keep a little bit? Laughable

I completely believe his claims at the IQ he has or at least close.
251 2018-03-17 19:11:44 Hopefully the stock count for the next game isn't 2 or even 1 so we can have room for a faster game with comboing like that. Having only 2 stocks in sm4sh with rage and free af combos for grapplers/bayo etc. was terrible lol.
252 2018-03-17 19:09:54 LMFAO.

256 2018-03-17 19:07:33 Being shot at, seeing your friends murdered, hiding under your desk so you won't get shot gives you street cred and the right to speak on gun control.  This issue isn't complex.  It's simple. No assault rifles. No bump stocks. No guns til 21. Strong background checks.  Simple.

267 2018-03-17 18:57:44 Trump says many things and doesn’t do any of it. Again I’ll wait until he actually tries to do something about banning bump stocks. Also a ban on bump stocks would have helped with the Vegas shooting but would have done nothing for parkland
268 2018-03-17 18:55:07 This is putting a bandaid on a gapping head wound. 
Ban on bump stocks.
Raise the minimum age to purchase assault weapons to 21.
Universal background checks.
I’ll be voting in November, but not for a NRA supported candidate.
269 2018-03-17 18:54:47 Trump is a moderate conservative ... Bush's would never make an executive order to ban bump stocks
270 2018-03-17 18:54:30 I'm hurt I sold my Twitter stocks when they were at $18. Now they $36 
271 2018-03-17 18:51:59 Tous les mêmes ...l'intérêt supérieur de leur Pays???
272 2018-03-17 18:51:53 Well that's my point, big markets depend on greater fool theory and expansion. Large part of investors in stocks would not want stagnant equity, considering there's an unavoidable fiat currency inflation.
273 2018-03-17 18:51:49 Trump already said he was going to make an executive order to ban bump stocks
274 2018-03-17 18:50:57 That's the better way to do it, but I like squandering away my gains in gutter-stocks
275 2018-03-17 18:50:34 Talking about stocks on my days off <<<<
276 2018-03-17 18:47:35 We also need to reserve the fish stocks which have been decimated with EU fishing methods.
277 2018-03-17 18:47:04 I've not thought that far ahead. I've never not had any debt to pay off. Got my stocks and shares isa and junior isas. And would like to set up dd to pension. Plus save for a holiday to Disney oh and converting the loft. Hmmm lots of things
278 2018-03-17 18:46:25 Why does the NRA think that background checks and restricted semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks mean someone is coming to take away their rights to own a gun? Why do they think erring on the side of caution is punishing them? It’s because they are the real zealots! SMH!
279 2018-03-17 18:45:28 On this point, we don't need to change the Constitution to ban something as ridiculous as bump-stocks, do we?

282 2018-03-17 18:44:02 Than outlaw  AR15s, bump stocks and everything that makes it easier to killl many people and make it a big crime for anyone to let juveniles have access to fire arms  that "travel" outside their home.

294 2018-03-17 18:30:33 Two chapters in,  and the protagonists, which have been established to be laughing stocks, beat two S+ rank inklings.  Yeah...no. I'm not against underdog stories,  but I can only stretch my sense of disbelief so far.

300 2018-03-17 18:27:38 The President did whatever he can to protect Americans and the country. The stocks hit the ceiling. Is that an evil act? You must be mental

308 2018-03-17 18:25:11 Half as many new businesses are being created today than 40 years ago and half as many public stocks listed than 20 years ago. Corporate consolidation by "Big Tech" is stifling broad based economic growth & opportunities & hurting the middle class.
309 2018-03-17 18:25:07 they might run away if they see this sooo DQ stocks 
310 2018-03-17 18:25:06 Al Franken the guy who molested an airman. Come on little Larry.
311 2018-03-17 18:23:37 Comrade Comey.
312 2018-03-17 18:22:58 Why're u guys doing this? You're not only making laughing stocks of yourselves to the politicians you have both been rightly castigating, you're also taking us ur followers along in this disgraceful behaviour. I am disappointed in the both of you.
313 2018-03-17 18:22:49 Prostitution is Mika’s new obsession
314 2018-03-17 18:20:55 Stocks have been globalised since the internet. Just not decentralised. So whats the advantage to for a centralised organisation to have control of the company floating on a blockchain?
315 2018-03-17 18:20:51 I think with all the stronger performing stocks people are looking for better options than $amd
316 2018-03-17 18:20:02 The stocks would crash. 50% is a huge number. But people can cash out of stocks over time, organically - companies do share buybacks, or pay dividends. With cryptocurrencies, to cash out, you can only do so if you find a greater fool.
317 2018-03-17 18:19:39 Are they truly pro-second Amendment or would infringe on our rights like banning bump stocks or stealing rights from young adults?
318 2018-03-17 18:19:29 I'm one of the 98% I can't afford stocks
319 2018-03-17 18:19:08 Who to follow for stocks, commodities, indexes, etc.?
320 2018-03-17 18:19:01 Companies are buying their own stocks, central banks buying their own bonds. This is a stupid, fake economy. The future is bottom up not top down. @HarryDentjr burning it down at @CoinAgenda
321 2018-03-17 18:16:03 He’ll be fine! A book deal and speaking circuit will make up for the loss. They’ve unwittingly raised his stocks!
322 2018-03-17 18:14:39 what will you be trading? stocks and bonds or something more enjoyable?
323 2018-03-17 18:13:43 You are a rightie to me and to a majority according to my definition. Its ok if u don't agree as it is so. There are also crazy extreme rightie zealots such as those who believe automatics and bump stocks are rational civilian wpns.
324 2018-03-17 18:12:28 @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC - You built a great show on stocks, bonds and interest rates. Why did you turn the show into a #CryptoCurrency show?

325 2018-03-17 18:11:43 There's a B&N across the street that stocks a bunch of games (that they never sell) and we can't get through distribution... waiting for them to hit 50% off so we can stock up ;)
326 2018-03-17 18:11:42 The alternative was yoloing it on penny stocks. Either is better than a duffel bag jammed under the car seat.
327 2018-03-17 18:10:52 3/3: So if the author of this piece "doesn't know what side he's on" while voicing his preference for AR-15s and bump stocks to be banned, this isn't about gun control. It's about people like him being so in the tank with NRA propaganda, ANY regulation equals tyranny.
328 2018-03-17 18:09:29 There was news on - feet on street - lot of people benefited - purchasing of Gitanjali stocks from stock market & sell after Budget (i.e in March). some news was leaked. Highest growth or say abnormal growth in Gitanjali stocks price - before & after budget in stock market.
329 2018-03-17 18:07:36 So, the hype is real? You're convinced, well, have a pretty good gut feeling about the prospects? I'd like to start a portfolio, just want diveristy and to start small, but be opportunistic too. Willing and open to calculated risks. My dad killed it in the late 90's w tech stocks
330 2018-03-17 18:06:13 Pro-Tip: If you want a new income stream that's crypto related, there are a TON of blog and news sites looking for crypto writers right now.

A nice way to make a few hundred a month extra to put into crypto or stocks (or your savings).
331 2018-03-17 18:05:49 Also, what would happen if 50% of investors in Wall Street decided to dump stocks and withdraw their money?

341 2018-03-17 17:55:52 Nobody is omniscient, but on the balance of probabilities I don’t see Russia losing its competitive edge until the end of the season ( of next season for that matter with circa 19-20 Mmt stocks/ carry out of wheat )
342 2018-03-17 17:54:17 Stocks hit new highs usually but I would say the index hits new highs. In oct 2007 internals were awful as banks, reits, builders were rolling over but the index hit new highs. Look at staples today, retail, energy, but banks and tech leading.
343 2018-03-17 17:53:38 FOR EXAMPLE. CANAMEX GOLD FORMS ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN STRATEGIC ALLIANCE- GOLD AND SILVER ASSET BACKED CRYPTO-TOKENS.  ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE ALL STOCKS ARE TRADED USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.  
344 2018-03-17 17:53:17 Who stocks these? Or do you sell direct to trade?
345 2018-03-17 17:50:52 What do you mean by bump stocks will soon be out??? Please clarify Mr. President
346 2018-03-17 17:48:53 Successful? That's what you call pandering to Cruz? Giving A ratings to pols who sell us down the river? Caving on bump stocks because you have to pick your battles? 

If they were worth a damn they'd be repealing not condoning.
347 2018-03-17 17:48:52 If you’re into stocks.. I would carefully invest in Snapchat.. worth looking at.
348 2018-03-17 17:48:40 You are a disgusting joke. How many bump stocks were used in mass shooting? Or silencers, or extended magazines? Gotta love the left, inventing words. “Assault weapon” according to the military, the ones who ought to know, an assault weapon fires burst or fully auto.... not semi.
349 2018-03-17 17:47:30 About time you did

357 2018-03-17 17:41:54 im guessing with the stocks that they couldve had, close to 1500-2000 items and i dunno if they set up the limit per person too. Im not sure how big the flagship store is tho so they could possibly have more since BTS is popular on the Japanese market side of things
358 2018-03-17 17:41:32 And they just unleashed $2T more of expatriated money while getting about a 5% (gross) & 30% (relative) tax break. So probably , yes. Meanwhile the supply of stocks drops. Ponder the supply-demand-cost triangle. Lower supply, increased demand does WHAT to cost?
359 2018-03-17 17:39:08 Stocks have positive rates of return: companies generate cash that they return to investors. In the long run, investors win.
Cryptocurrencies have negative rates of return (negative carry): they burn cash and need new investors to pay the miners. In the long run, hodlers lose.
360 2018-03-17 17:38:29 Where does the money come from to fund those 401k tax deductions? Why does the government pick stocks and mortgage interest as winners? Might as well go full libertarian.
361 2018-03-17 17:37:31 
362 2018-03-17 17:36:11 Some people should not own stocks at all because they get too upset with price fluctuations. If you're going to do dumb things because a stock goes down you shouldn't own a stock at all. - Warren Buffett
363 2018-03-17 17:34:14 Lmfaoo Snapchat stocks already dropped 3% because of that Rihanna ad.
364 2018-03-17 17:33:34 Sure. Probably PEG ratio is a better metric than PE as negative growth is toxic to stocks.
365 2018-03-17 17:31:44 People who believe in cryptocurrencies tend to share the same misunderstanding of economics.
Do you believe money is created out of thin air?
Do you believe the stock market is rising only because people are buying stocks?
If so, I have some magical virtual coins to sell to you!
366 2018-03-17 17:29:37 Traditional stocks will transform to blockchains. We will be trading stocks like we are trading altcoins. This has already begun. It's easier, faster and cheaper.
367 2018-03-17 17:29:33 Does anyone have suggestions on things expats, and don’t own stocks, can do?

371 2018-03-17 17:27:02 Sorry - but learn why and who made bump stocks legal over NRA and impossible to change due to classification. Requires a law - which is Congress not Pres job. (now you're not use to that after 8 years of Dems)
372 2018-03-17 17:25:39 he pulled out the stocks on u dog
373 2018-03-17 17:25:18 But isn't it Congress that makes the law and not the President. Know you're confused as you stood by for 8 years watching Obama create laws.  Assault weapons are banned, and Obama Admin made bump stocks legal by declaring not part of gun.
374 2018-03-17 17:25:08 Obviously those who don’t have stocks are unable to answer two of these.
375 2018-03-17 17:24:24 If you don't have any stocks, best get on it 
376 2018-03-17 17:23:20 The market is irrational. Never the less, I recon such multiples as high risk and will not be the last idiot buying before reality is perceived by the masses. There are a enough fair priced unpopular stocks to hold though.
377 2018-03-17 17:21:09 Book club at conferences? I'm being a bit disingenuous.The librarian (@HehmanLab) at our house reads all the books and then stocks the shelves, I just live here.

395 2018-03-17 17:06:33 No I want limits on magazine capacity, a ban on assault style rifles, strong background checks, a minimum age of 21, a thorough safety training session before purchases, and a national registary of guns. Also a ban on some attachments like bump stocks. You don’t understand.

1st gen of Labor should think like this; locate where jobs are available but housing is affordable; do the math. Buy home and pay it off asap. if not dead by then; save via bonds. Pass it on to 2nd gen. Maybe by 3rd gen buy stocks.
406 2018-03-17 16:49:53 If you make the age requirement 21 it doesn’t make sense to allow 18 year olds to make the decision to join the military. I’m cool with banning bump stocks but you can still bump fire a rifle without one.
407 2018-03-17 16:48:40 Yeah and people just stopped using it, stocks dropped
408 2018-03-17 16:48:22 The Delonge episode was bizarre. Joe was laughing at him, because he was making crazy claims and then saying he couldn't talk about it. His "ufo" footage was hilariously fake. He was on there to shill stocks for his company, nothing more. Tom gets a big payout from investers.
409 2018-03-17 16:47:22 2/2 Pak conducting Azm e Nau conv. exercises to defeat CSD for almost a decade. Nasr for deterrence and all strategic systems r weapons of last resort. India has the fissile stocks and inducting N capable CF platforms for escalation dom. and NWF, it's doctrine notwithstanding.
410 2018-03-17 16:43:09 Can't stand the stock vs crypto argument. Both are speculating, only with stocks you have to pay a crap load of middle men between you and your investment. You have no decisions on the day to day operations, no voting rights nothing.

412 2018-03-17 16:37:43 Spend 3 seconds on Twitter engaging with people about contentious stocks, e.g. $tsla $ko or any biotech, and you realize how weak some of the arguments people use to justify investing their life’s savings.

438 2018-03-17 16:08:06 Well, to be honest, we don't know if he actually used those rifles or not.  All we know is that there were pictures taken of rifles in a hotel room that were equipped with bump stocks.
439 2018-03-17 16:07:45 The AR-15 platform is no different the other “regular” guns. It’s unique in its ability to be easily set up for a particular use depending on the owners preference. Adjustable stocks for people of different arm lengths. Different optics and scope configurations. Versatility.

443 2018-03-17 16:04:48 Mine changed little.  I personally want less hands in my pocket and less Gov to take my earnings.  In my view->GOV is the problem. Asking GOV to solve the problem GOV creates only gets us more of the same. 

I invest money and want stocks to perform->restricting business hurts me
444 2018-03-17 16:04:31 The #NRA has said they would oppose legislation to ban bump stocks, but they won't complain if the DOJ takes executive action--the kind of action conservatives said Obama abused.
445 2018-03-17 16:03:59 The notion that those dependent on labor to survive should own stocks is built on the false expectation that the periodicity of asset returns experienced over ~ the last 200 yrs is reliable.

454 2018-03-17 15:57:36 Snapchat stocks weren’t really doing well anyway so it only took an intense amount of influence and a certain following for the company shares to actually plunge in a matter of hours.

—Don’t underestimate the power of influence 
455 2018-03-17 15:54:45 Overall price action in stocks pulling back a bit this week, but I don’t see any red flags out there. The strong are resting or getting stronger, and the weak are getting weaker.
456 2018-03-17 15:54:34 I agree. That’s why I think without name calling and with common sense things like bump stocks would be low hanging fruit and easily banned.

472 2018-03-17 15:44:08 The rollercoaster ride of the stock market can be great if you are among the few with the extra dollars to invest ... however, even in stocks, ever wonder who Trump talks to when he goes to Florida ... his friends are getting richer while most of the rest stagnates ...

482 2018-03-17 15:33:09 Agree in a falling market no harm in going to fiat and stocking up on some stocks later on. Look at deepbrainchain - good long term project but would have been better to have sold in jan  and rebought now.
483 2018-03-17 15:29:14 Sure I do. You likely either fell for a scam or had your life savings sitting in stocks and sold off at the low.
484 2018-03-17 15:29:06 Not enough money for food? Invest in stocks. You get free steak dinners at the shareholder's meetings.
485 2018-03-17 15:28:55 Not necessarily: low management fees are compatible with selecting stocks.
486 2018-03-17 15:27:52 But the Russians said they've destroyed the stocks they had. How could they do that if they never had it?

491 2018-03-17 15:15:21 There is no such thing as an asssult weapon.  Media made up that term.  Obama approved bump stocks, Trump is outlawing them.  Authorities had some 39 chances to take crazy Cruz’ guns.  They did nothing.
492 2018-03-17 15:14:37 as did mine, following a smaller universe of stocks also provides better opportunity to really get to know the technical quirks/ behaviors of each.. how hard/often the shakeouts are, what moving average price responds to best, how volatile it acts on news events & how often, etc

494 2018-03-17 15:10:44 Snapchat made the news after the outrage of running an anti-domestic violence ad.  4% drop in stocks, for asking if people would rather beat a wifebeater (Chris Brown) or a musician  (Rihanna).  Really think about what it would mean if Americans felt that way.

504 2018-03-17 15:01:48 Clearly, Barry wanted a continuing bloodbath on his watch so he could take the guns.  Gun walking, allowing the ATF to approve sale of bump-stocks (without a peep from the WH), etc.  He was and still is fine with your death if it furthers his agenda.

516 2018-03-17 14:52:47 I find it so confusing. So, "Tax Protection" is for tax loss harvesting (unnecessary for IRA accounts), excluding some stocks from allocations (how is that tax protection?), and support for conversions to Roth IRA (generally a one-time event, so why the annual fee?).

517 2018-03-17 14:51:02 "magisterial!" - So when do we set sail for the Falklands to teach those Argy bastar.... oh bugger, sorry, errr, yeah, 
So Porton Down won't say nerve agent is made in Russia. OPCW confirm that all Russian CW stocks & Labs destroyed. May's speech is nonsense.
518 2018-03-17 14:50:13 Walmart is one of the businesses that I believe is not longer selling AR 15s or bump stocks isn’t it. Maybe they didn’t get the memo. Who knows I don’t know the people involved.
519 2018-03-17 14:49:32 The quota share discussion is about shared stocks, that is, populations of fish that are in both EU and UK waters.
520 2018-03-17 14:48:43 That's bs. So you don't believe in better background checks??! Or a ban on bump stocks?! You look the other way & "look behind the headline"when you like people like Bernie with certain policies like free college maybe? What about him voting against the Russian sanctions?
521 2018-03-17 14:48:26 What he actually does is promoting his stocks. He is well focused on that in his every appearance in the media. He has a knack in connecting every subject to one of his stock. Don't misunderstand it as tips.
522 2018-03-17 14:47:52 He never said he never met her & I don't care if he had a line out the door like JFK..This man is getting results that benefit all of us. He's standing up to the bullies, driving jobs up, stocks up, giving states back what they need to contrtol instead of gov, strong military! 
523 2018-03-17 14:47:04 Lol Crypto world is full of new investors. They buy and expect a high return in 2 months. I held penny stocks that rose to $2 in 3 years. But not all crypto or stocks move the same. HODL and Be patient. Continue on with life.
524 2018-03-17 14:45:52 Saturday morning. Good to pause. Good to reflect. Good to reset. Consider what we did right. What we did wrong. What we can do better.

533 2018-03-17 14:36:44 Where is your PROOF Trump took Russian Money for his campaign? America is a Free Market country.

What that means is Russians are free to do business in America. They buy property & U.S. Stocks like Coca Cola and Disney.

544 2018-03-17 14:31:34 One of the best decisions I ever made. I cook food so full of flavour ehn. Make amazing stocks as a great base.
545 2018-03-17 14:31:10 Saturday morning. Good to take time to review the week. What you did right. What you did wrong. What you could do better.  True about stocks. True about life. #SaturdayMorning
546 2018-03-17 14:31:00 The consequence will be the same. In 2008 most people had their money in actively managed funds that were wiped out & now it's in passive etf that buy the same few stocks that will also be wiped out for most.
547 2018-03-17 14:29:51 There are many romours about Shell having some kind of interest in QEC. It might be true and we will see in the short term. Q4 is presented at 30th mars and the Jordan feasibility study is coming before that. Ohh don’t forget about the regs lol. GL guys #QEC #stocks #obx

553 2018-03-17 14:24:53 Do you use IBD ? I did a trial found it good for stock picking powerful stocks on a breakout
554 2018-03-17 14:23:58 Real wealth in investing is made by picking small cap stocks unknown to general public which has the potential to become a big business in future and then holding that over a long period of time, say 20-30 years or else a good trader will beat your return in next 10 years.

557 2018-03-17 14:19:46 Even if you retired in 2008 — on the eve of the worst year for stocks since 1931 — in the DFA 60/40 Balanced Strategy you could have pulled 5% a year plus inflation (55% of original principal) without your balance dwindling.

Diversification and discipline trump timing or fees

The selling of stocks before tariffs. The use of WH meetings to make bank deals? Nah, it's not about America's money. His.

566 2018-03-17 14:07:54 Distinctly Unhealthy Trend in India:

A-lister Brokerages recommending B-grade stocks with
* not-so-clean management
* so-so business model
* unhealthy balance sheets w/ huge leverage.

Gullible investors may end up buying these stocks, but to what end?

@victoriouscake
567 2018-03-17 14:06:29 Liked what you used to do in the past, simply post ES_F levels/trades.  Then heard you went to individual stocks, options and were doing more commentary and not posting trades. Thats what 100s of gurus do...but if you are doing more of your traditional work, pls let me know
568 2018-03-17 14:04:28 so are you going back to ES_F trading...good amount of ES_F trades posted vs individual stocks, options and just commentary?  Like you used to in the years past?  That would be of great interest to people like me to join your chat room service

570 2018-03-17 14:00:33 The act of faith is most evident when it comes to the stock market. We have to ask ourselves, do we believe that stocks will continue to do better than bonds, and bonds will continue to do better than cash, just as they always have? #financialadvisor #investments #saturday
571 2018-03-17 13:57:49 honestly good luck to you.. I prefer the fast paced world of scalping nasdaq stocks but see the potential here.
572 2018-03-17 13:56:18 An AR15 is not functionally significantly different than a wood grain,good old fashioned, hunting rifle (from my understanding).I actually think it’s about magazines (# of bullets),bump stocks, triggers that fire on pull & release,background & mental health checks. #GunReformNow

577 2018-03-17 13:52:39 I’m very down overall at the minute in crypto, have started learning to trade a couple of tech stocks and gold. Slowly seeing what other options are out there in case the crypto market is bearish for a while. I’m about 50% down in everything I’ve put in but I trust myself 
578 2018-03-17 13:52:23 Why is it antisemitic to point out that Israel has chemical weapons stocks, refuses to ratify the chemical weapons convention and destroy its stocks, is not a member of the OPCW and refuses to declare its stocks to it? One of a handful of countries including North Korea.
579 2018-03-17 13:52:08 Best stock in otc is a term thrown around by literally every true believer for like 2000 other otc stocks. And the idea they just need to put it all together is sounding like a familiar argument to those I was making early in 2017. Its promising but delution kills all runs here.
580 2018-03-17 13:51:49 they just want to attract all kind of buyers(probably all age groups) but they are lacking stocks which again isn't fruitful for them as many are shifting to other brands!!

582 2018-03-17 13:47:51 Given that the market's down (yet again), if your 401k is invested in US stocks, it's virtually impossible for it to be "way up". Aside from that, if you're investing in CA real estate, the tax cap, will eat up any gains you may have in your 401k. Your hero screwed you Bigly!

Please post the part about turing in weapons or facing felony..

589 2018-03-17 13:40:35 I am good with things like banning bump stocks and limiting magazine size, but also think enforcing the existing laws would be wonderful too. This last shooter should have been nowhere near a gun if the LE and FBI had followed their own procedures
590 2018-03-17 13:39:21 @smerconish if I didn’t own 3 of the 4 stocks I might agree. Breakup Facebook, leave the others alone. Yes, it is all about money.

597 2018-03-17 13:35:29 Wrong - Russia NEVER manufactured Novichok. It was produced in Uzbekistan when part of the Soviet Union. Stocks were supposedly 'destroyed' by #US in 1991. It can actually be made ANYWHERE as the recipe is openly available.
598 2018-03-17 13:34:52 No idea. Point is he is the only President to follow through on it. I love the fact that he is trying to outlaw bump stocks and is pushing to raise buying age of AR to 21.

601 2018-03-17 13:28:50 I have once heard a rational experienced investor in stocks, his investment mantra is not to invest in AP companies, generaly it's a Ponzi scheme to take advantage of system,  raise capital from public, don't complete the project. 'The fly by night operators'.
602 2018-03-17 13:28:40 First of all make your stocks available
603 2018-03-17 13:28:00 Hi friends, anyone knowledgeable on stocks, trading etc. and willing to give some advice ? I’ll be your friend for like, ever...
604 2018-03-17 13:28:00 preaching tomorrow on the golden rule. Not sure 'diversity training' can be more sophisticated that 'do unto others...". I assume it's more about getting people to self-reflect that to be trained. (That, and admitting to it, is he modern equivelant of being put in the stocks)

613 2018-03-17 13:18:30 They import cod and haddock from both Norway and Iceland - comes in through Immingham. Why? Because the stocks in those fisheries are more substantial than in the N Sea, so very regular and easy supply chains and the price is attractive

616 2018-03-17 13:14:45 Not sarcasm bud.  It’s my largest holding too.  Been so for over a year.  I too “believe” but will openly admit, this relationship has felt like a second marriage when my preference for stocks is more towards casual flings.  By the end of 2018, I believe will find promised land.

621 2018-03-17 13:09:21 I thought Jeff Sessions was remaining at DOJ to lock up black & brown people, deport them & prop up prison stocks. Now having messed with Andrew McCabe, you have proved how much of a tool you are.
622 2018-03-17 13:06:47 You assume I haven't. I know, for example, that the destruction large scale stocks of Russian agents is irrelevant to their ability to deploy small amounts of them which the the article ignored.
623 2018-03-17 13:04:39 We live in the sticks but village shop and farm shop nearby. That said we keep stocks, could easily be indoors a fortnight, but menu might repeat a tad, Lots of Pasta and rice based meals I reckon!

636 2018-03-17 12:55:40 is it positive from a shareholder POV that Greatland Gold #GPP is well funded for a long time ?

649 2018-03-17 12:38:07 We hold small stocks of chemicals. Weapons is a different matter. We still put soldiers through CBRN drills but we don’t use nerve agents to do that. In 1989 it was recognised by Thatcher that CW has been eroded. Moreover no evidence that PD holds weaponised agents of that group.
650 2018-03-17 12:35:03 Behind glass doors, which employees keep walking through to their own demise... Shame! I should get rid of hose Apple stocks, they are starting to stink to high heaven.

656 2018-03-17 12:30:18 we do in fact hold small stocks of chemical weapons, primarily for research and do create new ones. we even test them on our own troops or at least we did as recently as the 90s to my knowledge

665 2018-03-17 12:12:40 That would not fly. But a gun formulary, with pellet guns on one end and ARs on the other would. Also: a stiff sin tax on ammo; banning bump stocks and clips that fire more than 8. And allowing sellers to sue for wrongful death...

691 2018-03-17 11:36:31 The sci fi thing is interesting. How much more would you say? I've always wondered why my library stocks it in the Horror section rather than with the fantasy / sci fi. It doesn't seem to have much in common with its neighbours.

696 2018-03-17 11:35:00 Is it wrong to point out that Israel has extensive chemical weapons stocks, is one of the handful of countries including North Korea which will not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, and refuses to declare its stocks to the OPCW?

716 2018-03-17 10:50:43 1 / Real estate prices rose at an unprecedented rate from the late 1990s through 2004. People seem to be buying homes like they bought stocks in the '90s - convinced that prices can only go up. Financial history does not support this conviction.

718 2018-03-17 10:49:39 I fear we are in another .com bubble. We must all invest with fundamentals in mind. The tech sector has many potentially dangerous stocks that are not built for recession. In a down turn $TSLA $GRUB and many others will go to 0... be careful people.

748 2018-03-17 10:20:24 Israel has extensive stocks of chemical weapons & refused to declare any of them to the OPCW. Israel is not a member of the OPCW. Israel signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993 but refused to ratify as this would mean inspection & destruction of its chemical weapons.

772 2018-03-17 09:47:16 Does this not worry you Dan that  Israel is yet to ratify the chemical weapons convention, hasn’t declared and destroyed its chemical weapon stocks and and hasn’t joined the OPCW, maybe it’s things like this that people point their finger at Zionists
773 2018-03-17 09:46:37 How are the Penguin stocks?
774 2018-03-17 09:43:43 Are you really that ignorant. It's the growth of industry, rising stocks, less unemployment that are all factors that lead to a higher demand of homes thus the prices rise.
I can't believe I have to actually explain this to you, well actually I do believe you need it spelled out
775 2018-03-17 09:43:24 No, at age 60+ I don't want to even understand this. Happy earning or losing in cash, delivery based.

826 2018-03-17 08:23:52 that is true. and that is literally why everyone said this was a smokebomb. a concession the nra would be willing to make because bottomline, just like banning bump stocks, it wouldn't really change anything. its like planting a tree for every hectar of rainforest mowed down.
827 2018-03-17 08:16:41 True. But when he plays the opposition has 70% plus possession which doesn’t work out too well, considering Wellington’s defensive stocks. I reckon they’re (slightly) better in this configuration.

841 2018-03-17 07:50:51 "How about"

Correct answer... How about no. 

Maybe yes on bump stocks. Although technically a bump stock is a excellent way to lose your bullets and not hit anything accurately. 

No on everything else.

923 2018-03-17 05:43:42 Bump stocks allow someone with a lot of practice to quickly squeeze the trigger. It’s still one shot per trigger squeeze. The Rifle recoils & the shooter shoves it forward again, pushing it against his trigger finger. One has to be adept to work it. Some shoot a revolver as fast.

926 2018-03-17 05:39:42 Bump stocks should be allowed to law abiding citizens. I’m not giving up any of my firearms or accessories. It’s my right and for you to try to placate Dems to try to bring the country together is throwing we conservatives under the bus. Parents need to parent their kids.
927 2018-03-17 05:39:07 It's simple. Background checks for every gun transaction. EVERY TRANSACTION. No more high capacity magazines. No bump stocks. No military grade weapons. Gun liability insurance. 

If you want to fire military style weapons, join the military. Articulate enough for you?

994 2018-03-17 03:49:20 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
995 2018-03-17 03:49:13 Also sometimes the best position to be in is the person who already paid and you can slow play it. Like the guy who got in early on a stock. But there’s no bluffing in stocks...unless you’re a frontloading lumping asshole.

1051 2018-03-17 02:38:03 Your argument fails to consider evolution and risk. Over time, there are more guns, and changes like bump stocks and large magazines increase risk. Loopholes in old regulations also increase risk.

1059 2018-03-17 02:27:59 Lol, last night, few mates, we were taking the piss out of US politics, as u do. but 1 of my mates said that exact same thing! Then some1 added, they can’t even get that right. Animals allowed in a cabin WTF! But let’s just stop overhead locker. It’s like, let’s ban bump stocks..
1060 2018-03-17 02:27:28 Taking the stocks to a NEW HIGH! 
1061 2018-03-17 02:25:47 My wife bought some stocks "I'M UP 4 CENTS TAKE THAT BITCOIN"
1062 2018-03-17 02:25:34 time to check my apple “Stocks” app. ah yes, those stocks are lookin good today! keep up the good work boys
1063 2018-03-17 02:25:31 AR 15 especially with bump stocks are not weapons that, AS PER OUR MILITARY, ordinary citizens should own.  Especially teenagers whose frontal lobe is still developing.  You want me to explain that to you?
1064 2018-03-17 02:22:20 バック・ヴォーカルには当時「キープ・オン・ダンシング」を大ヒットさせたクリオ＆ケイ*が参加しています。彼は、後の90年に、ダン・ハートマンのヒット曲「リライト・マイ・ファイヤー」をリメイクしてリリースしています。『EURO CLASSICS』JEROME STOCKS
1065 2018-03-17 02:19:44 Currently, I support banning high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, and assault weapons (which I know is an ambiguous phrase). I also support universal background checks and funding gun violence research. I know the issue is complex-these are just some gun-related solutions.
1066 2018-03-17 02:16:38 Crypto and stocks
1067 2018-03-17 02:16:21 Do you have stocks for volume 3 and 4? 
1068 2018-03-17 02:15:00 Super!! Now that's what I call a GREAT FIND! I saw their portfolio, major money in stocks!
1069 2018-03-17 02:14:38  Low-income people and other persons mentioned in law and in need of a home shall receive it gratis or for reasonable payment from the state, municipal and other housing stocks according to the norms fixed by law.
1070 2018-03-17 02:13:56 Is the AR-15 lighter, easier to move around with, easier to add bump stocks too, bigger available clips?  Must be something or why bother making it at all.
1071 2018-03-17 02:12:55 That is the cold hard fact!  Stocks started rising and hour after the announcement  that @POTUS Trump won.
1072 2018-03-17 02:08:40 One of the threats that have already been identified is assault weapons. Ban the AR-15. Ban bump stocks. There is no place and no need for these weapons in civilian life.
1073 2018-03-17 02:07:35 Then we should seriously consider outlawing leveraged buyouts along with companies buying back their own stocks.  Because an ethical bank would never lend out money to vultures like the ones that ate Toys 'R' Us.  LBO's are a failed financial theory.
1074 2018-03-17 02:06:57 It’s good. Their stocks crash then they go up. It’s a beauty cycle.
1075 2018-03-17 02:05:53 Nope. Not into power stocks because long term prospects are subject to disruptions
1076 2018-03-17 02:05:38 Likewhat? FileCoin? DAOs? SoV? No way, crypto securities are what's up. Deeds on the blockchain, digital stocks and bonds, funds managed on the chain, that's where the future is. The crypto of today is the linux of the industry. Resistance is futile. Crypto will be assimilated.
1077 2018-03-17 02:04:03 Yes, many funds held financial stocks. Taken years to recover. But those weren’t the only stocks they held. Market has risen almost 300% since then.  Tough to keep saving and invest, but it pays off...assuming your risk tolerance and goals are suited for it.
1078 2018-03-17 02:02:51 And the public stocks. Let's give them the Convict Era treatment, cat of 9 tails would also do the trick.
1079 2018-03-17 02:02:46 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1080 2018-03-17 02:01:02 I don’t understand.   You track 10 plus stocks and 5+ timeframes per stock.    How to you manage your screen.  Do you switch master timeframe?
1081 2018-03-17 02:01:02 Name one fact you can inform us with that doesn't include an opinion mentioned on Fox news or WikiLeaks. Shorting Twitter stocks because they banned you, doesn't make you feel better about the ban does it? Take another  2 hrs to reply.
1082 2018-03-17 02:00:03 #Stormy Hope you sue the snot outta Trump and affiliates! But whatever you do, donate half to charity, something like More Buns Less Assault Rifles With Bump Stocks (Guns). Good Luck

1086 2018-03-17 01:55:22 Well actually...
*I push my glasses up my nose*
I've found a relationship between pf per stocks and prospect success that I believe is significant.
1087 2018-03-17 01:54:00 @bscross32 I'm all in favor of taking bump stocks out of the market though, and getting rid of them. And yes I understand the original intent of the Second Amendment, but that being said, at least make it class 3.
1088 2018-03-17 01:53:35 The big techs need to be regulated. Banks are regulated heavily. Information is the new $. Break up FANG stocks. Increase SEC oversight.
1089 2018-03-17 01:52:51 Stocks up by 33% though.
1090 2018-03-17 01:52:22 true, and the demonizing about bump stocks too, you don't need a bump stock to bump fire a gun, you can do it with a finger lol, all you're doing is keeping your finger stationary and using the motion of the gun itself to trigger a round, could also 3D print them
1091 2018-03-17 01:50:13 When sentiment is this awful in a market (#bitcoin, stocks,), we tend to see "FIRE, ready, aim"--meaning, bitcoin is vulnerable to selloff on negative headlines.  Technicals also not strong.  Does not change positive med. or long-term picture.  Patience needed… by #dts1186
1092 2018-03-17 01:49:44 Just a general statement on what I keep seeing on stocks lately with the attitude they are all going higher.  If you like MU - great - I just see people this stock is going to $100 and they put everything into it and then all of sudden its drops 30%. I recently got burnt on BABA.
1093 2018-03-17 01:49:01 @AzCDL_Alerts dismissed us as having an 'emotional response' without 'sound judgement' 

We're old enough to understand and it's their bad judgement that's failed our generation.

Our demands are simple: 

Comprehensive Background Checks
Ban on Bump Stocks
More counselors
1094 2018-03-17 01:47:52 Been watching these stocks all day
1095 2018-03-17 01:47:25 So we have some common ground.  The NRA filed a lawsuit against Florida for their recent ban on bump stocks.  I think if both sides sat down we could agree on a lot of things. Not all - that never happens. We should try, though. It could save lives.
1096 2018-03-17 01:46:27 Strike One = Saying they don’t want poor people from India and Spain using the app.    Strike 2- Kylie Jenner basically trashing the app and making stocks nosedive 7%   Strike 3 - Approving an ad asking if you wanna hit Rihanna or Chris Brown.
Snapchat is out
1097 2018-03-17 01:46:24 Interesting note: the most-picked stock this week, $AVGO, barely moved (0.43% gain), while this week's biggest gainer chosen, $RUBI (up over 16% this week), was chosen only 3 times and propelled 2 of those who chose it to finish 1st in their brackets. #earnings #fantasy #stocks
1098 2018-03-17 01:45:17 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue
1099 2018-03-17 01:42:25 Beto supports 2nd Amend but wants to ban assault-style guns & bump stocks, have universal background checks & other common sense gun reforms. Being for 2A & common sense are not mutually exclusive & is the Democratic way. OTOH, Machine Gun Bacon Cruz & GOP: it’s all or nothing.

1102 2018-03-17 01:38:37 Yeah social media stocks fluctuate way too much tbh...
1103 2018-03-17 01:37:32 assault weapons are banned, anything over 30 round should be banned as should bump stocks
1104 2018-03-17 01:37:23 Deonta Stocks está quase voltando pro @basqueteblu. Lembrando que pode contratar somente um jogador que disputou a @NBB.
1105 2018-03-17 01:36:27 Give @RobInTheBlack a follow!!

He tweets stocks that made "INSIDE DAYS" almost daily ! 

He's a very good follow !
1106 2018-03-17 01:36:03 He sold himself to the American electorate as a smart businessman when instead it was calculated that if he invested his acquired wealth on the top 50 stocks (instead of pissing about on his failed business ventures) he'd be $6billion richer 
1107 2018-03-17 01:35:53 I have no problem with rifles.  Assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity mags, and inconsistent laws are my issue.  I don't know anyone who wants to prevent anyone from have a rifle to hunt or a gun for protection.
1108 2018-03-17 01:35:20 First full week of #Earnings League contests is in the books! Top performer was user xrolla who put up an impressive 1-week gain of 4.88% led by picks of $ARTNA and $RUBI. Thanks to #dividends, user cjwelchjr snagged the most leader points with 57 for the week. #Fantasy #stocks
1109 2018-03-17 01:34:44 Clay will short long and pass. All in the same day. Candlesticks and trends. The trend is your friend. He has no opinion on fundamentals.
1110 2018-03-17 01:31:22 Yes for the most part Dek is intraday as I am as well. Swinging stocks is really no different other than time frame. As long as my parameters for swinging are met and my risk isn’t very large it fits into the trading plan.

1113 2018-03-17 01:23:46 I rather not promote real estate to other traders as yes you can make great money, but like with crypto. It comes with risks also for those that do not know how to purchase with little or no money down.
1114 2018-03-17 01:23:15 Thank you for your honesty! It’s better to have 200,000$ in stocks and bonds. Condo does not pay any dividends plus in Canada interests are not tax deductible when you buy a condo! You pay taxes plus condo fees , you get nothing
1115 2018-03-17 01:21:23 I also remember AMZN at $5 - back then there wasn't no twitter or internet to really do stock research - I use to get the Value Line Bible which was great but who had time to go through 1600 stocks.
1116 2018-03-17 01:20:19 Hehehe I still have few stocks from langkawi beli last month  kena makan sikit2 je nnt sedih kalau abes hahahah
1117 2018-03-17 01:18:45 80/20???? Even if you circle camp like a total fucking loser it's still only 6/4 lol TL gets fucked off stage by massive disjoint and has a relatively difficult time sealing stocks on a patient DDD player who knows how to deal with bomb combos
1118 2018-03-17 01:18:11 Most 401k plans have traditional mutual funds.   These funds purchase stocks and bonds, but generally never hold the type issues you refer to. 

I work extensively in this area.  I have seen countless clients retire with a 401k being an integral part of their savings.
1119 2018-03-17 01:16:17 Hope neither one of you you two show up in Atlanta without you best driver. Golfs like stocks. Go long and strong
1120 2018-03-17 01:14:57 Well, all that law did was to make it harder to sue, even if other laws are changed. For instance, if laws banning bump stocks are in place, gun manufacturers can still make them and be legally safe in doing so.
1121 2018-03-17 01:12:48 My bump stocks were destroyed in The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 :(
1122 2018-03-17 01:12:29 Are you trying to add to the conversation, or just be a wayward distractor? Own any stocks in the Pharmaceutical companies that have poisoned so many? If you want to make a point, MAKE IT?
1123 2018-03-17 01:12:01 Kurt's a mess, the sooner he finds out the better off he'll be... he sold all his stocks in 12/16 after election he *guaranteed* would be the worst crash in history lol
1124 2018-03-17 01:07:17 ErinBur47178375 EdKrassen Technically it gives you the right to a single-shot hand-loaded, with a ball & powder, rifle that you had to manually reload before 2d shot! Not an AR to murder our kids in those same few minutes it took to load old rifle! No ARs, no bump-stocks, no…
1125 2018-03-17 01:06:58 Technically it gives you the right to a single-shot hand-loaded, with a ball & powder, rifle that you had to manually reload before 2d shot! Not an AR to murder our kids in those same few minutes it took to load old rifle! No ARs, no bump-stocks, no giant ammo clips!
1126 2018-03-17 01:05:15 You don't trade any Canadian stocks?
1127 2018-03-17 01:03:11 I am Canadian but trade US stocks. I do use stockfetcher.
1128 2018-03-17 01:00:59 As I side note, I just realized that you are from Canada as well. Just curious what screener you might use to search the Canadian stocks? I've been finding the options pretty limited compared to the ease of Finviz for the US stocks.
1129 2018-03-17 00:58:10 Ok. They don't but Treasuries. Can they but other US financial assets? Stocks, corporate bonds, commercial paper?
1130 2018-03-17 00:57:56 All this talk about whos the king of NY in? when they about to close all the ToysRus wtf  Scandles& firing over @Nike & shyt hope that dont raise the price sneakers damn! There goes my stocks! THIS SOME BS. Its going to be all kinds of inappropriate behavior that happens!
1131 2018-03-17 00:53:49 Gun show loophole has been closed? We should ban bump stocks and force gun makers not adaptable to become machine guns.
1132 2018-03-17 00:53:20 Do you have interested in chemical stocks?
1133 2018-03-17 00:53:09 A coworker asked me not too long ago if he should prioritize his student loans or start investing in stocks. I asked what his interest rate was – it's 8% – then told him it's probably not the best idea. (he did anyway lol)

1137 2018-03-17 00:47:27 Larry Kudlow said we should subsidized steel and aluminum and then he said he really doesn't know what to do
 Larry Kudlow had been working on Wall Street for many years and to think he would be a great economic advisor to Trump is laughable
His policies would keep stocks up

1142 2018-03-17 00:43:58 One of my coworkers bought bump stocks “before they ban them” as if a right to own guns and gun accessories means they should have a right to every type ever made.

1148 2018-03-17 00:36:09 NEVER defeated. The Judiciary Committee introduced its own ban on bump stocks and ghost guns. I will chair public hearing on both bills on Friday 3/23.

1151 2018-03-17 00:35:30 Morrison kepts banging on about low income earners, when they are judged that because they pay no taxes, in effect, these people have well over $1,000,000 in stocks, and are living comfortably on $130,000 a year. They don't need the extra income.
1152 2018-03-17 00:35:14 Like the experiment with the monkey doing stocktrades throwing darts at a board with stocks, and performing like any other professional stockbroker...? Anyway, this whole 45 presidency is turning into one big audaceous experiment.....
1153 2018-03-17 00:34:04 If you have some money,you try to invest to bonds  or stocks.
1154 2018-03-17 00:33:37 This week my brother taught himself how to buy and sell stocks. 

Meanwhile, I haven’t done my laundry in weeks and had to stop and buy socks. 

I feel like he’s winning.
1155 2018-03-17 00:33:19 ACTUALLY there are women here. A paying customer too. Stick to crypto and stocks because these nonsense tweets aren't adding value.
1156 2018-03-17 00:33:13 It's like saying "Why have a law against murder, since criminals will murder people anyway?"
And I get the point that there is a mental health aspect.
But my point is that common sense laws to better control tools of death are needed.
And nobody needs an AR-15 or bump stocks.
1157 2018-03-17 00:31:04 Notifications of stocks, bonds and other investments instead of likes and comments

1163 2018-03-17 00:19:00 The @GunOwners of America have never met behind closed doors to convince a president to ban bump stocks and raise legal ages just to gain more memberships. #ScrewTheNRA
1164 2018-03-17 00:18:35 Not necessarily. The few who do have money are pumping it into stocks, blindly chasing the Fed-driven bull market.
1165 2018-03-17 00:18:32 I heard that the Fed, through a Swiss bank, keeps some big Wall Street tech stocks from sinking too low, to keep the deep state going.
1166 2018-03-17 00:18:30 ->  Also irrelevant if Kazakh facility was decommissioned when bench quantities of  novichoks are all that needed for FSB assassination purposes. Same applied to old CIA pre-BWC saxitoxin stocks. Soviets bypassed that convention too; check out Sverdlovsk anthrax incident.b ->
1167 2018-03-17 00:12:30 Stocks are earnings based - biggest corporate tax cut in decades coupled with 90% regulations gone that stifle profits and growth=30k Dow.
1168 2018-03-17 00:12:27 You got enough people out there eyeing the 200day in things and throwing in bids, the stocks gonna bounce. No idea why people write off moving averages like they cant act as support. All support is is places where buying >selling.
1169 2018-03-17 00:12:00 Now is the time to buy stocks in Kleenex. #JustSayin
1170 2018-03-17 00:10:40 I think it is similar to the idea of bump stocks, it makes it easier to kill, depending on the situation. Imagine if the Vegas shooter had a firearm that not only had a bump stock, but a silencer for said firearm?

1175 2018-03-17 00:08:14 Ban bump stocks. Expand background checks and create a national database. What is wrong with this country? How is this even an issue? Such a dark and sad time. So sad.

1180 2018-03-17 00:01:40 Absentee ownership is a big reason I like the idea of eminent domaining unoccupied housing stocks and incorporating it into NYCHA. Also maybe have the city buyup % of new stock instead of negotiating for afford. housing with a lottery for distribution. Regardless, huge backlog

1183 2018-03-18 23:59:24 There’s no difference between an AR-15 and other rifles. Banning bump stocks doesn’t stop anything. Stricter background checks wouldn’t have stopped any of the recent shootings...
1184 2018-03-18 23:57:55 If I’m not mistaken, flows into ETFs are none of the 3 categories charted here. So it’s outflows from single stocks, inflows into ETFs, as well as buybacks
1185 2018-03-18 23:57:54 My point, my illustrious colleague, is that NO ONE is using fully automatic weapons. I’m as against bump stocks as you probably are, but an AR-15 is not an automatic weapon. If you guys focus your argument, you’ll probably get further.

1241 2018-03-18 23:19:16 Look at it this way, if you buy a plain looking truck and you want it tricked out you can do it and nobody will say anything. But if you take a mini 14 and trick it out. Oh my god it's become an assault rifle.Bump stocks are a joke, you"still" have to pull the trigger every time
1242 2018-03-18 23:18:03 I guess you prefer shady financial planners/stock brokers who steer people stocks/products that they make huge commissions from that are often poor performers, have high annual fees, and people lose money.  Regulations were meant to stop this. Total disclosure, and transparency
1243 2018-03-18 23:17:41 That's not true at all. Republicans want Mueller fired. He's bad for business. Stock market has been all green. Fire Mueller today watch stocks sore.
1244 2018-03-18 23:14:39 It most certainly is not the best answer. In fact it’s fucking stupid. And the citizens will not be unarmed. Minus bump stocks, semi automatic rifles, and maybe they won’t be able to trot up to the store and get a gun within 15 minutes but they will not be unarmed.

1261 2018-03-18 22:59:22 Could care less about bump stocks. We have back ground checks. When they fail, it is normally a government agency that failed. If we draft at 18 and train them to use them, when they come home are we telling our fighters we don't trust them on American soil till they are 21.

1264 2018-03-18 22:57:13 Banning bump stocks will have no effect in preventing mass shootings; particularly in deadly gun-free zones. Knee-jerk reactions will not solve the problem that needs solving; intelligent ppl realize that. City of Denver doesn't get it; not surprised that they're 'shocked'.

1314 2018-03-18 21:43:51 Its open 24 hours for 5 days dude. Stocks is only open from 9-5 lol
1315 2018-03-18 21:42:58 I see a bright future in popcorn stocks. @OrvillePopcorn #Resistance
1316 2018-03-18 21:39:27 Well the pos Cruz didn't even have a bump stock tho. and bump stocks are still only one round every trigger pull. It's still a semi automatic rifle. no matter what people wanna say. That's why under obama they weren't outlawed.
1317 2018-03-18 21:39:21 0. They just funnel millions and millions of dollars into buying elected officials and blocking laws meant only to keep its citizens safe while generating propaganda to scare people into thinking that a ban on oh...say bump stocks is trampling 2A. There is some culpability there
1318 2018-03-18 21:35:54 Cfp has saved fish stocks
1319 2018-03-18 21:35:52 And you sold off stocks before an economic crash with some help they must be so proud of your positions on immigrants and people who need help
1320 2018-03-18 21:32:54 I understand that this material is available in Israel, Russia and UK..assuming too that other owners have declared their stocks. The evidence re source is not hard I think which is worrying.

1323 2018-03-18 21:28:02 I’m a female director!
1324 2018-03-18 21:27:46 Had also read somewhere that all the stocks of the poison were dumped in the Black Sea and that Ukraine had found them and subsequently used the agent in the UK to further discredit Russia . 
No end to the spin .
1325 2018-03-18 21:27:08 I didn't mind the idea of dying young until I realised I've never had my own pet and now I'm like... *stocks up on vitamins and throws away cigarettes*
1326 2018-03-18 21:26:31 What's important I think is not where are but where we have come from. The rise in exports and domestic consumption since the early estimates has taken down ending stocks and eroded a lot of the NC buffer stock.
1327 2018-03-18 21:25:10 Juice isn't good for you either. Walgreens stocks plenty of bottled water.
1328 2018-03-18 21:21:16 Then you have lost control of your nerve stocks?

1331 2018-03-18 21:18:57 When Donald Trump goes to prison part of his restitution should be that he is put into the old-time stocks and everybody gets to form a line and one swift kick to his ass, I am guessing that line would be thousands of miles long and I would be wearing my hardest pointy shoes
1332 2018-03-18 21:17:28 You’re supposed to be a journalist. You should know this is true.

How can you NOT know the OPCW confirmed #Russia destroyed all its CW stocks in 2017?

How can you NOT know the #USA hasn't done so yet (also according to the OPCW)?

You have a duty to INFORM, not propagandise
1333 2018-03-18 21:15:42 What happened to your pledge to raise age to 21 for rifles and eliminate bump stocks? You are a spineless demagogue!
1334 2018-03-18 21:14:50 Irrational behavior from investors. Without even knowing whether anyone is really going to delete profile they sell. Great long entry possibility for smart investors. Even though, Dont think that many smart investors in #snapchat anyway. #stocks
1335 2018-03-18 21:13:23 1. Profiting-he passed his billion $ business to his kids.  He takes zero salary from the government.  Is he suppose to just get rid of what he built to be Pres?  He wasn't a a career politician like all the rest.

1336 2018-03-18 21:08:00 I now install Oxygen 2.2.2 and cannot Boot in to Recoverymode it stocks at the 1+ bootlogo :(
1337 2018-03-18 21:06:15 This applies to very select group of stocks but at times with proper conditions can also work with broader based plays. Micro cap OTC and some ETN/F can run up and down like this all day. planning before entering a position Is key ! You killing it lately
1338 2018-03-18 21:05:09 I personally don't care about bump stocks, but I think it's absolutely hilarious that they think people are going to willfully turn in stocks which have no serial numbers.
1339 2018-03-18 21:05:03 Stocks to Watch: MDB, PETX, COH. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
1340 2018-03-18 21:03:52 The biggest risks:

Debt being used recklessly

Valuations don’t matter. Growth is key and profitability will come

Book values are old fashioned

Stocks can only go up. Corrections and bear markets don’t last long.

If you invest in index funds, you will do well.
1341 2018-03-18 21:03:13 Cheat day
1342 2018-03-18 21:01:04 They should put them all in the middle of Telford in stocks and let the parents do as they please with them
1343 2018-03-18 20:57:50 So where does this sit with @RuthDavidsonMSP earlier tweet today saying that the UK must protect rights to fish stocks and vessels.  Very fishy (so to speak).

1347 2018-03-18 20:56:06 The perception the government is trying to create with franking credits is that somehow full pensioners on 21,000 a year have shares in stocks with mysterious windfalls. Not bloody likely. #auspol #TheProjectTV
1348 2018-03-18 20:52:24 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1351 2018-03-18 20:49:22 Also, to benefit from harvesting he would have sold stocks for gains he was looking to offset?
1352 2018-03-18 20:49:04 Not a chance. My 401K..IRA..stocks/bonds..paycheck every 2 weeks is bleeding money.  I love him. Want more & more.
1353 2018-03-18 20:47:23 How can anyone who has stocks in savings want this to pass.  I just gives a green light for the government to steal their money.
1354 2018-03-18 20:46:57 #Putin responding to #UK Skripal claims: learned from the media; had it been the military nerve agent, victims wld’ve been dead; #Russia destroyed all its CW stocks; the timing is most damaging to us. But we are open to constructive engagement with #UK (repeated 3 times)
1355 2018-03-18 20:46:54 Well then let me formally introduce myself Mr. Weatherman.  My name is Average Joe.  How the heck should I be allocating my money saved for the future if stocks bonds etc is equivocal to blackjack in your opinion?
1356 2018-03-18 20:46:19 Now that he's had time to hide his stocks, he'll probably invite the UN to inspect his facilities. How transparent is this guy?
1357 2018-03-18 20:45:43 May Facebook's stocks collapse.
1358 2018-03-18 20:44:15 He bit his lip softly. “I..guess maybe the stocks would be appropriate.”
1359 2018-03-18 20:43:07 @sisSoftware do you have a system set up for options trading on stocks?
1360 2018-03-18 20:41:56 Hundreds of nukes, massive military, stocks of nerve gas and bioweapons plus smallpox, Polonium and you think it makes a difference what they got from Syria..?
1361 2018-03-18 20:41:41 CBOT May wht down A$2.78/t as recent rally unravels. Funds turned sellers against large global stocks, poor US exports and rains forecast for Kansas.
1362 2018-03-18 20:41:37 What is real money? They have to decide if the trust the dollar or the crypto more to work for them. What happens if we do get inflation? Maybe we already have  inflation. Companies are buying back stocks instead of paying of debt.
1363 2018-03-18 20:41:23 What are your settings on TOS for scanning? Like what criteria stocks are you looking for on their system, if you don’t mind me asking.

1365 2018-03-18 20:40:19 Of course but until gun control is passed by the leftist nationally & the government tries to confiscate them from my cold dead body only an imbecile would turn in their weapons &/or accessories to the police when a ban issued city or state wide but in this case it's bump stocks.

1368 2018-03-18 20:38:32 I would like to see how many Facebook executives dumped their stocks on Friday knowing what was coming down the pike?
1369 2018-03-18 20:36:22 I’m willing to sacrifice my happiness and sanity for the good of the majority. Just remember me when I die from stress after being edgeguarded by holding A for 3 straight stocks.

1372 2018-03-18 20:33:25 J 60% of my investments are still in stocks & IRAs so my 40% in crypto & 50% of that is gains over 4 yrs in bitcoin can ride the risky road of the bear market  until the bulls  push my gains to the  moon 
1373 2018-03-18 20:33:24 #DayTrading strategy is very simple.  Identify stocks that are moving higher and capture a move in price in the direction I am supporting.  Looking for consistent singles with tight stops.  Avoid big losses.

1375 2018-03-18 20:32:14 I've done freelance SEO and SEM and I refuse to work for sites that are predatory, like penny stocks, ad farms, etc. I've also refused direct orders from managers to use spam email lists in marketing campaigns. I lost one job because of it.

1377 2018-03-18 20:29:06 Hey Jim if we are lucky you will drop stocks in Twitter and close this account too. The only true evil in this world comes from you and the actors guild. It’s a shame you used to be one of my favorites.
1378 2018-03-18 20:27:59 Not? *huffing lightly, making a pout* The stocks so
1379 2018-03-18 20:25:50 my life goal is to major in something with math or science, get into stocks, buy my dream car, and live by the beach with my dog
1380 2018-03-18 20:23:28 Agree with your comment.  IBD must have gone mad.  The reality is that there aren't that many good companies.  It pays to stick with the best rather than jump around in lower quality stocks.  IBD confuses trading with investing: you are either a trader or an investor.
1381 2018-03-18 20:23:24 Of course Google wasn't selling bump stocks -- it was a third party via Google Shopping. Similarly, Facebook wasn't giving data to Cambridge Analytica. If I read Liz's tweet correctly, she was criticizing FB for not monitoring the actions of third parties on their platform.
1382 2018-03-18 20:22:59 A real world analogy for the #crypto massacre.

Say you are long term bullish on the world economy and own a lot of stocks.

And then the 3rd world war starts.

What do you do?
1383 2018-03-18 20:22:47 One thing I've noticed in crypto compared to stocks is, twitter is a big factor when it comes to prices.
1384 2018-03-18 20:21:54 The use of technology to filter a watchlist of stocks that you feel comfortable trading is a huge step in becoming an independent trader. I use primarily Finviz for screening and scan with Thinkorswim. Twitter friends have great ideas too providing they screen for fundamentals.
1385 2018-03-18 20:21:46 Good for stocks

1388 2018-03-18 20:15:42 That is unlikely to please #OPCW who turn up tomorrow. They declared in 2017 that ALL Russian stocks of chemical weapons had been destroyed. So is Boris accusing them of lying.????

1392 2018-03-18 20:12:08 #opportunity A list of stocks to buy, hold and sell is available - for free. As well as some research on stocks I predict will grow 100%+ within the next six months.

1394 2018-03-18 20:09:17 This is just playing into people's ignorance when you know better..
First of all, it would be monetizing if the bonds were immediately retired upon purchase. But the treasury must still repay the fed the bond.
Second of all, what would your rather have them buy? Stocks?
1395 2018-03-18 20:09:09 UPDATE:Twitter reader @richfreed has an explanation that might explain this: Ryan's accountant appears to have been "harvesting losses"--a tax minimization strategy--while maintaining exposure to bank stocks: 1/
1396 2018-03-18 20:08:43 Incredible to think that @PutinRF_Eng has been in charge for 18 years already, yet his economy and conventional military are both still laughing stocks.

1397 2018-03-18 20:08:26 Davis, i dont follow...can u please clarify what do your trade, stocks or options every day. I see ur results u send out daily, so it must be stocks..so if u can clarify...I don't care what u trade, i just want to make some money.
1398 2018-03-18 20:07:58 Bump stocks: no function other allowing a shooter to fire more bullets/minute for no legit purpose I can see. AR-15 style rifles: designed to kill humans, not for hunting, so why are they available? All gun owners and their weapons should be cleared, trained, and licensed.
1399 2018-03-18 20:07:30 I love fish and chips, so a welcome decision.
Fishing needs controlling over a wide area as fish migrate as they don't respect maritime borders. 
Quotas were brought in after fish stocks were in critical decline from overfishing, when fishermen could take whatever they wanted.
1400 2018-03-18 20:07:12 Yes, and especially the casino selling “investment opportunities.” Even better if Joe is threatened with violence if he looks for a better place to invest (accredited investor laws). 

The casino is Wall Street and publicly traded stocks, bonds, etc.

1402 2018-03-18 20:06:43 No @Recode, $TWTR is up for one simple reason: it’s being accumulated. Stocks are not priced for what a company is worth today, so let’s stop pretending that what is KNOWN today, is what should dictate future moves in price.
1403 2018-03-18 20:05:44 Because they're being exploited and put on display by the left who have no reasoned and sensible arguments. All liberals say is we have to "do something."  Former President Os administration approved the sale of bump stocks. Why didn't they do "something" when he had both houses?

1411 2018-03-18 19:50:34 I know. The military version is the fully automatic AR-16. However, bump stocks turn the AR-15 from semi- to nearly fully-automatic rifle.
1412 2018-03-18 19:47:40 Stocks to Watch: AMZN, PETX, SQ. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
1413 2018-03-18 19:47:10 It is what I get for rapid typing in hurry.  I meant to say bump stocks on AR15 or other guns.  Yes I know AR15s function the same way.
1414 2018-03-18 19:45:32 Oh I don’t think the critique of “google used to sell bump stocks” is invalid. Again whether or not the employees wanted that or not doesn’t negate the impact. It’s more an observation that it’s going to entrench the targets of that critique rather than convert.
1415 2018-03-18 19:45:30 Bump stocks have been used in one shooting, and they will probably be banned. Hand guns are killing more every year than semi automatic rifles are.
1416 2018-03-18 19:42:12 So with that in mind, you would be OK, by you’re own admission, that Restrictions Should be Eliminated for rifles With 3-Round-Burst capability (4 Law Abiding Folks) as an Even-Steven Trade for Restricting Bump Stocks (4 Safety)?? I for one would be on board with that one. 
1417 2018-03-18 19:40:36 Wait to buy and sell stocks, unless your stop is crossed
1418 2018-03-18 19:39:54 1)It is not the job of lawmakers including @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr to better themselves financially by selling stocks after inside tips or protecting China for benefit of your wife’s company and your children’s bank accnts.
1419 2018-03-18 19:39:43 And now that I say that, it’s easy to say I’m keeping it not personal when up huge. During the big dip, I wasn’t. Almost told buddy to F off when he was bugging me about stocks being down.

1422 2018-03-18 19:37:35 Yet it is considered prudent to invest in s&p 500 index funds even tho the average person does NOT have insight into the underlying stocks unknown by the general market. Why is this investing and not gambling based on that logic? #Bitcoin

1430 2018-03-18 19:26:19 @JohnBrennan So banning bump stocks will prevent school shootings? Clearly you are an absolute buffoon. How about the complete meltdown of FBI and local law enforcement.  Excuse me but your political agenda is showing. ASS HAT
1431 2018-03-18 19:25:30 Investing is when you have insight unknown by the market in general.

Gambling is when you do not.

1439 2018-03-18 19:15:03 A part of the reason for the slow m2 adoption is the lack of dividends, nobody wants to have to sell $btc to make profit when you own stocks and bonds etc that generate income.. through staking PoS could help that adoption a lot.
1440 2018-03-18 19:14:46 I’m well aware of the factors like adrenaline, stress, etc. play in an incident, which is precisely why having bump stocks should be prohibited.  Tendency is to spray instead of aim. 
Same reason the M16 ditched full auto for 3 round burst.

1442 2018-03-18 19:12:56 @TMLTrader $BABA technically one of the strongest stocks on my screen, I bought recently in the high $180s initially looking to sell at new high. Now looks a lot like $NFLX on  run from $220 to $320, I think it can make a move to $230-250 #investing #trading #China #TomsTruths

1448 2018-03-18 19:07:35 And I agree about conversion kits and bump stocks. Any parts like that should be regulated more since they allow people to break the rules already in place.

1458 2018-03-18 19:01:57 Wrong. They were never "banned". The so called 'ban' involved flash hiders, magazine capacity, and collapsible stocks. In addition, pre/post 'ban' rifles were available for sale at gun shows and on the open market, as were pre-ban high capacity magazines. Facts matter.

1462 2018-03-18 18:59:14 FWIW, the reason I'm selling stock instead of bitcoin, is because the stocks I'm selling are RSUs granted to me by my employer. When they vest the company takes taxes out at that time. So, since the taxes have already been taken out, no reason not to sell them.
1463 2018-03-18 18:58:31 Nobody but gun enthusiasts knew about bummp stocks until that idiot in Las Vegas. Bump stocks are not really that useful, and you can bump fire a rifle without any accessories. Banning them would just be theeatrical.
1464 2018-03-18 18:57:03 Seeing $BTC where it’s at now and the entire crypto market down, I’m glad I pulled out with 70% gains. Would’ve had a $32k+ profit had I speculated when I given the tip to do so, but I’m glad I cashed out. Stocks 5 days a week is more of my thing
1465 2018-03-18 18:56:52 That's a solid plan considering stocks have had an amazing bull run themselves. Just don't go all in on any one asset class is my advice. Keep plenty of both assets along with lots of cash so once a real crash arrives cash can acquire more of any asset class you want more of.
1466 2018-03-18 18:55:26 Yeah! This is all the beginning! Imagine those who sold BTC in its first big dip! Same for mostly Stocks... Just enjoy the ride and think long.
1467 2018-03-18 18:53:50 Sorry. Hit the wine a little today. The cat scratched me after a visit to castle Bran where Vlad was possibly imprisoned or stayed for a few days??He’s a bit like George Washington there. “Slept here, impaled some people over there...”Your poor cat Lol To the stocks, kitty!

1485 2018-03-18 18:37:10 It sounds correct. To my understanding based on the dynamics of wheat stocks relatively last season, the ending wheat stocks are very likely to be between 14.5-15.0 mmt.
1486 2018-03-18 18:36:58 Anyone holding Facebook stock in their 401Ks and portfolios should be prepared for a drop. Or if you’re really smart, dump your position at the market open. @SRuhle @AliVelshi #Zuckerberg #Facebook cambridge #Facebook #stocks #MSNBC #cnbc

1494 2018-03-18 18:31:34 I think you need to stop looking at things from a data standpoint and realize that most people who have entered a dubs bracket have shared the common experience of getting throw -> finishing touched for half their stocks. Makes tons of ppl not enter/take it seriously
1495 2018-03-18 18:31:00 You have it backwards the NRA wants next to nothing done about the problems. They oppose background checks at private shows they don't think there should be legislation for bump stocks and they still have not ever shown a legitimate reason why anyone needs to own an assault rifle

1506 2018-03-18 18:24:02 @sizov_andre SOVECON estimate of record Russian #wheat stocks is projected at 20.6 mmt (+48% above 2017). USDA is 13.8 Mmt. The actual number might be somewhere in between (?) & the LOCATION of these stocks is also important. I recall difficulties in buying  in June ‘17 at Novo
1507 2018-03-18 18:23:15 Yes, the remaining stocks will be far from export channels. But they are (highly) likely to be involved in export deliveries as well thanks to preferential rail tariff for regions located far from the sea ports.

1520 2018-03-18 18:10:22 I disagree.  Some stocks are worth waiting out, especially dividend stocks and cost averaging will make you money over the long term.  This is a short term/swing trading strategy.

1524 2018-03-18 18:07:40 One of the biggest factors behind fall in the prices of

2) ITC

is government policies - which is pro poor - trying to control prices of medicines, advertisement against tobacco

1535 2018-03-18 17:59:13 I believe it's true the U.K. gov't has evidence Russia has stocks of Novichok. What form of evidence they have is crucial. If it's hearsay from intel, that may prove embarrassing when they are required to produce the evidence for OPCW.
1536 2018-03-18 17:58:33 Ryan is silent because he's complicit in Russia.  Did you see where he sold stocks in banks after being in a hearing with insider info?  Yeah, he's as dirty as your boy Don the Con. maga my ass.
1537 2018-03-18 17:56:17 Unfortunately, at the time it wasn’t illegal. Obama changed that $hit, though. Not that any of these clowns care about laws and ethics. I wonder if Ryan felt ANY guilt dumping those stocks while so many had no idea what was about to happen.
1538 2018-03-18 17:55:54 Still 4% of stocks extant worldwide.  Also any monitoring organisation can only work on declared items. If items were removed prior to declaring stockpiles then their destruction cannot be certified.

1555 2018-03-18 17:43:10 There is much debate on the Russian wheat  ending stocks. You (Sovecon) say they’ll be around 20 million carryover at the end of the season. IKAR says 19 million mt — USDA says 13.5 Mmt. These low on farm stocks show that the remaining stocks will be far from export channels.
1556 2018-03-18 17:42:47 There was no LTCG on stocks compared to Bank FD,debt MF,gold and real estate. So the investment environment gets skewed. Those who invest in stocks must be confident that they can show their money as legal.

1567 2018-03-18 17:26:12 If so, it's a pretty shitty lack of moral leadership. All they have to do is require moc to have financial advisors, which I a$$ume mo$t of them do.
Furthermore, their financial advisors should be bound by ethics laws ensuring moc can't directly meddle with their stocks.
1568 2018-03-18 17:25:59 Totally useless info. They just used current events of $gern just so they can get people to subscribe and read about their other stocks.  That piece by the fool is just blah. Lol
1569 2018-03-18 17:25:11 Don't buy anything.  Don't go on vacation or spend any more money than you have to.  Sell stocks.  Pull as much cash out of the bank as you can.  Call in sick or take a staycation.  Drive below the speed limit on the freeway during rush hour.  Put up signs over the freeway, etc.

Does he want universal background checks?
Or raising the age to buy ALL firearms?
Or outlaw bump stocks? 
Or any or all of the above, or what?

1579 2018-03-18 17:14:48 I had very few stocks, barely $300 worth. And I sold them the day after the election was stolen.
I will participate in a general strike. I will protest, march, make phone calls, register voters, canvass, and volunteer. Just like I've been doing all year.

1586 2018-03-18 17:09:44 Money in stocks is money lent to productive people to build and make things, including consumer goods,creating all the world’s jobs along the way. What the lender gets back is a share if the company does well, and nothing if it does not.
1587 2018-03-18 17:09:36 Thanks for your help. I am sad that Nike have stopped making the Fuelband which I have loved. Do you have any residual stocks
1588 2018-03-18 17:09:28 So much garbage and noise. So much regulatory risk that will evolve into enforcement. Smart money never picks penny stocks. Smart technologists never try to get rich quick.
1589 2018-03-18 17:08:42 I hear ya but I appreciate that perspective. We just need to know that good nh in. I’m having a hard time seeing the confidence levels so high. His firm sells gold/silver and foreign stocks. Everybody votes from where they sit, right?

1595 2018-03-18 17:06:25 Okay. I went back and checked... I stand corrected. Congress IS exempt from this law.
That is the one of the most ASININE things I've ever heard of!
That means it's legal for them to make laws for profit! Because Congress writes the laws that can project the trajectory of stocks.

1614 2018-03-18 16:52:10 UK Ambassador Adams last year congratulated OPCW on destruction of Russia’s chemical weapons stocks, without single hint/reservation of undeclared or secret stocks.

1616 2018-03-18 16:50:05 Look at this paragraph:
UK: Russia is official successor state to USSR..so Russia legally took responsibility for ensuring tCWC applies to all former Soviet Chemical Weapons stocks and facilities.

1622 2018-03-18 16:47:56 This could be an example of over-classification, because on the research side, all this was open, if hazy knowledge.

More concrete data began to come in as US troops helps destroy chemical stocks in newly-independent CIS states such as Uzbekistan in the late 90s and early 2000s.

1643 2018-03-18 16:34:13 Who’s crying. I support classifying Bump stocks as full auto and fixing the NICS.  So does the NRA. I support School Marshal programs.  Looks like all that’s happening. I don’t mind others having an AR15 either. Too small for me though,I like the AR10 much better.

1645 2018-03-18 16:32:53 Is the best defense against rising inflation an allocation to value stocks? History says yes:

1966-1982
20-YR Bonds = 4.4%
Inflation (CPI) = 6.8%
S&P 500 = 6.8%
5-YR T-Notes = 7.0%
1-Mo T-Bills = 7.1%

DFA US Large Value Index = 11.0%
DFA US Small Value Index = 16.0%
1646 2018-03-18 16:32:32 I believe the age to purchase firearms should be raised, that bump stocks should be banned, it shouldn't be easy for people to get their hands on assault rifles.
1647 2018-03-18 16:32:12 Completely agree! It all comes down to cycles. I just feel for those who are being pushed into stocks at these levels. At the end of the day, many lives are affected by how many numbers they have in their bank account.

1677 2018-03-18 16:09:03 Obama's economy wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I'd say it was good. Jobs were being created, unemployment was going down, and stocks were going up. That all didn't magically start happening with Trump.
1678 2018-03-18 16:08:14 Difference between Own #Conviction vs Borrowed Conviction

Own conviction - You buy #stocks and they starts going down, you look #opportunities to accumulate more

Borrowed conviction - You buy a stock and it starts going down, you get scared & look for opportunities to exit.

For cryptos, I am fancied by the idea of trading it but not investing.
1689 2018-03-18 15:55:33 Of course it’s the very rare person that can pick the top performing stocks. A cheap S&P index fund will beat almost every active investor over time.
1690 2018-03-18 15:54:57 I can honestly say I’ve never been the victim of a scam.  I’m invested in some great stocks that I’m very positive about. But I don’t need to shill them for their value to go up.
1691 2018-03-18 15:54:35 Kahn:’undervalued stocks can remain underpriced indefinitely. We ask ourselves what the catalysts are that can turn these fallen companies’
1692 2018-03-18 15:54:23 No doubt, we are better off, inflation down, property prices down, corruption down, good returns on investment in mutual fund and stocks, affordable traveling, overall feeling better if you do not involve in politics..
1693 2018-03-18 15:53:59 lol u know me better than that ! 
 I am talking stocks and crypto and bulls and bears ! haha  what is Mach madness 
1694 2018-03-18 15:53:47 Senator:  I know Socialists don’t understand markets; but 50% of Americans own stocks as part of their retirement savings.  Stock buy back’s raise share prices, which is also good for average Americans.  Not the evil you see. JM
1695 2018-03-18 15:51:41 Amazing “innocent” timing of stock sales! Just like Price’s purchase of health care stocks. This is why most members of Congress leave substantially richer than when they were elected.
1696 2018-03-18 15:50:07 Yey! They can transfer stocks from other branches afaik if they don't have it :)
1697 2018-03-18 15:49:47 Bonne question :-) le taux d’adoption est très faible dans nos métiers alors on vide les stocks d’IPV4 LEGACY dispo sur le marché et le client est prêt à payer pour ça. Sur scaleway par exemple l’ipv4 est optionnelle l’instance coûte moins cher (-0,99) dans ce cas.
1698 2018-03-18 15:48:49 Stay and move to manc then. Get motivated
1699 2018-03-18 15:48:34 These people should be forced to divest of stocks before entering office.

1701 2018-03-18 15:45:48 So how does this equate in jobs gained, and labor increases? How were these profits converted, or did they get reinvested in stocks. Did the rich merely gets richer, while the remainder of Americans were forced to eat the scraps that fell to the floor?
1702 2018-03-18 15:45:39 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your autism
1703 2018-03-18 15:45:01 Pourriez vous me faire un petit pull  ça ne se verra pas dans les stocks 
1704 2018-03-18 15:43:31 #Gambling is a binary decision with a binary result.  #Stocks is not gambling.  The game goes on forever, your 'bets' can be binary but the result never is.  Invest in good, long term companies and you cannot lose money over the long term.
1705 2018-03-18 15:40:18 French are scared to even own a few stocks, unsurprisingly bitcoin is unimaginable for them.

1708 2018-03-18 15:36:30 What may I ask unemployment and stocks are now? Better or worse after 1 year compared to 8 years of Obama’s?
1709 2018-03-18 15:35:02 We don’t have to agree but you make me smile with your defence of it all. I have to admire that kind of passion. I do remember unemployment at double digits when obama came in. 4.6 when he left
Stocks were 8000 2008 and 19000 Jan 20 2017.  Obama did well

1711 2018-03-18 15:34:19 Read the legislation they were trying to pass.  It wasn't just bump stocks.  How can you be that misinformed?
1712 2018-03-18 15:33:35 Everyone quick to defend someone nicknamed ‘Big Baby’. I just think it’s curious a guy who’s been thought of as immature and not having a great/lucrative career would be traveling with $92,000 cash. But hey maybe he’s just keeping up with his stocks! 
1713 2018-03-18 15:33:34 Anand bhai , any such midcap that we can research ? whats your take on carbon stocks like graphite , heg ?
1714 2018-03-18 15:32:18 You haven’t told us what the benefits to British fishermen are, and the fishing stocks have risen since we are in EU, due to quota that all EU states adhere to, without them, we wouldn’t have a fishing industry, which is mostly owned by non Brits anyway. PS
1715 2018-03-18 15:30:08 Almost every offshore worker I meet that invests risk their money in the penny stocks, O&G, miners .. all the crap from @LondonSouthEast east hot chat topics.  Boast to everyone their knowledge. But when challenged I realise they don’t have a clue.

1723 2018-03-18 15:22:38 Just curious, when you sold your bank stocks back in 2008, did thoughts of insider trading ever cross your mind?  Maybe Randy Bryce should look into it. @IronStache
1724 2018-03-18 15:20:27 It’s possible that many states may have some, but none have ever declared stocks of it to @OPCW, and none has ever been found - including by OPCW in Russia or anywhere else.
1725 2018-03-18 15:18:22 Thank you!

1727 2018-03-18 15:17:38 There is no international agreement that gives UK 100% !!! It can never happen. For decades the politicians and (subsidised boat owners) blamed the EU for everything.

There is no way to exclude others, we don't have the navy, we can only negotiate & protect stocks.

He’s not an @NRA member.

1753 2018-03-18 14:55:23 Good morning - quick question with no right answer (best kind).. do you have an opinion on the ratio of physical gold to gold stocks one should hold?  Example: if 10% of my portfolio is “gold”.... what mix?  As an investor I lean toward more stock (maybe 70/30 mix). Thanks 
1754 2018-03-18 14:54:16 The man in the mirror only bought those stocks. If he is convinced that he should sell, he ll sell. No need of standing in front of mirror. Problem is that he ll not be convinced only. Biases!!

“Yes.”

Info from Forbes so I’m not just making it up.

1823 2018-03-18 13:59:33 this is an indirect way of bringing up the "smash 4 should be 3 stocks" conversation
1824 2018-03-18 13:56:59 Pourquoi limiter les stocks dans ces cas là?
1825 2018-03-18 13:56:27 Since our Great President came into Office, ISIS is basically gone, unemployment is down, tax breaks for EVERY American, 1.8 Dreamers would be allowed in this Country, oh and he's working towards actual measures to remove Bump stocks.  Yet, he's a terrible President?

1827 2018-03-18 13:54:15 Most Americans don't care what POTUS did before his election. We care about the country. Stocks are up, unemployment is down, consumer confidence is the highest it's been in 14 years. What's your problem. P.S. this is not a personality contest. Think about it.
1828 2018-03-18 13:53:17 But with skin in the game, right? Otherwise you are no better than "analysts" who predict absurd prices for tech stocks or Bitcoin.

1830 2018-03-18 13:52:31 Even though Ryan probably sold his stocks based on non-public information, the info didn’t come directly from the company he owned shares.

1833 2018-03-18 13:51:12 Like look you imbecile, there are people out there that have lost up to 30 AND more grand because they went into such territory without knowing what they're doing.
The company still has their stocks and those people who invested don't own any more of it.
1834 2018-03-18 13:50:35 How long before we get there official statement that @NahuPicks and @RayCotolo will not be selling bump stocks and auto rifles. It just seems to be the trend ya know

1848 2018-03-18 13:43:18 Mind well, FEB and March are months of adjustments. Many corporate, FII, DII, HNI's are occupied for churning stocks for settling of short term capital gains, business profits as the case may be. The next rally starts with 7 th APRIL as funding will re open.

1869 2018-03-18 13:22:55 “The ban on bump stocks approved by the city council in January was considered largely symbolic.”  That’s probably why there hasn’t been any turned in...or nobody owned one to begin with.

1962 2018-03-18 11:54:00 You have not lost anything. Your investments have the ability to revive themselves in the moment's notice. These are not stocks and shares. And these companies are not going bankrupt. They have millions in their coffers from ICOs and pumps. This situation is temporary.

1964 2018-03-18 11:51:08 Banning bump stocks and high capacity mags is not as broad, and in my opinion is not an unreasonable restriction. What would these restrictions do for gun owners? They would have to reload their rifles more often, and could not shoot rounds consecutively.
1965 2018-03-18 11:48:21 Does anyone seriously believe that the chemists at Porton Down are not capable of analysing and synthesising a whole range of nerve agents? I would be amazed if the don't keep small stocks of all nerve agents as analytical standards of reference. But use them? NO.

3.Russia demands a sample so it can make a forensic comparison.

2006 2018-03-18 11:07:34 Instead of owning individual stocks on their own, you can own entire indexes. (Ex: S&P 500). I think something like 95% (ish) of people that invest on their own into individual stocks, underperform the market on average.

2013 2018-03-18 10:59:21 Yeah okay. I have no position either way. Currently don't own any Li or Co stocks but I know Africa is a tricky place to invest and do business. A 8% increase in taxes has to hurt the bottom line either way. Some SHs burry their head in the sand though and not recommended imo.

2015 2018-03-18 10:55:42 I don't think you've read it. If you did you'd seen he was backing what the PM had said - ie either directly supplied by Russia or they lost control of their stocks. That line has been consistent ever since. 
I still wait for evidence from you where he has denied it was Russia

2017 2018-03-18 10:55:25 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

2025 2018-03-18 10:42:16 Surely the question @AndrewMarr9 etc al should've asked those saying Russia weren't involved in Sailsbury is ... 'lets assume for a moment they were, would you be on the list of those who would know?'

2029 2018-03-18 10:37:54 Absolutely. Completely agree.
But it's possible that people don't spend much time selecting stocks because it's not within their circle of competence.
Different people are suited for different activities.
2030 2018-03-18 10:37:25 Yeah actually he did. If you look at the economic chart, the stock market even had a spike just a week after he won because of consumer confidence and more people were buying more stocks. You @DNC supporters are pretty predictable, if it is a problem you blame Bush too so.

2049 2018-03-18 10:07:30 Hi Sasja-the logic behind this analysis is flawed and misleading. Eating less meat will cut emissions but selling fossil fuel stocks in a pension only shifts ownership. Carbon emissions are not changed at all!

2052 2018-03-18 09:59:56 John - for anyone who has studied any AIM stocks having a seller overhang is not that unusual. However I'll agree with you that the timing of this obscured the buy out of Yellow Dragon (increased Vametco stake by 125%) and post November #Vanadium price rise (100% up since then.)

I never attacked him, simply said it was a bum deal and lazy on managements behalf. A polite email to management isn’t going to motivate any shareholders, is it ?
2061 2018-03-18 09:48:51 Nothing from #marr to push @BorisJohnson on definitive statements about evidence, about #PortonDown stocks, about communications with Russia.

2073 2018-03-18 09:37:08 If chemical and biological weapons are so awful, and we demand other countries destroy their stocks, then why is Porton Down still operational? Does the UK still possess chemical weapons? Is that a question for Quora? #marr
2074 2018-03-18 09:36:35 It doesn't seem implausible to me though that you would develop a weapon like this so that it could be stored long term in an inert form, and that those stocks would be guarded very closely. And they'd be exactly the sort of thing that might disappear when a government collapses

2081 2018-03-18 09:30:03 It is better than inflation adjusted price of a US dollar . That is the whole point of gold. It's not about making money. It is about preserving purchasing power.

2082 2018-03-18 09:29:55 How would a purely media channel, as RT claims to be, come out with something so definitive as that. No 'doubtful' etc.
Actually manufactured in Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan where stocks were destroyed under OPCW supervision in the 90's. So in one respect this is true. 
But?
2083 2018-03-18 09:28:59 After taking heavy losses namely $SGH $DSH here are my red flags/after thoughts that I'd like to share.If I was pure TA it would of saved me earlier.

2086 2018-03-18 09:24:25 Shami Chakrabarti arguing that Putin might not be fessing up to losing control of Novichok stocks because he is 'embarrassed'. Hmm
2087 2018-03-18 09:24:21 'It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons- among them, pension funds- to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase the risk.'

2090 2018-03-18 09:21:08 Marr: It is not clear that it was directed by the Kremlin?
Chakrabarti: Absolutely. It was either a lack of control or on the basis of new evidence- that Corbyn has not has access to
Marr: But they said it was the state
Chakrabarti: The state is responsible for its stocks #marr

2093 2018-03-18 09:18:59 The news article conveniently ignores my bearish call just before the budget for a big crack.  Markets clearly headed lower. Opportunity to get into quality stocks will present itself.
2094 2018-03-18 09:16:04 Yes they are and its starts with age requirements like 21and over, bump stocks , register all rifles, and give them an inch they will take a mile. U and your c!ass mates did not learn that throughout history , history repeats itself.
2095 2018-03-18 09:13:08 Other flows ALWAYS go the other way. Capital can't move to stocks in buying action because someone is always selling the said stocks.

2117 2018-03-18 08:22:47 Ok, essentially I said the same thing without the details. The kind of money it takes to buy one legally makes it hard to buy one and the cutoff dates. The law for bump stocks was very similar and didn't seem to be very well crafted. You could own & possess one but not use it.

2141 2018-03-18 07:43:15 When we complain that people have changed, we mean that our stocks have gone down and there is no hope of their revival. Nevertheless, there are buyers for penny stocks too.  :) :)
2142 2018-03-18 07:40:12 Too much hoarding by a selfish few who seem to think we still live in the 1930s and snow will cut them off for weeks (in Sheffield). Happily the other local shops all had stocks. Until today I suspect :-)

2165 2018-03-18 06:58:54 I don't know; I read something that questioned how much a single action could influence stocks, since the time between event and response in this case is so short it's unlikely could've responded so quickly.
2166 2018-03-18 06:56:15 I think this is where the key difference in opinion lies.

You believe a fund manager's job is to provide best returns.

I believe the fund manager's job is to select the best stocks and out money in them.

2197 2018-03-18 06:08:32 I mean, sort of. Buy cards with money, and then later sell them and get the money back. Probably closer to buying stocks, except there is no dividend.

2212 2018-03-18 05:37:48 (2) Trump isn't "banning" bump stocks to actually prevent another Las Vegas shooting, which we all know it can't, he's doing it for political reasons. The darn things are useless for anything except novelty value but of course the Left will never bother to learn why...

2217 2018-03-18 05:33:22 Uhh u can do that on stocks too? And no having a say in something like a merger or a stock split is not the same as “voting” with ur investment .. itd actually strip us of MORE rights if all securities were tokenized

2221 2018-03-18 05:28:28 I believe he started a hedge fund in 2011-2012 and blew it up with massive long positions in the OCN / Bill Erbey stocks that went down 75%+. Not trying to throw stones, but I agree w you, doesn’t seem like a genius or Michael Burry type guy.
2222 2018-03-18 05:26:31 Curious.  In those Education classes to obtain hunting licenses, do they use AR-15's or bump stocks as the Las Vegas shooter used? I truly must be missing something but I don't understand why one would have to use an assault rifle to hunt?

2235 2018-03-18 05:06:02 Do you think that things will change in India if the government started to tax people on what they already have (real estate/ stocks /bonds/ net worth) rather than than taxing them on what they earn(salary) ?

2240 2018-03-18 05:01:33 We can’t buy stocks but as consumers we can affect the prices by not purchasing products. Don’t use Facebook, Instagram, snapchat, vacation at home. Don’t buy new phones, holiday gifts and holiday paraphernalia etc etc
2241 2018-03-18 04:56:41 Why do you equate people that need financial assistance as “gaining the system”? Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to get a job that affords them a retirement plan, let alone stocks.

2256 2018-03-18 04:36:49 Bump stocks are a waste of ammo and you obviously know nothing about guns. The FL age limit will get overturned and you’ll go scream at the sky for the next seven years.

2262 2018-03-18 04:31:07 Well, the gist is that it is a stock game of sorts with a spatial element that controls the payout of the stocks. You invest in different taco truck companies and then manipulate the board to alter the values of those stocks.

2281 2018-03-18 04:10:42 I am extremely curious what the official stock count will be for Smash 5.

64 = 5 stocks

4 = 2 stocks

I know that they won't let it drop below 2, but depending on the speed of the gameplay, it might go up..?
2282 2018-03-18 04:09:18 Do you mostly short stocks?
2283 2018-03-18 04:08:57 Crazy thing is, no bump stocks were used in Vegas or Florida.... But I am still OK with banning them...

2288 2018-03-18 04:07:16 Bump stocks are set to be regulated soon. Nothing else makes AR-15s any more a danger than every other firearm on the market.
2289 2018-03-18 04:03:51 There is a friend of mine that was talking about investing in what were basically pump and dumps. He did not know the difference in Gaap and Non-Gaap fairytales. Nor did he understand what a P/E ratio or cash flow was. I swear people research buying a car more than stocks.
2290 2018-03-18 04:02:21 Trump is about to pass at least some limited gun laws. Which is more than O ever did... I am a 2A supporter. But I am fine with banning bump stocks and raising assault rifle age limit to 21...
2291 2018-03-18 03:58:48 Exactly, and it doesn’t seem like a wise investment, people always say that baseball cards are a long term investment, but when you figure for inflation, you are better off with blue chip stocks, for a long term investment

2300 2018-03-18 03:43:02 First of all we are not taking your guns away. We do need to get rid of the AR-15, make bump stocks illegal. There needs to be more laws to prevent this. We have the most lax gun laws in the world and the only country wit school shootings.
2301 2018-03-18 03:42:12 Broker - buys and sells stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other assets for people who are under the delusion that the broker is doing something other than guesswork.
2302 2018-03-18 03:41:53 People spend days doing R&D before buying a mobile worth few thousands

2305 2018-03-18 03:38:03 Completely different, stocks can actually be valued based on earnings and cash flow. Can we say the same about crypto? There is no reasonable valuation tool and that's a big part of the problem.

2334 2018-03-18 02:59:03 The data is sufficient, but your understanding of the problem isn’t. In your Ex.1, Stock A has 90% weightage and B has 10%. In Ex.2, Stock A has 10% weightage and B has 90%. Read Samir’s question again. Both the stocks have equal weights, i.e 50%.

2337 2018-03-18 02:57:18 Old writers used "property" to mean possessions w/ a legal title rather than wealth: land, stocks. E.g. communists who opposed property weren't talking about toothbrushes & apples. Smith probably was talking about privilege/dispossession rather than amount of wealth in general.
2338 2018-03-18 02:57:07 No argument John. But lots of people invested in franked div stocks like cba for the extra yield. They think it’s a conservative revenue investment.there is much to dislike about our retirement policy if it’s going to be wound back it’s better to do a job of it.
2339 2018-03-18 02:56:27 So, you’re cool with the status quo and see no need to raise the age limit or ban bump stocks or AR-15s (and similar guns)? Any action you’d like to see happen to at least attempt to reduce the number of mass shootings? Do you think mental health is the only factor?
2340 2018-03-18 02:52:29 Is this weight by preference? Or is it a holding/exposure tool while you find single stock ideas? By that I mean, is it an active decision to hold ETFs as opposed to stocks, or step in the process?

Parted
As materialistic tossings to the musician,

Pre-emptive as the slimmer specification
Of intolerant mayhems where the stocks has blinded--

A poem should be awake
As the mango of boundss.
2344 2018-03-18 02:49:25 So I sold $120.60 worth of stocks recently. I did this by selling 1 MSFT and 1 WWE stock. I'm planning to use that money to buy stocks from 3 known  companies I just read about. I'm waiting on the funds, I might go in my pocket to buy DelTaco stocks tho #omts
2345 2018-03-18 02:49:16 matagal tagal pa HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA konti palang stocks namin dito
2346 2018-03-18 02:48:12 Dear @realDonaldTrump, please go on the road, we all need a little 'pick me up', Democrats are truly crazy right now and bringing us down, Jobs, economy, stocks and bringing businesses back to the US  are all great.  We need some cheering for our souls.
2347 2018-03-18 02:48:04 This is the end, it's going to zero, like my Altavista stocks!!! 
2348 2018-03-18 02:46:36 the seeds of future crises are sown by banks.The confidence born of a prolonged period of low interest rates and subdued inflation has led investors to boost the price of risky assets such as stocks, speculative-grade debt, and real estate.liars loans by banks.
2349 2018-03-18 02:43:02 Absolutely...Kael loved it!  Hope you’re doing well!!

2354 2018-03-18 02:38:43 Davíd has officially invested in a bunch of stocks and bonds and it's so sexy #grown

2356 2018-03-18 02:33:02 Investing in random unresearched stocks is like jumping right in the middle of the ocean with no protective gear.
2357 2018-03-18 02:32:04 HAHAHA SONY DECLINES TO COMMENT 
omgosh this guy tho.... i wanna know where he puts his stocks lol
2358 2018-03-18 02:30:22 It’s a good way to think about it though. It’s a win win situation in your mind. Stocks go up your making money, down can buy. If they do go up find a diff one to buy. Other opportunities out there
2359 2018-03-18 02:28:57 How many stocks do you pick from each group for further chart analysis? Is it like 10 groups, 10 stocks so 100 stocks?
2360 2018-03-18 02:28:31 Sameena will advocate for banning assault weapons and bump stocks, implementing background checks, prohibiting gun sales to those convicted of domestic violence, and creating a national gun registry.
2361 2018-03-18 02:27:31 If we start looking at every item like this then no company will make profits nad your investment in stocks will turn red. ROI in stocks is byproduct of consumers’ spending patten.
2362 2018-03-18 02:26:56 Longer waiting periods, no semi-automatic weapons, or bump stocks, EXTENSIVE background and mental health checks and exams. Just basic stuff that will protect everyone.
2363 2018-03-18 02:25:45 @cheaperthandirt why don’t you ship AR stocks to NJ?  The stocks are legal and so are AR’s?
2364 2018-03-18 02:24:22 Maybe members of Congress need to divest of their stocks or put them in a blind trust while serving. The temptation for greed is too great they can't be trusted so enforce honesty. Comforting that you have to enforce integrity
2365 2018-03-18 02:24:13 Really need to stop buying shoes and buy some more stocks :/
2366 2018-03-18 02:23:31 Ok SEC Chief, do your job. Oh, it's Trump pick Jay Clayton who said at his confirmation "I aim  to improve or ease rules to increase the ability of companies to go public and for more people to get access to those stocks." Ryan's not worried.
2367 2018-03-18 02:21:49 I hope Infinite gets smart and buys Woollim stocks or something. Or has a plan to have Sungkyu become CEO

2368 2018-03-18 02:20:02 Lastly I could potentially be down 30$ from stocks I bought yeah it’s looking slow right now only up from here hopefully
2369 2018-03-18 02:19:53 I got stocks in Porsche and Ford pending , I hope the transaction go through...
2370 2018-03-18 02:19:18 Yep, I know. I do it with stocks all the time.
2371 2018-03-18 02:18:25 @jack aren't you to bail out on your stocks? Then now is the time...move on-- as the song goes" take the money & run !! You can hide in Haiti, they only want the children!!!

2373 2018-03-18 02:14:18 fuck stocks , im thinking johnson
2374 2018-03-18 02:08:22 They need to put all their stock in index/sector funds instead of specific stocks.  They keep gaming the market with their access to info and making legislation.
2375 2018-03-18 02:08:06 If you’re having relationship issues just get money. Money is isn’t everything but it’s a lot of things. Things that can turn that frown upside down  #bag #sayless #invest #stocks
2376 2018-03-18 02:07:51 Only on paper. Not in reality. And stocks will bounce back anyway pretty soon as investors don’t care much about Rihanna‘s private life.
2377 2018-03-18 02:07:29 Been thinking. Had time to think on my future too. I think I need to start investing more into stocks 
2378 2018-03-18 02:06:30 pano ako nakapasa sa 1st sem e hanggang ngayon di ko alam ang revenue, stocks, bonds, wtf

2380 2018-03-18 02:05:20 I found him hanging out in the stocks so I suppose not
2381 2018-03-18 02:04:10 Note to self: invest in pop corn stocks. Maybe Orville Redenbacher is public.
2382 2018-03-18 02:01:24 Talking with my Uber driver about stocks I’m not a rich bitch yet but I feel like now I can be!!
2383 2018-03-18 02:01:08 Taking to long I will continue catch up when u can 5. When I get in office I won't have time to play any golf, I'll be to busy working for you the American people 6. Inauguration Crowd size. 7. I'll ban bump-stocks. 8. I am the least racist person..

2386 2018-03-18 01:56:26 At first I read the name as “Oregontinder” and thought to myself that’s quite the handle....A quick double take made me see clearly and have a good laugh. Thanks for passing on the stocks!
2387 2018-03-18 01:54:56 Having actively traded stocks, all sectors, for +20 years, herd mentality doesn't impress me.  If I had $100 for every hot stock/sector that was pumped, then dropped like a cheap watch, to the dismay of the retail crowd, I'd be richer. Lead the charge, and you won't step in shit.
2388 2018-03-18 01:54:04 Tons of other good stocks with potential out there!!! Just trade/invest without Twittverse!!!!!!
2389 2018-03-18 01:52:14 Let’s build together. 

Start a business.
Become a trader with penny stocks.
Start a YouTube channel and just express yourself 
Just a thought 
2390 2018-03-18 01:51:49 I know my stocks are plummeting.. they’d better apologize and work w Ri for some anti-dv campaigns instead of making light of it.
2391 2018-03-18 01:49:37 Hey alpha-tard, bump stocks are mostly definitely not protected by 2A. Put down Guns N Ammo and try reading the Constitution.
2392 2018-03-18 01:49:17 1.We start with basic foundations of CANSLIM. 2,Explain WHAT each letter stands for and WHY. 3,Major Index overview & chart analysis. 4, Charts of Leading Groups & LEADING stocks in each group. 5. Chart analysis Q & A. 6. Psychology
2393 2018-03-18 01:49:07 And own AR-15s, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks...
2394 2018-03-18 01:48:35 @cheaperthandirt why don’t you ship stocks to NJ?
2395 2018-03-18 01:48:32 Yea just saw an ad on YouTube with some dude with 500k in cash and said he trades penny stocks lol where I sign up
2396 2018-03-18 01:48:08 Serious, boring answer is no, because she can still only be on a roster once. Second pick gets voided as illegal, and Stocks probably gets fired for being incompetent.
2397 2018-03-18 01:45:05 Stocks will be on hand next week
2398 2018-03-18 01:44:33 I like it! Reminds me of colonial stocks.  the charging of a fee!
2399 2018-03-18 01:43:45 Enjoyed to be most of the time unplugged - bitcoin down stocks up...
2400 2018-03-18 01:43:17 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone missing in action & vote for the swearing-in.
2401 2018-03-18 01:43:03 We believe every child deserves a chance to live. The Trump adminstration has not honored the promise to BAN BUMP STOCKS and raise the age for gun purchase. Are you worried about your financial status if you lose NRA money?
2402 2018-03-18 01:42:52 How does one stay bullish when we appear headed, one way or another, for a constitutional crisis? Really. Feels like the market is whistling past the graveyard. Still, gotta stand by my core LT holds (like $NVDA) and hope for the best — for stocks and the country. 
2403 2018-03-18 01:42:50 I grew up in rural America. Still have family there and most are entrenched in gun-culture. I understand hunting, target shooting, etc. What I don't understand is anyone's need for military type weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines or armor-piercing bullets.
2404 2018-03-18 01:41:22 Est ce que @Skeptic_j t’a parké de notre deal? Je prend 50% des profits sur les stocks que je recommande!!!
2405 2018-03-18 01:39:27 GDP = growth

In order to Grow = more capex + working capital needs

More Capex e wk needs = smaller fcfe and less dividends

Smaller Fcfe and less dividends =  poor stocks returns
2406 2018-03-18 01:38:03 Its easy to get lost in all this but all that glitters is not gold .. the so called Guru’s i followed on twitter when i first joined have falled house of cards and so have their pumped stocks .. but like they say- the only source of knowledge is Experience !!
2407 2018-03-18 01:32:29 Why is it every time I buy Litecoin that shit goes down?  I have no luck with crypto.  Really need to stick with POS penny stocks.  LOL
2408 2018-03-18 01:31:51 $nxttf $n so whos all excited for monday? Namaste Sean the ceo is doing a live stream at 8:30am and market opens at 9:30am with the stock unhalted. Now namaste can fully execute its business plan and strategy. #stocks #cse #acmpr #cannabis #license.

2424 2018-03-18 01:10:40 Looking to start a Fire podcast but centered on penny stocks
2425 2018-03-18 01:09:40 I see people promoting stocks, I have traded and sold my trades and my secrets to you guys. I made you all a lot of money. Steady income if nothing else. I didn't ramp stocks up to make you all loads and I didn't call every trade right. I traded using realistic rules
2426 2018-03-18 01:09:36 What does this have to do with the markets?  Tell me which stocks to buy.
2427 2018-03-18 01:08:32 Pathetic

2432 2018-03-18 00:59:07 It's fine although I still think owning productive assets like stocks is the ticket.
2433 2018-03-18 00:58:26 I’ve made a decent amount in the current lithium stocks on the asx
2434 2018-03-18 00:58:20 The Public Distribution System (Ration Shops) is the only hope for the poor and the middle class. Please ensure adequate stocks of essential food items of good quality. especially Rice and cooking oil. late TN. CM MGR was very careful on this issue.
2435 2018-03-18 00:56:40 The popular social media app, Snapchat, was down by nearly 4% in their stocks Friday. The loss was suffered after Rihanna criticized the platform for featuring an ad that she claimed was offensive to victims of domestic abuse. #2150ce
2436 2018-03-18 00:56:33 You Google it.............and come back and let me know. 18,000,000 is 18,000,000 but how do you know it isn't more, with investments, stocks, bonds etc? Just curious
2437 2018-03-18 00:54:15 $BTC.X thank god my stocks don’t trade on the weekend, I wouldn’t have known when to drink in ‘08
2438 2018-03-18 00:51:48 The real issue here is your assumption that a drawer full of Australian bank stocks and Telstra represents an adequate portfolio to get someone through 20-30 years in retirement. It is dangerously undiversified and based on an unsustainable tax lurk.
2439 2018-03-18 00:50:40 You know, I was 100% committed to no excessive spending until the only store that stocks my size came out with winter boots. Savings? I don’t know her
2440 2018-03-18 00:48:20 @RickyP6 charts are a beautiful thing -- but, like stocks - history is no guarantee of future performance!!!!! lol........we can revisit in 10 years!

2444 2018-03-18 00:41:34 Buy FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, amazon, Netflix, google)
2445 2018-03-18 00:41:26 Any gold bug from the 80s/90s would have been exceedingly wealthy if they had simply owned stocks. Instead they have a useless pet rock!
2446 2018-03-18 00:41:23 450 euros une GTX1060 ... y'a un an pour se prix là on pouvait espérer une 1070 .... alala, gredins de mineurs de crypto-monnaies qui lessivent les stocks de CG !

2448 2018-03-18 00:40:28 It's looking more and more like a pitchfork march on the capital followed by an open air trial and several members in the stocks
2449 2018-03-18 00:39:54 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2450 2018-03-18 00:39:14 No AR-15s, no gun sale loop holes, no bump stocks, no conceal carry reciprocity, comprehensive background checks, 21 or older...unless I’m missing something, responsible gun owners should agree with these steps.
2451 2018-03-18 00:36:38 Hence Corbyn's curious and repeated use of the passive voice/third person whereby,he spreads the notion of "condemnation" to implicate literally everyone else on the planet,whilst managing to deflect blame from the only party which makes,stocks and uses this Nerve Agent.
Bizarre.
2452 2018-03-18 00:36:13 How is having stricter background checks, banning bump stocks and assault rifles to the public, punishing everyone? Do you really need an AR-15, I mean really need one?

2454 2018-03-18 00:31:12 Welp. It's now 8:30. Tracked back basis on 20 year old stocks. Spoke to folks on the 1035 fail. Just got a kind text from a team member letting me know that Tennessee lost too. I should just go home.
2455 2018-03-18 00:28:31 Nobody asking you to lay down arms. Just keep guns out of hands of mentally ill- uniform background checks- three days waiting period- and ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Give cops even playing field.
2456 2018-03-18 00:28:10 wait, so the national blood service that's been sold off by the govt needs stocks for overseas patients? get to fuck
2457 2018-03-18 00:27:57 Also in Texas, a felon can buy an AR-15 undetected at any gun show, assault weapons are as easy to buy as a BB gun, bump stocks are legal and 26 Texans were gunned down by a guy with and AR-15 and @JohnCornyn and @tedcruz continue to do the bidding of the @NRA
2458 2018-03-18 00:27:28 It’s every Kid-from-Queens’ fancy to turn America into a banana republic (lol), but Trump can’t quite figure it out.

In return for Russian help, he’s making it easier for their oligarchs to buy up US assets at ‘fire sale’ prices. Stocks, infrastructure, properties.
2459 2018-03-18 00:26:30 investment strategy: pick the best stocks

2461 2018-03-18 00:23:02 Makes you question if bump stocks are even an accessory in common use. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Can't turn in what you don't own.

2464 2018-03-18 00:22:08 i probably should stick to clean style headers. I'm not that good at manipulation and using stocks n stuff
2465 2018-03-18 00:19:07 I have a question, how do you determine which stocks will have the most affect on the market (even on a given day) or are leading performers? For example $NVDA (NQ/TECH) $BA (Dow/Industrials) $NFLX $AMZN $BIDU. I’m trying to learn to play strength. Not sure where to look.
2466 2018-03-18 00:18:29 J'ai testé oui mais il y a bien (trop) longtemps. De mémoire il est axé sur des petits commerces car il n'y a pas de gestion des stocks,du multi boutique, etc.
Par contre ai pas de client sur opencart.
2467 2018-03-18 00:17:04 Deadass, I don’t ever hype myself, but the stocks gone up. If all you’re coming at me with is a fun situation I’m good, I have enough fun in my life already
2468 2018-03-18 00:15:04 That's an awesome concept but unfortunately, customizing the homepage is not possible at the moment. The list of recently viewed stocks/cryptocurrencies is the part that is unique to you.
2469 2018-03-18 00:14:29 Rats! I can't help you at the moment. A couple years ago you could find the game but clearly stocks are gone. //  I will look around.
2470 2018-03-18 00:13:08 So there were no stocks in Uzbekistan? You seem to have a great deal of faith in Theresa May, Some refer to her as the 'Maybot'. As with the rest of her miserable cabinet, default setting from boot-up is to lie, lie, lie.
2471 2018-03-18 00:11:16 Jet packs are not real. Bump stocks are real. (Also: “their”)

2474 2018-03-18 00:07:00 Battlefront 2. Sold very poorly, EA stocks went down, mass international debate on gambling in loot boxes.

Those 3 games are not failures. They sold very well and somehow sold millions of copies to people. Financial success for Activision and Ubisoft.

2476 2018-03-18 00:05:51 It also doesn't mean we can't have plans and ideas ready to go. Why do we have to wait for policy to start our end? We don't even have attrition stocks anymore!
2477 2018-03-18 00:03:51 Hmmm.  I'm an avid reader & never came upon this 2012 article about this greed monger's sale of stocks based on insider info. in 2008.  Why was this publicized so little/so late /did I miss it?  Thanks for sharing it, it leaves me sickened but unsurprised.  Vote Democratic!

His position on guns is that of the constitution and the American people.  He's for strict background checks and removing bump stocks n/infringe.

2650 2018-03-16 21:39:53 Trump Administration Moves To Ban Bump Stocks

2651 2018-03-16 21:39:13 How do you know who's only receiving UBI and who is earning money on top of it? Do you know right now who is earning dividends from stocks and interest from bank accounts?

2669 2018-03-16 21:27:18 Doesn’t matter. I love and watch your shows all the time. But on bump stocks, I disagree. A semi-auto is intended to fire as is. When altered with a device to make it fire quickly, that’s not good. And full auto rifles fire at different rates.
2670 2018-03-16 21:27:02 How would you expand background checks? I'll give you illegal private sales, even though it won't help in people dying. And I don't care about bump stocks being illegal bit just so you know I can make a bump stock with my belt...

2673 2018-03-16 21:21:06 @NRA NRA gave us: GCA '68, background checks, NFA '86 and now their ready to compromise on banning bump stocks, more severe background checks and more. Thanks a whole @#$%&%$ lot you compromising bastards.
2674 2018-03-16 21:20:41 Let me fill in 1 tiny gap in the cavernous vacuum of knowledge you possess. NRA has been around over 140 yrs, for most of which there were no school shootings. NRA has trained millions in safe/responsible gun ownership. They have backed background checks, restricting bump stocks.
2675 2018-03-16 21:19:40 @WPXIJoe sitting in for legendary @DavidWPXI I guess this why today Stocks market bounced back 
2676 2018-03-16 21:19:15 2/2 This is why there is concern. If you ban bump stocks, you are saying that a certain rate of fire that a SA is capable of is not acceptable. Who decides what rate of fire is acceptable? This could be used for further restriction in the future.
2677 2018-03-16 21:19:04 Keep an eye on Snapchat stocks over the next few weeks/month 
2678 2018-03-16 21:18:24 Fair comment @DrNickPaul. We do have Indonesian partners on the project who have expressed concern about the effects of climate change on stocks and, ultimately, livelihoods. Worth investigating what a global research team can do to help.

2687 2018-03-16 21:08:11 Why do gun owners think that gun control targets "all responsible gun owners"? In my view, gun control starts with banning bump stocks, limiting access to AR-15's (proven unnecessary to own), and raising the age to buy weapons. /1

2717 2018-03-16 20:57:59 Maybe, but we don't get massive returns because of a little more escapement. We get massive returns because of unique ocean conditions that lower mortality of stocks we are interested in.

The ocean is the key. The problem is we do an extremely poor job of studying salmon at sea.

2724 2018-03-16 20:54:24 Maybe you should devote a segment to comparing stocks to scotches? Aberlour A’bunadh-speculative. 

Or bourbons, or tequilas??
2725 2018-03-16 20:53:26 Before there were guns there were swords...Taking away bump stocks is just a move to try to pacify the people who think “giving violent people jobs will make them nice people”
2726 2018-03-16 20:52:14 @SEC_News Celebrities are tanking stocks like GUESS & SNAPCHAT. They post complaints. The stock tanks. This is a scam to profit on shorting the stocks by the managers of celebs.

2728 2018-03-16 20:50:30 Market Wrapup- stocks traded mixed amid political turmoil closing slightly higher. GOOS stock sold earning 4.8% while DXD and GDI stocks remain open and WELL closing higher.
2729 2018-03-16 20:50:14 Stocks don’t stop. All that’s gonna happen is they lose some value for a few weeks, then gain it and some next month
2730 2018-03-16 20:50:05 Bump stocks were originally made to help handicapped shooters.
2731 2018-03-16 20:49:56 Love how the classically defined “high volatility” small cap biotech stocks chosen by our group not only have provided solid returns but have then defied any market corrections and held the increases in s/p to provide new support levels. Which means the underlying truly is solid
2732 2018-03-16 20:49:21 Trump is doing a great job! My stocks are through the roof! My taxes have been cut, he’s done more for America than any president in history! I am a middle class single woman! He rocks!

2738 2018-03-16 20:42:35 I think a bunch of funds had this scenario in their sights.  And February made it possible.  IMO. 

Like when Bear Stearns and  Lehman were teetering and people started backing away from trading with them and shorting their stocks.

2749 2018-03-16 20:35:00 This shit was invented not in Russia, but in Uzbekistan. In the 2000s under the CONTROL and US funding, production was closed, and the remaining stocks of chemical weapons destroyed. It was not accepted in our army, never!
2750 2018-03-16 20:34:22 I disciplined my child 15 mins ago. I'm a gun owner. I believe we have alot of problems in our society that need to be fixed. I strongly believe in the 2A. I do not think the 2A needs to be extended to bump stocks, high cap mags or gun shows where they don't even ID me.
2751 2018-03-16 20:33:54 Si, il faut bien faire l'inventaire des stocks de bouffe.
2752 2018-03-16 20:33:34 My average is .05 you wingnut. I said that to you multiple times. God, you're thick. Keep cheerleading and screaming at people to "buy! buy! buy!" while telling them how rich they are going to be. I'm sure the SEC loves that.
2753 2018-03-16 20:33:31 World stocks edge higher: US & Europe +.2%. Markets drifting while awaiting catalyst to set short-term direction. Daily headlines will move market until 1Q earnings clear. Likely to be very positive so market should move higher barring trade war or Trump collapse.
2754 2018-03-16 20:33:07 Will you also please introduce a bill to ban assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines so that children don't have to die at school, people at concerts and church, etc.? Children are family, too.
2755 2018-03-16 20:32:54 I did a lot of research on this app a while ago. It’s a clever idea- they lend client’s money overnight and in other places to make up for the ‘no fee’ structure. 
BUUUT the “trade stocks without fees” line that people love talking about is rather misleading.
2756 2018-03-16 20:32:44 This is my favorite long term factor, irrelevant for one year returns.  Almost all tech fall short, but stocks relentlessly up
2757 2018-03-16 20:32:23 I need these celebrities to start talking about movie pass so my stocks can finally pay dividends

2766 2018-03-16 20:23:23 by 10 minutes to 4,  300 million shares had traded in Dow stocks. by 4, at the close, some 641 million had traded. a lot of big mutual funds are waiting for the last price. The stock market is like waiting for the NBA playoffs, for things to matter.
2767 2018-03-16 20:23:14 We agree on increasing laws. I do believe that these types of guns, bump stocks, and high capacity magazine don’t have a place in the hand of civilians. I know that “assault weapons” or “semi-automatic weapons”, only account for 3% of gun deaths, but even one life is worth it
2768 2018-03-16 20:22:44 This country was a mess before Republicans came back to office, unemployment at its lowest,  we dont bow to other countrys, stocks have been at the highest, of course every body is quick to call everyone a racist , i never called Obama a racist.

2772 2018-03-16 20:19:48 I know you like to think liberals are all emotion and no logic, but you evidently haven't noticed the passion with which gun the #nra defends gun "rights" beyond any logic. E.G. good guys know bump stocks are counter productive to any responsible gun use, yet they're still legal.
2773 2018-03-16 20:17:14 I would buy stocks in LVMHF just for Fenty and how easily celebrities sway buying power....but its way too rich for pockets.
2774 2018-03-16 20:16:29 que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien

Stocks give up most of early gains to close up slightly. Dow +72, +0.3% to 24,946
S&P +0.2%, Nasdaq flat.

Red ink for the week but still (mostly) up YTD, with Nasdaq well in the lead:

Dow -1.5% wk, +0.9% YTD

Nasdaq -1.0, +8.4
Russell 2000 -0.7, +3.3

2779 2018-03-16 20:13:28 I wasn't around when it cleared that amount last time. But after watching them and seeing their potential, I think the talk is real this time. They are become a hold stock. Especially with them making expansion moves since December.  $mscp 
hate to be left out on this one.

2781 2018-03-16 20:11:31 I keep learning all these absurd things about my own homeland, like the fact that sporting goods stores sell semi-autos and bump stocks and it's totally legal to beat students with blunt objects.
2782 2018-03-16 20:11:26 Bday next week.  Feel free to buy me stocks
2783 2018-03-16 20:10:17 I felt nervous about the direction of the stock market  lately, so cashed out all my stocks just before the close of trading today.  I thought it best to reduce risk for now, and monitor until conditions are more favourable. Watch stocks go up Monday now that I'm flat!

2787 2018-03-16 20:08:51 (looks up from real life)

No, bump stocks and silencers need to be BANNED.

And you do know that ammo is already equally regulated? Let me know how much success you have getting "dum dum" bullets legally.

Oh, and I don't block #RussianTrolls

I mute them. 
2788 2018-03-16 20:08:35 Very disappointing for longs! I was watching the action on L2 all day and luckily i did not buy the news! my last exit was @ 0.0027!
2789 2018-03-16 20:06:52 Did I ever imply that I didn’t know that? No... That’s why full autos should be legal... And banning bump stocks is ridiculous. The reason why we like semi autos is because they’re more effective. So we can stop tyranny and people from harming us

2804 2018-03-16 20:00:54 For traders:

Some of the best traders in the business stick to only a handful of stocks, currencies, etc.  

I know several that trade only one!

They become experts at just those and trade nothing else.

2810 2018-03-16 20:00:00 The best way to do that is put guns in the hands of law abiding citizens. Bump stocks are very inaccurate and worthless to me, but it’s about the left going after my right to self preservation. We give them an inch they take a mile.

2823 2018-03-16 19:49:19 Broke: bump stocks don't actually do anything but make bump firing more comfortable

2824 2018-03-16 19:49:18 Bump stocks are only there to circumvent the Automatic Weapon ban ?
2825 2018-03-16 19:49:18 So I just got off Toy Story Mania for the 3rd time I’m wondering if they make bump stocks for those yet?

2836 2018-03-16 19:43:54 .@NRA So now you’re on board with GVROs (you already hurried to DC to cave on “bump stocks” after LV). Are you so stupid that you don’t realize the potential for abuse of GVROs? Are you on board with circumventing due process, which should occur BEFORE property is confiscated?

2934 2018-03-16 18:53:53 Hmmm. That is a good point. So i guess trade nimbly for near-term USD rally / equity risk off, and then pile into Gold long? It also seems like if USD rallies, the momentum/tech stocks may sell off hard - for whatever reason the FANG rise accelerated w weaker dollar lately.

2937 2018-03-16 18:53:03 So we can find common ground if we don't just tweet platitudes.

1. We need more studies on what causes gun violence and what increases/decreases the number of victims.
2. We don't need to take away all guns, but make some changes to existing laws, such as prohibiting bump stocks
2938 2018-03-16 18:51:08 Set the stocks to two
2939 2018-03-16 18:50:52 Were not trying to ban guns, were trying to pass common-sense reforms like background checks, banning bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. If you can’t hit your target with 10 shots you have no reason to be firing a gun in the first place.

2948 2018-03-16 18:45:37 There are lots of silly stories emerging. 
Not so silly is the fact that this agent was made in two other places - Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and that, so concerned were those countries about inept security that in 1999 they called in the USA to decommission plant & destroy stocks.

2952 2018-03-16 18:43:50 So if it's not minorities that make our country have a higher gun homicide rate then what is it well I think we could look at the fact that there are more guns in the US than people. Some of said guns can be almost fully automatic (Bump Stocks) and even semi automatic

2954 2018-03-16 18:41:56 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
2955 2018-03-16 18:41:08 We dont have to learn anything bc the #FederalReserve and their cronies will buy stocks at all costs-sad truth.

2962 2018-03-16 18:38:02 Banning bump stocks is a concern because it does not effect the actual function of a semi-automatic. By banning bump stocks, it would be implied that there is a standard rate of fire for SAs. You would basically be banning the maximum capability of a semi-automatic.
2963 2018-03-16 18:37:47 Bad week next week for U.S. stocks. An interest rate hike will likely be announced on Wednesday.

2973 2018-03-16 18:30:14 Yeah I was lucky to buy some more. Im keeping my mind focused on the longer window of return. Next qtrs numbers are projecting well, a plan on the Canadian cannabis model is coming soon and the valuations of AOI were low to begin with and high in cannabis stocks.

2978 2018-03-16 18:28:47 Can you check the stocks ? Or is it done ?
2979 2018-03-16 18:28:32 I am an avid Pro Second Amendment enthusiast, I believe every American has a right to own any type of firearm they want. Bump stocks have no place in hunting or casual shooting events. So I am for a bump stock ban but the rest needs to be left alone.
Go President Trump!
2980 2018-03-16 18:28:12 As stocks were decimated in 2000, people borrowed against their homes. When mortgages collapsed.  The Big Swindle became The Big Short.
2981 2018-03-16 18:28:03 Weapons like the AR-15 are not needed for "home defense" (which is *vastly* over emphasized, the Wild West days are long over) or for sport. But I don't know how to properly single these out from other weapons. Bump stocks definitely need to be banned ASAP. 2/
2982 2018-03-16 18:27:52 At time of Enron, an economist told me, "no one should ever buy their company's stock. You should short your company's stock." Of course, ordinary people shouldn't short stocks, but point is, you've already invested your labor, and will be hurt if company fails. Spread the risk.
2983 2018-03-16 18:27:39 So.....I've never really cared much for the Jenner/Kardashian tribe, but their social media influence is....astounding.

Kylie merely tweeted that she doesn't really use snapchat anymore after the update and that sent sc's parent company stocks down by 1.3 billion (6% lesser)

2989 2018-03-16 18:25:58 In the last 16 years these have been the weapon of choice for mass shooters.  They have no real value other than to kill or be a toy for wanna be’s.

2997 2018-03-16 18:22:20 Bump stocks have been outlawed in some areas now. It helps a rifle cycle fast, thus making it fire quicker. Really makes no difference because you lose accuracy with rapid fire. You could do more damage shooting slow.

3000 2018-03-16 18:20:17 as far as I know, the main reason why etf on futures and inverse etf have been created is due to many regulations prohibiting/restricting retail funds (such as EU regulation on Ucits funds) to deal in futures, derivatives and short selling stocks

3015 2018-03-16 18:10:14 Here's problem on tech selloff.  There is nowhere to really rotate to due to shit valuation in even value stocks.  Energy and REIT's could see $$ come into.
3016 2018-03-16 18:09:25 Our new burritos won't be shipping to any retailers until mid summer of this year. We'll have more info on vendors then. As for other products, @veganessentials stocks many of our products and @target  ships our Cheddar Style Cheezy Mac

3018 2018-03-16 18:07:50 I can easily see ADT share price going lower than $7/share before we see any type of recovery in share price , that is my opinion , I have been wrong before , but Oil stocks and energy have been slammed past few years , that is the sector im looking at right now,buy low sell high
3019 2018-03-16 18:07:50 Too much money coming into tech stocks past month chasing returns.  Bitcoin redux.
3020 2018-03-16 18:06:46 Then why are my stocks so low?
3021 2018-03-16 18:06:38 It’s been the trend. If they headline, stocks and net worth always go up even if the public is bashing it. They’ve monetized our reactions. Remember that

3031 2018-03-16 18:03:23 Got it. That makes sense now. Yeah didn’t they ban bump stocks at one point and Trump like reversed it? Idk. But I agree they’re taking any route for gun safety except the most obvious ones.

3047 2018-03-16 17:56:30 I can see that. But I could also see a bunch of people signing up to Robinhood for no-feee crypto, then maybe stumbling into stocks later. I’m super curious about the real numbers!
3048 2018-03-16 17:55:17 Stocks "headed for a bad year"?? lol.  Why does it look like that to you? People, analysts, have been calling that for 18 months.... yes, nothing goes up forever....but it seems the main reason people give is because it's been going up for so long.
3049 2018-03-16 17:55:13 Decided to start exploring and investing in the stock market. It’s exciting to learn something new every day! Today I learned that some stocks pay dividends.

3093 2018-03-16 17:34:46 One of my stocks is up and recovering from the past month. I just know it’s a matter of time before it goes down again. This is stressful
3094 2018-03-16 17:34:13 Don't know where you live but in BC the railways run down both banks of the Fraser River. Any derailment would be disastrous to the river and it's salmon stocks.

That stuff was only made in the 90s, post Soviet times.  Where? Russia.

3106 2018-03-16 17:28:26 To be clear, I have no idea who this is in  reference to. But the point still stands: a lot of people "delete everything and leave in a huff" because they're put in the public stocks with no key. It's much easier to start a mob than it is to stop one.

3109 2018-03-16 17:27:48 exactly.  I "traded" in the mid-late '90's.  I quit after '99... it was a wild ride... I lost $ 

I bought a handful of stocks in 2008 after the crash, held, and sold them in 2017 when trump took office.... made good $.

waiting for the next crash to go again.

patience is key.

3122 2018-03-16 17:18:17 1/ What about these scenarios:

Drug dealers in middle of transaction.
They hear police coming.
They know they get death sentence if they get caught.
Having nothing to lose but 100% chance of dying, they pull out semi-automatic weapons with bump stocks, and ammo with bullet proof

3132 2018-03-16 17:14:26 If Mirzayanov states that stocks would have degraded in 30 years, he had better have some good chemical evidence for that statement. Because it does not fit the pattern as we see it in the open literature.

3136 2018-03-16 17:10:51 I'd also add that the shot with the pink flowers is obviously way overexposed. Ektar doesn't deal with that as well as other color stocks. And if there are reds in frame it goes nuclear. Rapidly changing light killed me here.

3146 2018-03-16 17:06:42 I feel that. But def accept it. Bitcoin will be fine. People like to compare it to .com bubble stocks. Bitcoin isn’t another company, it’s the whole industry. If you were to compare it to anything, from that era, it would have to be Microsoft.

3149 2018-03-16 17:05:30 I have seen on some stocks that get added to these indexes, there is indeed a push up and with a tight float and many of us planning on holding for much higher profits, could be outstanding lift off if we are fortunate.

3159 2018-03-16 16:59:23 I am not in favor of outright "bans." They tend not to work (e.g., liquor, drug laws). I am instead in favor of "well-regulating" the hell out of 'em.

Class III license for bump stocks.

I'd also be in favor of a Class III license for any weapon with a muzzle energy of 1200+j.

3164 2018-03-16 16:55:45 Big players do not want to take a small number of small market orders. It makes your quantity no longer a convenient multiple (i.e. 1000 shares in most stocks). What big players want is a single big fill from another big player. That's why they hang a little away from market.

3176 2018-03-16 16:50:40 There are few gems in many sectors. Will share a complete list with details after i prepare excel sheet. These stocks are way under valued and performing outstandingly. It's just that they are out of sight of smart money. When they enter in these stocks story would be different.
3177 2018-03-16 16:50:33 Automatic weapons are very difficult to get due to regulations. The Las Vegas shooter could have afforded them, but he used bump stocks instead because it was easier. That's the point of gun laws - make it very difficult to get the guns that are used in these crimes.

3214 2018-03-16 16:35:24 Jumping in, hi: I find a lot of tea has a subtle and interesting flavor, including PG Tips (our office stocks it). I am not a subtle and interesting kinda guy, in tea among other things, so I generally can't stand mainstream teas. Do you still work near Teaism?
3215 2018-03-16 16:35:13 hahahaha. amazing noh? tapos alala mo yung last month, inokray ni Kylie Jenner ang snapchat tapos bumaba rin ang stocks
3216 2018-03-16 16:34:59 Stocks are relentless....
3217 2018-03-16 16:33:46 Their stocks dropped 6% for Kylie and now 4% for Rihanna.  they’re laying off 120 engineers because of the losses they taken this year alone.
3218 2018-03-16 16:32:47 Bonjour Hugo. Le McFlurry au Cadbury Creme Egg est disponible dans les restaurants McDonald’s participants jusqu'au 2 avril 2018 (ou jusqu'à épuisement des stocks). Nous sommes désolés de vous avoir déçu.
3219 2018-03-16 16:32:36 That's a prime example that investing in stocks is a hoax. If you're a share holder and see a chunk of your investment disappear because of someone's opinion that has nothing to do with finances, would you trust investing in wall street which is a house of cards?
3220 2018-03-16 16:32:13 Di rin ako abot mam dun sa top 100 kahit anung level bigo haha kaso O version lang ung ibibigay nila...cguro dahil ayun ang marami stocks sila? Haha

3223 2018-03-16 16:29:28 There's some people who know what they're talking about in wanting Jose out.

Then there's plastic African experts like you who know fuck all and talk shit, making the fans who do know their stuff laughing stocks.

There's nothing wrong with Lukaku, he's doing the best he can.

3228 2018-03-16 16:28:05 Current: Partly cloudy with scattered tweets; 61% chance Donald Trump wrote this himself.

Tweet Forecast: Stocks would be a total meltdown with their unmatched spirit, know how bad ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats in the Middle East would be ever!
3229 2018-03-16 16:27:24 Talk is talk, I'm looking for results and #POTUS Trump has delivered in droves. Bump stocks don't matter, they're a waste ammo.

3231 2018-03-16 16:26:51 I'm not a true believer in stocks. I'm a true believer in stops until proven otherwise.
3232 2018-03-16 16:26:45 Today was the day of FTSE rebalancing, hence funds tracking FTSE index had to buy this stocks.
3233 2018-03-16 16:25:42 The market is stablizing. Bullish, bearish, it doesn’t matter. When it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies or stocks, leave emotions at the door and invest smart. #bitcoinprice #bitcoin #Etherium #Crypto

3237 2018-03-16 16:24:37 Here’s a thought....why don’t you add a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks to your overhead pet ban.   Shame on you, you nra lackey.  You’ve got blood on your hands you hypocrite
3238 2018-03-16 16:24:05 Was feeling myself way too fucking hard at the last weekly. The only thing I had right was momentum. Both the sets I lost there were moments where I took entire stocks and a half without getting touched once.
3239 2018-03-16 16:23:52 $50,000 to my parents. 
$200 on an Elgato capture device
$1500 on a new gaming computer. (Current one will be used as the streaming/recording)
$600 on a vive.

The rest, $17,700, goes into my savings.

3246 2018-03-16 16:19:47 IMO the stocks are flat because we already had a huge runup. Need time for the underlying assets to catch up, even if we are in a bubble. Can't go straight up for ever.
3247 2018-03-16 16:19:02 But the known names of finance in the media are saying higher rates are not good for stocks- they are short ? most likely
3248 2018-03-16 16:18:51 Expecting Huge Increase in volume next week with Many Spring Breaks coming to an end, The time to load up stocks you like is NOW imo
3249 2018-03-16 16:18:49 This comes AFTER Trump said he would ban these bump stocks. Strange that you didn't do a similar story then. Just more bias on your part.
3250 2018-03-16 16:18:30 I honestly think there were that many stocks
3251 2018-03-16 16:17:50 How much time do you have? I’d put it in a high interest current account, unless I could wait >5y for returns, where it would go in a unit trust wrapped in a stocks & shares isa.

3266 2018-03-16 16:10:59 Had a similar tweet question about fundamentals not long ago. I don't disagree on the speculation/fundamentals, but people with the mindset of Warren Buffett do notice fundamentals and buy at the lows. Buffett is wrong about Bitcoin, but his tactic in stocks is worthy of praise.

3290 2018-03-16 16:02:03 Partly I agree with U here regarding inflation , labour force and interests rates but why for the last 4 days stocks market is continuously going down ?? Why right after firing of Rex ? Investors invest when they see a trade friendly govt and operators , pretty sure 1/2
3291 2018-03-16 16:01:31 Very whippy action is not conducive to good investing. Just cuz markets open for business doesn't mean you have to do "business." #stocks
3292 2018-03-16 16:00:46 With the interest of fairness and equality, its the shops policy not to hold stocks for valued customers despite numerous requests and direct messages all the time from our twitter base.

3301 2018-03-16 15:55:41 Margin accounts are built for investors looking to borrow funds as part of their trading strategy. Interest only applies once the trade settles, which is two business days after your trade is executed for stocks and one day for options; this gives you time to exchange funds.

3303 2018-03-16 15:55:03 Majority of the US stocks and a fair amount of the UK stocks on listed on your platform aren't actually able to be traded. You have to ask and then a few weeks / months later they might (or not, often) be enabled. Still a good choice for an ISA you reckon?
3304 2018-03-16 15:54:43 Mutual Funds are loaded with Gold. I don't see it as a better investment than Stocks right now. Maybe later in the year when its lower it'll be a buy. Plus its almost at its 1 year high. Silver Crypto & Stocks seem like better investments now.

3323 2018-03-16 15:47:45 Current laws need to be made stronger. No gun sale should take place without a background check. Magazine size should be limited.

3344 2018-03-16 15:38:22 During the wall-less Bush or Reagan administration did we have “open borders”?

Bump stocks are popular. Is Trump trying to “take our guns”?
3345 2018-03-16 15:38:19 GOPers, answer me a simple question. Why do we need bump stocks, high capacity magazines and silencers as accessories for our guns?
3346 2018-03-16 15:37:09 Bump stocks need to be banned.  Anyone altering any firearm to be become an illegal  machine gun is a criminal.

3350 2018-03-16 15:36:27 S&P 500 capped off longest losing streak of yr yesterday, down 4 straight. Rising import prices and Mueller investigation’s request for info from the Trump Organization on Russia weighed on results. Breadth was negative. 8 sectors dropped. Three rose. Stocks up slightly today.

3359 2018-03-16 15:34:31 @DekmarTrades took a $490 loss on $DXR but learned what mistakes I did. Noticed a lot of green candles with long upper shadows but decided to hold. Didn’t buy on my resistance level and most important didn’t take profits when I had them. Learning a lot understanding stocks.
3360 2018-03-16 15:33:38 Sorry for the inconvenience Paul, hopefully stocks will be replenished very soon.

3364 2018-03-16 15:31:19 Making bump stocks illegal on shot glasses? Now THAT'S going too far.
3365 2018-03-16 15:30:45 Teach me how to invest in stocks please.
3366 2018-03-16 15:29:59 I frankly blame all the *ssholes on TV with their "tax cuts means stocks will go to the moon" attitude. It is these *ssholes that got people into trouble. If they tell you the market won't go down, you should go 3x long the market. Why not?
3367 2018-03-16 15:28:29 I wish you would have acted this quickly in banning bump stocks after Vegas or Parkland massacre!  #Priorities
3368 2018-03-16 15:28:28 Stocks may remain pinned here for a while.
3369 2018-03-16 15:28:19 Stocks are all trading positively this morning.  MBS is currently down 5bps, just underneath the 25 DMA.  Yields are up to 2.84% now.
3370 2018-03-16 15:27:45 As an entity, but to claim that the instructions came directly from Putin is quite a leap. The former USSR developed the agent, but who has access now? Do they even have tracking details of the stocks? The silence is incriminating but not proof positive.
3371 2018-03-16 15:27:21 Bump stocks are going to be banned. Even Trump said so. You’re getting really tired right now. Boring.
3372 2018-03-16 15:26:42 Yes, yes, yes!  Good point. I say vote all the NRA patsies out of office and that will take care of part of the problem. Then, we can outlaw the weapons and bump stocks. Trump and his cronies are cowards, always siding with the NRAs money.
3373 2018-03-16 15:26:33 @AJNewsGrid The only known way to improve the execution of this dirty deed would be to get access to a nerve agent not known to exist in Russia.  Not impossible to do but would take a lot of time to get access to stocks of such stuff in another country
3374 2018-03-16 15:26:13 Sir...Is there a way to find if promoters have increased or decreased stake on selective number of stocks in single page?
3375 2018-03-16 15:25:53 ya probably like 1000 shares total. I put in a big buy amount just to see if i wind up with any. im still targeting that $3 warrant and maybe the $7 one now depending on the premium. i am hoping for a little run into the IPO for my other stocks. $TGOD
3376 2018-03-16 15:25:46 Without gun control there would be no bump stocks.
3377 2018-03-16 15:25:45 U.S. Stocks Rise
3378 2018-03-16 15:25:23 We can probably agree to let them take our 'rapid fire bump stocks'.. Lol..

3386 2018-03-16 15:22:55 It’s dramatically different than stocks! But I love risk and volatility. I’m a holder and observer for now.

3391 2018-03-16 15:19:41 or is this the so called witching stuff? 
really weird behavior. VXN & VIX down more than 5% each, end of week this alone should prompt a big re balancing that should crash the thing further so then how could stocks stay where they are

3396 2018-03-16 15:16:28 "Bitter Clingers" cling to the idiotic delusion that the 2nd Amendment endows them with the unbridled right to bear whatever they want.

3422 2018-03-16 15:05:05 Investing in stocks is a test of patience.

Investing in cryptocurrency is a test of vision.

3426 2018-03-16 15:03:12 #Stocks,#Indexes To be explicit: we are not short.  It was not that sort of top signal.
3427 2018-03-16 15:03:07 US impossible trinity = Rising FFR, Rising USD, Rising stocks.  US can have 2 of the 3.  If FFR & USD are rising, stocks cannot sustainably.  If USD & stocks are rising, FFR cannot.  If FFR isn't rising, isn't that a problem for USD bull case?

3439 2018-03-16 14:58:36 What I gotta do to get you involved in trading stocks 
3440 2018-03-16 14:58:04 2)   Russia has stocks of this nerve agent  and has lost control of it or someone else has knowledge of how to develop it, and .....
3441 2018-03-16 14:57:49 The talk of Bear Stearns demise ten years ago reminds of my favorite time to buy stocks—-when Wall Street fears for its life. 1980 was such a time.
3442 2018-03-16 14:57:30 1) Russian has stocks of this nerve agent and has not lost control of it, and .....
1a)    That the Russian state did this under the direction of Putin  and  used this particular nerve agent to guarantee that everyone knew  it  was  them.
3443 2018-03-16 14:56:44 Oh and Churches,movie theaters,nightclubs,malls,

3444 2018-03-16 14:56:09 Yep but once they became a publicly traded company they had to change. They couldn’t afford the bad publicity otherwise stocks would plummet. If Vince had it his way he would go back to attitude era in a heartbeat. Just too many snowflakes now a days
3445 2018-03-16 14:55:22 And to buy stocks in AOL (and to move them into Google when that starts up).
3446 2018-03-16 14:55:22 Back in the Internet stock craze, I would get a call from a friend who told me what stocks the Boys from Brooklyn were buying. Worked like a charm.
3447 2018-03-16 14:55:01 If the USD rises & US FFR's rise, stocks cannot sustainably rise due to the US impossible trinity,  If you analyze the importance of stocks to US tax receipts, you learn that if stocks don't rise (let alone fall) on strong USD, tax receipts WILL likely quickly fall.
3448 2018-03-16 14:54:35 One steering wheel falls off a Ford—millions of cars instantly recalled

3451 2018-03-16 14:54:14 I hope you're right, but it won't stop them trying. They may just ban bump stocks and leave it at that.
3452 2018-03-16 14:53:16 Maryland House just passed 3 gun safety bills--a ban on bump stocks and similar devices, a red flag law to temporarily remove guns from those who pose a danger to self or others, and a requirement for domestic abusers to turn in their guns
3453 2018-03-16 14:52:38 Before you diversify your investments into another mutual fund, don't forget to check the stocks in its portfolio.

What's the point in investing in another fund if it invests your money in the same set of stocks which is already present in your current fund?

3457 2018-03-16 14:51:13 As you pt out, tax receipts falling is clearly a possibility.  But is not certain.  Stocks can continue to rise (and tax receipts with them).  Regarding the $, you are correct we've been waiting & it hasn't happened.  Reminds of those waiting for Volatility to pick up 2017.

3474 2018-03-16 14:43:25 It's clear that you "want it all, want it now", probably what made you turn to penny stocks to begin with.  Sorry to break it to you, this is a REAL BUSINESS, WITH REAL GROWTH.  Anyone knows business takes time and to be blunt, the speed of execution here is INSANE.

3476 2018-03-16 14:42:22 If you buy anything mobile or manufactured, you can;t refinance it. If the listing has the word mobile, manufactured, or modular, I will not bother looking at it. I was able to refinance my house and take cash out to buy the stocks.

3504 2018-03-16 14:32:37 for one thing, that SOB had several rifles. The two with bump stocks may not have been used. Last I heard. 500 RPM can't be sustained even with a bump stock. Magazines hold 30 rounds. and it takes 3 to 4 seconds to change one. that's at least 20 changes. Barrel would burn out
3505 2018-03-16 14:32:31 I agree! It’s very frustrating for many to understand why others think they need an assault type weapon and bump stocks.
3506 2018-03-16 14:31:58 @TheSeaAngler I think it's really sad the state of our fishing stocks in the UK waters. An example of this is the fact you are constantly posting about Norway and big fish.

3515 2018-03-16 14:28:00 "Bump stocks don't make a rifle fully automatic..."  But I suppose a spent firing pin and burnt out barrel is of no consequence if you are shooting up a concert full of people once.  I'd say 500+ shot was a pretty successful day for that bump stock, pin and barrel.

3557 2018-03-16 14:11:09 can you say....bump stocks don't make a rifle fully automatic. They do increase the rounds per minute marginally. But not full auto. They also wear out the firing pin quickly. And burn out barrels faster.

3596 2018-03-16 13:55:20 Stocks start mixed and trying to end a bad week. Considering people resign from the government more than McDonalds. Causes stocks to pause. Andrew Left shorted Netflix but that seems like a risky trade. Jessica Jones is so good. $nflx is so good. Up today.

3618 2018-03-16 13:47:07 I toughed it out as did my wife for 30 years now. I still kinda think she would enjoy putting me in the stocks now and then to remind me who is really in charge.
3619 2018-03-16 13:46:44 That trader was not in sub penny stocks. no one shorts these stinkers. And short interest is and will always be insignificant.
3620 2018-03-16 13:46:25 Not Russia. Uzbekistan. Both were in the USSR at the time. The US verification team did not get to the plant until 1999. That left 7 years for the mafia to buy stocks.
3621 2018-03-16 13:46:03 Unfortunately all stocks are sold out at the moment bud, if nobody drops out and there are still people that are interested I may release more in coming months, but for now we're gonna keep the limit to 200. I'd suggest checking at the start of April, may be space then
3622 2018-03-16 13:45:53 Rallies struggle in grains despite sharply lower production estimates out of Argentina. Many of the markets consolidating, looking for direction w/ weaker bias; Fed and budget bill next week's big focus. Could be pivotal time for dollar, commodities & stocks.

3627 2018-03-16 13:44:27 Yes but you don’t get semi automatic knives or screwdrivers with bump stocks. It’s a questioning degree. Otherwise allow everyone to have a tank.
3628 2018-03-16 13:43:50 So VIX is at 15 after 2 attempts at 2800 in the last 2 weeks got rejected?!? Well that makes a tone of sense. I guess if people don't want to pay 2800 for stocks, they will surely pay 3000.

3680 2018-03-16 13:22:37 Been a few days @NYSComptroller since I’ve pointed out that you must divest NY State from fossil fuel stocks. Today would be a good day for you to announce you are. #divestny
3681 2018-03-16 13:22:00 The Clinton era "Assault Weapon Ban" of 1994 did exactly nothing! It banned guns by name (they were renamed), it banned pistol grips (thumb hole stocks were used), it banned flash hiders (they were removed).
Leftists fear the way certain guns look, not how they function.
3682 2018-03-16 13:21:28 There are bans on bump stocks. And high capacity magazines. In some states anyways. But criminals don’t follow the law and have them anyways.
3683 2018-03-16 13:21:25 They actually haven't banned bump stocks yet, so any rifle that's semi can be converted into automatic rifle. Banning 1 gun won't do anything especially if your not banning the device that makes that weapon shoot rapid fire..
3684 2018-03-16 13:21:17 Stocks received a boost from the +9.4 point increase in the U.S. Mar Empire manufacturing index to a 5-month high of 22.5, stronger than expectations of +1.9 to 15.0.
3685 2018-03-16 13:21:12 i remember 2-3 years ago i was meditating on what i wanted to do to contribute/create more income sources and both stocks and computer science came to mind. if i followed those thoughts, i would probably be way further financially bc of crypto. best time is always now though.
3686 2018-03-16 13:21:01 Stocks were also undercut by trade concerns after comments from White House economic adviser Kudlow who said China has earned a "tough response" for not playing by the rules of trade
3687 2018-03-16 13:20:42 I read it as "socks" instead of "stocks" my dumb brain was confused for a good 3 minutes or so HAHA but yay you 2k that's great

3738 2018-03-16 12:54:34 Yes, Syria destroyed it's CW stocks under OPCW supervision after it was accused of using them. The same wasn't true about the rebels who have also used them, BTW. Nobody knows who has what in Syria. Doesn't that make "did the weapon come from Syria" a valid question?

3838 2018-03-16 11:58:05 qui peut se targuer d'avoir fait une teuf dans un wagon bar avc 30pers, d'avoir littéralement vidé les stocks du bar (bon dépensé 45e mais nsm), d'être sorti en rampant au bon arret (!), d'avoir décuvé et d'avoir enchainé 3h après sur une mine du feu de dieu ?

3842 2018-03-16 11:55:45 They acknowledged that there will be a “next one” indicating another mass murder. How do they know? Because it happens regularly, & because the @NRA & @GOP are blocking effective gun laws from happening. Ban & surrender ARs, bump stocks, large ammo capacity. End the @NRA
3843 2018-03-16 11:55:08 Bought it back in 1998 @ $6 and sold it at 120. @ $300 I thought it was too expensive to buy. Now it’s trading around $1500. Makes you wonder if some stocks are better than real estate.

What does a balanced portfolio look like for growth or income, and how should we change it as we age - e.g. adjusting down the amount of stocks/shares in your portfolio as you age - so at 40 having 40% shares. True?
Plus all the other great questions.

3886 2018-03-16 11:15:45 Snag for the Russians is that they always denied having any such thing. Cannot admit to it now. But the bloke who led the development defected to USA and told the world all about them. USSR stocks would have degraded by now. Means RUS is still manufacturing fresh stock.
3887 2018-03-16 11:15:08 They were designed to be made from readily available chemical stocks in the sort of laboratory a senior school would possess, that's the whole point of them !
3888 2018-03-16 11:15:02 Back in the boom of the late 1990s, when technology stocks seemed to be  doubling in value every day, the  notion that  you could lose  almost  all your money seemed absurd. But, by 2002, many of the dot-com  and  telecom  stocks had  lost 95%  of their value or more. #Bitcoin
3889 2018-03-16 11:14:10 This is fraudulent company #KidsMedicalSystems UC as buyer at 49 and seller at 49.2. Scoundrels are distributing at peak level to retailers. Save yourself if you can... believe me else you`ll regret afterwards. Never buy stocks on the basis of bulk sms(marketing)
3890 2018-03-16 11:13:48 Novichok agents were made only in one place: Shikhany in Russia. What May said is correct: either Russians used them, or lost control of the stocks. Either is unforgiveable. Since they have not offered a response the assumption is that they used them. Could have said 'Not us'.
3891 2018-03-16 11:12:07 Maybe because it refuses to sign the chemical weapons convention and join the OPCW, or to declare it's chemical weapons stocks? Unlike 96% of the worlds's nations? (But like North Korea).

3896 2018-03-16 11:10:33 Certainly, at least the ones who invested in those ETFs indices: iShares MSCI World Value etc

3904 2018-03-16 11:02:16 The evidence: to make it statistically significant we need more historical returns that we have at this moment. 

There are accountancy issues, for example energy stocks in 2014 - the book values remained high, so they looked cheap, and consequently, value indices picked them up!

3986 2018-03-16 10:02:02 Gotta love the total disconnect(Not your Mother,all our mothers) in describing Crypto's as Stocks. They hear but they don't have very much intrest in learning. Hopefully time will cure that. I'm trying to do my bit by educating my boys about money/crypto.

3992 2018-03-16 10:00:37 It's likely they'll get initial stocks around the same time, but it will depend on number of pre-orders vs the stock they receive and where you are on the pre-order list. Ummmm, it depends on what's wrong, sometimes turning off and on does help, so it's possible!

4007 2018-03-16 09:46:13 I'm sure tomorrow or anytime in future they'll buy other companies' stocks just to save themselves from the monopoly

4012 2018-03-16 09:43:54 You cant hold stocks in your hands. They can disappear in the blink of an eye. But land? Land will never disappear. Its a tangible investment that you can literally walk on. Theres depreciation. It wont wear out. Nothing can be stolen, and nothing can be broken.

4014 2018-03-16 09:43:03 OVERWATCH ENTERPRISES stocks slump
4015 2018-03-16 09:39:16 It is a bit like saying that stocks (tokens) will flippen USD (ETH) or Gold (Bitcoin). There is a structural reason why stocks will not flippen the base currency.
4016 2018-03-16 09:39:12 Before popping a couple of nerve calming pills, and listening to soothing music by Mozart, I checked my trading tool. Surprisingly, many cash stocks are holding steady.

No worries, I'll follow this routine maybe tomorrow.

Also bump stocks and large magazines. Not just to prevent mass shootings everywhere also to reduce suicide.

4021 2018-03-16 09:34:32 I am not saying STOCKS are involved. I am saying that the value of CRYPTO changes every day. So, its like a stock, with no CONTROL by any exchange or govt. Simply, put, its one mans dream to own a currency, and a million peoples nightmare !!
4022 2018-03-16 09:32:10 There are no stocks involved, it’s mining of currency. I repeat do some research.

4032 2018-03-16 09:29:01 There was an EU wide scrappage  scheme because there were too many boats and not enough fish. Overfishing was a problem everywhere, that's also how we ended up getting our arse kicked by Iceland in the Cod Wars. The CFP did a terrific job of restoring fish stocks.

4037 2018-03-16 09:22:25 I don't want to compare crypto to world poverty and say that crypto is better.

All I am saying is this
1) Crypto is not a CURRENCY. Its an INSTRUMENT OF MONEY
2) Its risk is same as Stocks, in fact MORE
3) Its model is same as PayTM.

Dont call it CURRENCY, call it CRYPTO STOCK.

4040 2018-03-16 09:19:44 Stock trading is regulated..
 1) Govts tell stocks are risky instruments
 2) All ads of IPO's carry a MANDATORY risk statement
 3) If a company stock plunges or rises sharply, SEBI launches a investigation.
 4) If stock plunges/rises more than 16%, trading is halted.

4046 2018-03-16 09:15:58 If enough of them get into stocks maybe the stock market can finally top out for a few years.
4047 2018-03-16 09:15:54 PayTM is owned by a company where as you store your money in a personal wallet. Losing money depends upon the risk taking capacity of a person. By your logic millions got washed out in stocks recently so should we ban trading in stocks?
4048 2018-03-16 09:15:44 We love Xiaomi a lot. Not enough stocks breaks our hearts. Request you to please don’t launch a product in India if you don't have stock.

4053 2018-03-16 09:13:19 Tell that to the fisherman in the UK that were paid off to stop fishing altogether, boats sold or just scrapped. And the CFP was brought about because the EU nations had already destroyed the med with overfishing as well as to protect our fish stocks.
4054 2018-03-16 09:13:16 #MutualFundsSahiHai When you buy a mutual fund, you are able to diversify without the numerous commission charges. Imagine if you had to buy each of the 10-20 stocks needed for diversification.

4062 2018-03-16 09:10:55 If crypto currency value fluctuates, and I could lose my money in converting it into crypto and back, then crypto is not PayTM either. Its like buying stocks of a company. And the stock value determines my wealth.  Its worser than we think it is..
4063 2018-03-16 09:10:48 Morning all.. Wall St was boosted by a strong rally in United Health, a large Dow component and this calmed nerves somewhat with the Dow closing up 0.47% but the S&P closed marginally lower so a mixed session with stocks still looking rather vulnerable.

4065 2018-03-16 09:09:01 Russia never made any Novichok. It was only developed as a theory and never put into pruduction.
Additionally, Russia's last stocks of chemical weapons were destroyed last year. All 40,000 tonnes of it.
4066 2018-03-16 09:04:14 @BorisJohnson Israel has extensive stocks  of chemical weapons but has always refused  to declare any of them to the OPCW. Israel is not a state party to the  Chemical Weapons Convention nor a member of the OPCW
4067 2018-03-16 09:02:21 rihanna is so powerful.... she dropped snap stocks by millions in a matter of hours for speaking  out against DV imagine if she spoke that way about the government
4068 2018-03-16 09:02:12 Not saying there should be no responsibility but comparing crypto and stocks... well, in crypto you can invest really small amounts and sometimes you may get rekt x20 or earn x20, or one and the other pretty quickly. Makes it less comfy, in that way.

4079 2018-03-16 08:53:43 Timely corrections at markets are healthy as it reminds us we were connected to most Riskest asset classes among others.

Investing sensibly mostly rewarding you in coming future. Have faith on your stocks selection and never use leverages.

Hope it helps.

4087 2018-03-16 08:48:01 Yes, we do not have 1,000 years data,  but I think they are intuitive as well.

Value in the end means buying cheap stocks, they may be cheap for a reason - mainly due to headwind, but wind changes direction! Small cap, because they are small present opportunitiea to grow!

4094 2018-03-16 08:45:09 Is this your first currency you've invested in? It went down to a dollar this winter, and then passed it's all time high at 6.5$. Cryptocurrency is volatile, it always has been. If you can't handle the volatility trade stocks.

4112 2018-03-16 08:30:21 Let’s not confuse the issues.

It is one thing to invest ONLY in small cap and value stocks, and it is a different mater to have a small tilt to small cap and value stocks.

Value and small cap factors are clearly proven, but they are risky and could underperform for 10-15 years.

4133 2018-03-16 08:08:19 I mean it’s so much cheaper to buy fruits and veggies if you’re already shopping at a place that stocks them. Also, no one said veganism was about losing fat/muscle. There are a crazy number of plant based athletes and body builders

4135 2018-03-16 08:07:12 Last night I dreamt that me and a friend had a very productive meeting with Vladimir Putin. He was funny and charming, but slightly aloof. He told us he really fancied Theresa May. She was in the corner in some stocks and people were throwing sausages at her.
4136 2018-03-16 08:06:55 I’m not surprised that Snapchat stocks went down 5% after @rihanna said to throw that app away. What they pulled is insulting and disgusting
4137 2018-03-16 08:05:13 “a Russian nerve agent”? By which you mean, a nerve agent originally developed in the SU decades ago, all stocks of which were subsequently verified destroyed; the chemist now living in the US, having published the formula which can be made in any lab. Evidence? I think not!
4138 2018-03-16 08:04:28 I too think it is nuts but comparing movement of 10 stocks now to 100 in 1999 is not really a true comparison. Simple statistics can prove that. Reason 1-2 stocks always move way more than indexes.
4139 2018-03-16 08:03:54 Your gifs are very funny. I also believe Bitfinex has not audits cause they are illegal. But I've traded with ECNs for decades and I've seen all these patterns in nasdaq stocks. It's not spoofing cause anyone can hit those big orders at any time.
4140 2018-03-16 08:03:43 A Russian developed nerve agent was almost certainly used. The Brits have even identified it as Novichok. However, I suspect the Russian leadership has lost control of the stocks. A faction inside the Kremlin, without authorisation may have attempted these murders. We dont know
4141 2018-03-16 08:03:17 What are the parameters you use for finding momentum stocks? How can we find one ourselves? Please enlighten..
4142 2018-03-16 08:03:03 The recipe for Novichok was published some 25 years ago by a later defected KGB agent.  The formerSoviet states' weapons stocks were rifled (pardon the pun).  The recipe is available openly and there is no way of tracing it's origin.  Porton Down is the likely source.

4193 2018-03-16 07:22:59 The stats are beyond me I'm afraid, but the main point's a familiar one: 'derisking' USS (e.g. by moving from growth stocks to safer, lower-yield gilts/bonds) actually increases the risk of default, because returns are less likely to cover liabilities.

4222 2018-03-16 07:00:14 I cant see how banks approve a loan at 4.5% but people could, if required, pay 7%. That is an absolutely enormous jump in repayments.

4319 2018-03-16 05:39:41 Also, the first line of the tweet refers to stocks falling. I was referring to the biz side. Of course, domestic violence is bad. But Kylie, Rihanna, etc...leads to massive loss for investors.  Not good for a company...

No one is taking the effing 2A away - we are asking for some basic sensible gun controls - age limit, restrict bump stocks, background checks etc

4328 2018-03-16 05:27:19 Tip for education: Read up on william O’Neill’s studies on 52 week highs and lows.   In a jist, my takeaway years ago was-Stocks that are high go higher and stocks that are low go lower. He proved this to be accurate with 52 week breakouts and breakdowns. Counterintuitive AF.

4336 2018-03-16 05:24:28 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

4452 2018-03-16 03:49:22 Since in trading currencies you’re buying one currency and selling another, you’re simultaneously going long and short. Therefore, unlike trading stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and most other asset classes, currencies, as tradeable instruments, have no structural bias.
4453 2018-03-16 03:48:53 Contribute to your 401K the max % the employer will match & then whatever else you can contribute put into a Roth IRA till you reach it's max. If you have more, buy growth Mid-Cap stocks.
4454 2018-03-16 03:48:34 I see the problem. You started with “ I think”, which means you do not know. Libtards are not interested in just limiting the sale based on mental health or stopping the sale of bump stocks. Be real!  We all know better. Come back to reality.

4463 2018-03-16 03:41:41 The banking stocks should be entered and exited at right times; banking is not possible without exposing to risk but frauds in banks are definitely not to be digested at all. It is something that can't be seen as business risk and should invite strongest punishment.

4472 2018-03-16 03:37:08 Don’t give it too much thought.  Traders make and lose money all the time.  Over reflecting will make you gun shy the next time there’s a great set up.  Stay away from those crazy stocks, tune out twitter or if you’re on stock twits and don’t try to make up that 10k tomorrow.

4476 2018-03-16 03:34:06 Lol the professionals, huh?  Pretty sure I know where we are.  Im sorry that a 300+% gain in a week isn't good enough for you.  Not my fault you bought at 15.8.
4477 2018-03-16 03:32:49 Problem is that the multi-family market has been greatly monetized with investors from every part of the country. A lot of apartment developers weren't looking to become super rich. Now we have bulk investors looking for a quick return on their investment. It's a lot like stocks.

4480 2018-03-16 03:32:04 Anybody with any stocks in @iHeartRadio has probably just about lost their damn minds... and their money
4481 2018-03-16 03:31:43 If you bought stocks at the all time high in 2007-2008 and are still holding, you've made 9% per year and doubled your money. 

But if you sold them anytime between 2009-2012 you lost money. Just think about that next time stocks are at a 6 month low like in FEB 2018.
4482 2018-03-16 03:31:36 What nonsense. That our modern interpretation. Putting people in stocks in the public square did not used to to considered cruel and unusual punishment. Nor did drawing and quartering. It's whatever we say it is.
4483 2018-03-16 03:31:15 Nakakainis hahaha. Ilang beses ko ring tinanong kung may mga out of stocks sa orders ko. Di nag-reply hahaha
4484 2018-03-16 03:30:28 Not much of a gain when one is still underwater is it? And yes, "bro", I do. Enough cheerleading. Leave it to the professionals. Best of luck in this endeavor. (I still hate the 1:100 R/S because of what it will potentially cost me. However if it a F/S is in the cards....

4489 2018-03-16 03:28:11 Probably drugs. Have they checked the ketomine stocks? Ask Harrison to check around the Borchester crack houses to see if she’s been seen “helping out”
4490 2018-03-16 03:27:11 STOCKS TO WATCH Yes Bank sells 1.12 crore shares or 2.17 percent stake in Fortis Healthcare on March 15.
4491 2018-03-16 03:27:02 You guessed wrong. I never sold. Added another 5k last week. Like I said, more ticked at the "rah..rah..rah" "we gonna be millionaires" with nothing written in stone. Hopefully this is over in short order and we all make moolah.
4492 2018-03-16 03:25:44 I would agree, but I think it’s easier to pick up on “good O IQ” just by looking at a/to ratio (though that’s an oversimplification) so team D is even more often forgotten/underrated. Stocks have correlation w/ team D but I would say not as much as a/to w/ O IQ.
4493 2018-03-16 03:25:27 It's a scam like most coins thanks back lost so much money to guy should have thought this s*** through
4494 2018-03-16 03:24:38 United Airlines really fucked up. I advise you all to keep an eye on their stocks and take screenshots. Could be useful later in proving the market can cut out the bad by people not buying from them and refusing to buy their stocks

4498 2018-03-16 03:20:11 The hilarious part is that Hasbro & Mattel stocks dropped on expectations they’ll lose 15-20% of their business this year and thus far both manufacturers refuse to set up online stores that allow customers to order directly from them, cutting middle man out to try and make it up.
4499 2018-03-16 03:16:39 These people are selling your privacy to the highest bid, Manipulating the Stocks by increasing Taxes and Price of goods, giving wall street a huge Tax Relief, cutting disability and Social Security, right under your nose and u dont sniff it?

4550 2018-03-16 02:36:03 You know what they should teach you in high school? Taxes, health care and stocks. I think those courses would make a whole lot of good in the long run.
4551 2018-03-16 02:34:35 But they can't have 3 multicap funds. It is most likely being repositioned as a focused multicap fund. They will reduce 5-6 stocks.

4556 2018-03-16 02:32:28 It’s not all about AR 15’s although frankly there is no room in civilian society for them. Bump stocks, gun show loopholes, magazines 10 or less, standardize background checks, umm idk maybe allow the government to actually study gun violence?
4557 2018-03-16 02:31:01 I think this is really not the right time to tough the sugar stocks.

4558 2018-03-16 02:30:47 gotta recognize the reasons you're losing stocks in bracket, I find myself doing repetitive stuff that the opponent adapts to so I work on mixing up my options more. also the low tier life is a sad one

4563 2018-03-16 02:22:13 Thank you for the, um, clarification. You're a stock broker ("regulated" to be sure) but still a salesman of stocks. No? There's no such [real] thing AS "a fiduciary", fiduciary responsibility, yes, but "a fiduciary"? Please clarify. Or not. Not you're responsibility. Consumer's
4564 2018-03-16 02:21:45 So I should call our financial advisor and pull all of our money out of stocks ? Okay. Maybe we all should do this
4565 2018-03-16 02:21:16 You didn’t say bump stocks are the problem. You said fully automatic assault rifles are. The mass majority of gun owners and the NRA agree that bump stocks should be further regulated.

4567 2018-03-16 02:20:01 .. has technologically superior weapons or try to put control restrictions that do little to affect the criminal market? I believe that we should control gadgets such as drum/disc mags and bump stocks, but said regulations will do little to deter criminals obtaining said items.
4568 2018-03-16 02:19:52 How are we going to pay for this when you just gave over a trillion dollars back to companies so they could buy back their own stocks? We all have to pay taxes. It is how the country runs. It is not always fair. Suck it up, Buttercup.

4675 2018-03-16 01:12:38 I don’t think it should be one or the other. The only right thing is to ban military weapons & do buybacks. All sales with background checks - no private sales. Ban bump stocks. Only these things will save children & also no putting animals where there’s no air!

4689 2018-03-16 00:59:49 Either bitcoin from the beginning or tech stocks in the 1990s
4690 2018-03-16 00:59:28 investors are taking more risk due to their wants for assets. however soon those risk can become too risky if rates keep increasing but stocks fall. the economy needs to grow not fall behind due to investors #SquatBubBull @JoeMa40
4691 2018-03-16 00:58:07 I would’ve been extremely pissed right now if I purchased them Snapchat stocks like I was supposed to.
4692 2018-03-16 00:57:14 #tdameritarde sucks!  #scottrade was so much better. The buyout is a joke.  The platform sucks, TD did nothing to ready themselves for the transfer!  #stocks #investments #invest #trade #buysell #money #investing #stock #broker #onlinebroker #moneymanagement #morons
4693 2018-03-16 00:56:30 Don’t get me wrong I knew the basics i read how to make money in stocks by Bill O’Neal many times early in my career but didn’t know about the other stuff.

God says fast from social media or make a sacrifice & folks have a problem & cry about it, some don’t do it!

4698 2018-03-16 00:52:18 I hope beatrd have lotsa stocks for ls. I've had enough disappointment last night. You guys don't have to add it up. Tq.
4699 2018-03-16 00:52:11 I personally don’t want our rights to own specific categories of guns to be taken away, such as the AR-15. But it is illegal to own fully automatic rifles in the US. And I have no issue with banning an accessory like bump stocks that increase the fire rate. Its inaccurate anyways
4700 2018-03-16 00:52:05 Loop holes as in gun shows, online purchases, etc. The one thing I do think NEEDS to be banned is bump stocks! I am not saying we should take away guns, I just feel we can do things to rest assured they go into the right hands!

4703 2018-03-16 00:46:31 Sugar pays great dividends. Excellent long term stocks.

4706 2018-03-16 00:45:27 Respect,
4707 2018-03-16 00:44:17 I am staying away from speculative stocks
4708 2018-03-16 00:43:38 OMG this me. I just fell over when I read this. I am outstanding at ONE THING. Right now stocks but my soul wants to quit investing. I want to be  on team health but I need more money first. I got denied disability from our government even though it was doctors who filled it out.
4709 2018-03-16 00:42:55 But that's exactly why common sense gun laws make sense. Better mental health screenings. Better trainings. Get rid of bump stocks because why are they necessary? I don't care if someone has a concealed carry for protection. Go for it. Just do it the right way.
4710 2018-03-16 00:40:34 Come on @RawStory , it’s CNBC. Stocks tanked but cocaine sales are up in DC.

4714 2018-03-16 00:38:33 Conservatives aren’t saying a word about deregulations that allow the poisoning of our food, water, air and land. But make assault weapons & bump stocks illegal and they get crazy. Judging by their reactions, conservatives don’t seem stable enough to own any type of gun.
4715 2018-03-16 00:37:08 So he could have killed and injured all those people without AR15s and bump stocks?
4716 2018-03-16 00:36:38 Could it be the Dems own bank stocks? Or were promised bank jobs when they are thrown out of office? What's the connection folks?
4717 2018-03-16 00:35:41 If you read 20 to 30 law review articles about stocks, then you may come to a realization that what you have does not count as a stock, at least not anything that educated people about laws relating to stocks would consider as such.
4718 2018-03-16 00:35:03 Might be a good time to get your money out of stocks.
4719 2018-03-16 00:34:26 Because handing out pills that make half of the people dependent, and cause the other half to shoot up schools is more profitable. Monopolize healthcare, buy some stocks in the Firearms industry and - voila.
4720 2018-03-16 00:33:30 No Military style,multi mag,armament in civilian hands. Testing,licensing,registration,insurance. No armor piering rounds. No bump stocks. Back to the days of my dad's NRA,when they cared about people.

4722 2018-03-16 00:33:00 Them Snapchat stocks is low eh? ..... @Snapchat y’all can make that comeback if you just, you know.. uh..

... go back to the old snap 
4723 2018-03-16 00:32:49 You actually don’t. I know you’re very busy in this new job, but you must not say things before you check the facts. This is not supposed to be entertainment, its running a country where you actions impact Billions of people and there retirement stocks.

4727 2018-03-16 00:32:02 Beginning to think about bonds, stocks and investing in your employer’s provided retirement plan are key to making smart #investments.
4728 2018-03-16 00:31:37 To be accurate: it is easy to make money investing in the stock market long term, because you do not have to "beat the market" to make money in stocks. "Not much worse than the market" is still 6% annual return over inflation on average.
4729 2018-03-16 00:31:27 Given that stocks are reliant on moderate inflation and the economy is on its knees, what viable alternative do they have for alleviating the debt, deficits, pensions, and unfunded liabs problem other that doubling down on reflation strategy which requires a weaker $ imho.

4736 2018-03-16 00:25:23 Because Canadian TSE is commodities heavy, and commodities are under performing. It's a world market and stocks are not fine grained indicators of economic health like wage growth and employment rate. Name the businesses leaving in droves; I can name the ones moving in.
4737 2018-03-16 00:24:12 I was wondering why my Snapchat stocks were down today only to realize Rihanna post caused it. I love it! Now imma sell it soon.
4738 2018-03-16 00:24:08 Do the stocks usually go live right on release time? (Dumb questions but I’m trying to learn from the pro)
4739 2018-03-16 00:23:18 Verbs that end in "ing" are gerunds

Gerunds are those vernd which take on the behavior of a noun noun and are typically present tense.
4740 2018-03-16 00:23:16 With the tax cuts and budget increases, won't all this government borrowing make treasury bonds a more attractive investment than stocks and whatnot?
4741 2018-03-16 00:23:10 A1: Pump & Dump: As more and more investors buy shares, the value of the stock rises sharply. Once the price hits a peak, the scammer sells their shares and the value of the stock plummets. You’re left holding worthless stocks. #Fraudchat #FPM2018  3/3

4745 2018-03-16 00:20:35 Stocks were mixed Thursday after a report that special counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to Russia and other topics.
4746 2018-03-16 00:19:58 If God himself told me that knives kill more ppl than rifles I would tell him he was full of shit. Bump stocks should have been banned after Vegas & not used as a bandaid for the Parkland shooting.  The shootings may not stop but lives will be saved when change comes.
4747 2018-03-16 00:18:54 I secretly appreciate how celebrities can singlehandedly tank certain tech stocks.
4748 2018-03-16 00:17:14 I was trying to point towards how bump stocks make mass easier with a sarcastic slant.  Maybe sarcasm isn't appropriate in the context. It's hard to make all comments mock-proof. Sober times & words are not always taken at face value. So sometimes sarcasm seems more challenging.
