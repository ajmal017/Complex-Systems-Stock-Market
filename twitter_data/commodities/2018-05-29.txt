38 2018-05-29 21:55:08 I think there’s a few bubbles around, but capital will always find a home, so whilst some assets will do poorly, others will benefit. Capital flow. I’m bullish on commodities (tangible assets), together with other assets not associated with government issued debt (bonds).

47 2018-05-29 21:16:39 In commercial (commodities) sales, we might have much more complex visions of loss beyond ‘loss’; eg evaporation...

48 2018-05-29 20:50:43 I don't know much about this Dankwambo. We can no longer buy non-tested commodities again in Nigeria. Most were deceived 3 yrs ago.

49 2018-05-29 20:39:34 They are all a dime a dozen commodities that can be replaced in one second by 50 other guys and the league wouldn't miss a beat.  The league only exists because of the trillions of $ "wagered"/speculated on the games.  The players themselves are irrelevant and disposable

54 2018-05-29 20:23:01 Why is the price of food commodities still high in the market? Why is dollar still 363? Why is petrol still 145? Why is subsidy now higher than it was under PDP? Why is the insecurity in the land higher than it was ? Why is it that PMB achievement are only on papers?

68 2018-05-29 19:29:13 When the yield curve collapses, stocks decline and commodities roll over, it is a potent warning sign of a looming slowdown 6-9 months down the road. Should this continue, it will turn into a recession warning, as well. Not there yet but global risk is rising.
69 2018-05-29 19:28:17 I have...5 people out of 200 or so that are currently up to these types of shenanigans. No problem with people making their money, but turning your friends and family into commodities is kind of a line.

98 2018-05-29 17:41:31 Crude oil, just like most commodities, is a risk asset. And so are emerging markets like India. They all usually tend to move in tandem over longer periods. Moreover impact of inflation needs to be considered too. Also crude denotes global growth n many Nifty sectors benefit 1/2

116 2018-05-29 16:33:38 @AndrewBellBNN On #Commodities, you wondered how the federal gov't's takeover of Kinder Morgan pipeline assets might be managed, but mentioned that they referred, in their press release, to how their holdings of @GM shares... 1/2
117 2018-05-29 16:32:46 I saw a ridiculous fb post last week from a man referring to abortion being replaced with adoption, as its “simple supply and demand”.
Babies are commodities now. 
118 2018-05-29 16:27:43 This is a very misleading statistic when you don’t also include total acres. Those 6 commodities account for 90+% of acres farmed.
119 2018-05-29 16:26:51 R20/hour minimum wage is an insult to our people.  Commodities are so expensive especially in the times where VAT is being increased
120 2018-05-29 16:16:03 el argumento es que en momentos de crisis, el oro funciona como refugio de valor, no es que yo piense así, pero si es un argumento esgrimido por muchos analistas de commodities
121 2018-05-29 16:08:05 Lots of stop runs today. Most commodities and equities should be cleansed for next leg up.
122 2018-05-29 16:04:59 So if you have a son, you won't teach him about consent or considering women as humans and not commodities? That's my point. It HAS to start somewhere.

126 2018-05-29 15:52:48 as someone who comes from a family of immigrants, some undocumented, it hurts deeply to see these families being torn apart. to see that these children have been forced into inhumane situations. to see that no one cares. humans are not commodities. they deserve respect.
127 2018-05-29 15:40:33 exactly!! since when did beauty become physical? like i don’t want you to call me beautiful, i want you to call my mind beautiful. but nooooo, women will be objectified and turned into commodities because that’s what men do, and it makes us all insecure.
128 2018-05-29 15:39:41 Inflation took a spiral turn and prices of commodities went to the roof tops. These continued as the president health situation lingered. The economy contracted and GDP figures hit the negative mark. Recession then landed

131 2018-05-29 15:21:40 Tecnocracia : Ministro em sabatina na CCJ do Senado diz que o petróleo e derivados - gás de cozinha, por exemplo - são  commodities . Ou seja,  o mercado é quem regula e, claro, compra quem pode. Simples assim. Não é visto como setor estratégico para o país e a sociedade.
132 2018-05-29 15:16:22 Burrice, não fala besteiras! Governo não pode intervir artificialmente de forma eleitoreira no preço de commodities... Controlar não é pegar o dinheiro do contribuinte e bancar a conta e arrobar a empresa no caso a #Petrobras né! #Fato
133 2018-05-29 15:13:48 But central bank suppression of gold and silver will not last. The ramp up in inflationary pressures that are still to come. This is why interest rates are surging, along with oil + other commodities, which have ended a brutal bear market and begun a new bull market.
134 2018-05-29 15:13:07 Simply because of Ramadan. Commodities increases! Other countries it reduces only in Nigeria we are that as an opportunity to make more money when people are fasting! Nigerians are 100% hypocrites. We pray the most but couldn't be considerate during Ramadan.

138 2018-05-29 14:57:14 Many Canadians east of the Rockies depend on commodities being marketed for employment & their future. I have travelled through the Rockies often enjoying the natural beauty. The pipeline is a risk to the environment but Canada was built on utilising natural resources safely.
139 2018-05-29 14:56:25 But unfortunately, lots of women aren’t in the position to choose to not sell their bodies. Instead of supporting the industry that commodities these women we should work on getting them out and then maybe rebuilding from scratch. Too many men see women as objects to buy

153 2018-05-29 13:52:59 Actually, I think tokenomics will actually make it easier for us to barter trade commodities. People will need to think about needs and wants by design. Crypto currencies will facilitate “nice to haves” - like useless gadgets from China.
154 2018-05-29 13:50:26 Didn't the Catholic Church in Ireland act like gods, controlling women, treating the kids like commodities to sell and thought they couldn't be stopped ever?

160 2018-05-29 13:26:21 Commodities trade mixed however weighing on price is firmness in US dollar and weakness in equity market. The euro has slumped against the US dollar on political uncertainty in Italy and Spain and ECB’s cautious tone on monetary policy.

162 2018-05-29 13:26:07 My father was totally disabled in a union carbide uranium mill when we were very young in the 50s. We ate commodities supplied by the government cheese, processed meat, rolled oats, sorghum molasses quite different than today's food stamp elitist program for people who could work
163 2018-05-29 13:26:04 Most commodities on domestic exchange trade higher amid weakness in Indian rupee. Rupee depreciated by 0.6% to trade near 67.85 levels against the US dollar. Weaker risk sentiment has pressurized rupee
164 2018-05-29 13:21:59 Yep. That’s capitalism for you. In the US, healthcare is a business industry just like oil & gas or automobile manufacturing. We humans are commodities and the “parts” we need are also.

177 2018-05-29 12:42:28 Lest us not forget that under Obama, gas prices exceeded $4 per gallon in some markets and was over $3 for about 3.5 years.  That said, gas is still one of the cheapest commodities we have.  If it followed inflation, we would be near $10

192 2018-05-29 11:32:23 But to a trader, "Priceless". Cryptocurrencies are already exiting the world of money and commodities and entering the world of financial instruments and derivatives where relative value is the only thing that matters.

194 2018-05-29 11:21:35 They will protest for consumers if the prices of commodities go up and protest for farmers when they go down. Lol win in both cases.
195 2018-05-29 11:21:31 Interestngly, cathedrals were public goods built by artisans (but under the direction of despotic rulers). The bazaar is a place for merchants selling alienated commodities. I don't find the metaphor that useful,but maybe I just don't share ESR's market-centric view of the world.
196 2018-05-29 11:19:48 I think the "cathedral" vs "the bazaar" is about more about forms of collaboration. This is more about control: means of production, commodities, producers, consumers.
197 2018-05-29 11:05:19 I'm sure dutertards are also watching/listening to the news. No comments about the rising prices of commodities? No criticism about the train law? All of these are OK? You still love #Duterte? Build, build, build pa rin? Don't blame the past admin for all these.

A security token represents an ownership stake. As in an asset. As in real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities.

241 2018-05-29 07:10:52 Rupee has faced precipitous fall as compared to dollar and commodities since Bangaru Laxman episode ,so don't be shocked with a staggering amount of bribe.
242 2018-05-29 06:59:01 To minimize the impact of the insurgency on IDPs, Government has established secure IDP Camps and improved mechanism for the distribution of basic aid, foods and essential commodities in collaboration with local and international Organizations- President Buhari #DemocracyDay #PMB
243 2018-05-29 06:19:45 I've stated Cass was one of the FIVE exclusive names I stated when asked which wrestlers from each promotion would you like to fight? She won a second championship recently and she deserves it. She is one of the hottest commodities in the world right now.

You want the next shot?
244 2018-05-29 06:18:47 Amazing charts and tweets @PeteWargent ....... not just our commodities boom directly linked to china. Numbers are staggering
245 2018-05-29 06:15:29 I ended my usage of precious data while listening to this Mumu @NGRPresident when he mentioned " We revamped an ailing Economy". An ailing economy that had prices of commodities lower than yours? I prefer that ailing economy pls......
246 2018-05-29 06:15:00 @SarahHuckabee if you don’t like to be called a liar, quit lying and covering for this douche in office. Grow some pride and maybe help create a world where children aren’t treated like commodities and shooting targets.

1 John 4:20 - you should read it.
247 2018-05-29 06:05:48 Beginning to see your point...what are the known everyday commodities of this team currently? Hosmer, Myers (DL), Hedges (DL)? 1 out of 8 positions? Handling of pitchers & lineups..of course injuries has made it difficult. I can tell you now competing by 2020 ain't happening!

249 2018-05-29 05:58:29 Pipelines don’t base their rates of use on commodities. Companies pay rates based on volumes. If a company can’t make the volumes they leased they still pay. You should learn a little more about our energy industry!! #Pintsforpipelines
250 2018-05-29 05:58:25 I don’t think your government is at fault. The Presidency of the United States is a powerful position with a powerful voice, able to affect the price of stocks and commodities, like oil, with a statement or decision. 
A great day to all on the ‘other side of the pond!’
251 2018-05-29 05:54:01 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp 
Petrol stations should open mini super markets selling basic commodities/ eatables, to facilitate the consumers as one stop shop..
Especially highway petrol pumps(eg. mumbai-pune expressway) can help the travellers and will also improve employement..

253 2018-05-29 05:22:24 I dislike the term “MILF” because the “F” is a deeply selfish term that best fits men who look at women as commodities and objects. Therefore it’s most often used by MYNFs (“Men You’d Never Fuck”). First person variant: MINF. Same pronunciation.

255 2018-05-29 05:03:13 Noong pino-propose ito, mayroon tayong assurance na iyong presyo hindi ganito, iyong presyo ng mga basic commodities hindi ganito iyong pagtaas. Pero iyong inflation natin, ano na, napakataas na ngayon -VP Leni @manilabulletin

257 2018-05-29 04:41:27 You forget where the Justice  system return stolen commodities  back to the thieves.   #"Vrede gupta estina farms"#
258 2018-05-29 04:40:39 Anyone interested coming up with a $BTC consensus forecast like Bberg does for commodities? We could capture the biggest accounts calls for the bottom or the end of the month and pubslih the average (with or without details). Has to be TA based.
Thoughts...
259 2018-05-29 04:39:14 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
260 2018-05-29 04:27:19 Yeah the society is always okay with other woman being displayed as commodities as long as its not someone you know. But you forget a woman you know is a stranger to other men.
261 2018-05-29 04:15:20 So new product for speculators, are prices under control for agri commodities where future trading happens, in major mkts these futures are used more for speculative trades than hedges ....
262 2018-05-29 04:05:11 #Modi is hurting the commoñman by 200+% excise hike on petrol and 400+ % excise hike on diesel.Since both commodities affect even a person earning Rs7000/= pm and excise is regressive tax Govt should look for direct tax option for augmenting revenue shortfall

263 2018-05-29 03:27:45 Different subjects must be thought of as hashtags rather than folders, adverbs rather than nouns. The siloed department exclusively focused on “my majors” is insane, as is the Admissions office pitching subjects like distinct commodities at Target: Everyone choose a (1) flavor.
264 2018-05-29 03:17:31 Yup, but for some people that’s apparently fine now... I wonder what our ancestors would have done if they had to fight in a battle with the PC mindset “no don’t hurt me, you are offending me” honestly pathetic... all the commodities we have made us lazy and over sensitive
265 2018-05-29 03:05:59 It's our place to say and that's why we have consumer protection agencies. Computers and telephones weren't essential commodities when their antitrust cases were decided. I'm wondering where antitrust was ever instituted for tomatoes and rice. Your economics has a hole in it
266 2018-05-29 03:01:49 Note that Japan's % of GDP from agriculture sector is a mere 1%. Their prime resource to draw on is via education,  not land. Adding value, not churning out commodities. 
If #SouthAfrica wants to create jobs, we need to radically transform ideas of "radical transformation"!

268 2018-05-29 02:06:17 Sir, pls start nationwide door to door campaign to defeat bjp in 2019. Raise the following issues; all media houses are purchased by bjp, they are doing work for bjp, bjp hiked rail fare, all medicines, all essential commodities, looted public money
269 2018-05-29 02:06:08 Commodities Check

West Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.2 percent to $67.09 a barrel, heading for a fifth consecutive decline.

Brent crude traded 0.6 percent higher at $75.74 per barrel.

Gold was little changed at $1,300.07 an ounce.
270 2018-05-29 02:04:48 The decreasement of the necessary commodities is the sign of good governance...
271 2018-05-29 01:59:45 Sem dúvida as administrações passadas falharam! No tempo do governo Lula, com os commodities, tinha uma montanha de dinheiro e ele não investiu nem em ferrovias e nem hidrovias! Que isso sirva de lição para as futuras administrações do país!

273 2018-05-29 01:47:36 Denomination of various key international commodities, eg. oil, in USD helps prop up the currency.
274 2018-05-29 01:44:41 What Brengle said is really true, tennis players are actually commodities. Not just for drug tests but also for selling tickets looks like it
275 2018-05-29 01:44:34 I don't know if your argument really holds up though. I agree with you that there is an unreal amount of bullishness that has no true grounding in economics. However, there is not the same artificial scarcity imposed on those commodities.
276 2018-05-29 01:34:18 Auba and Mkhi were known commodities. We’ll see about Mavropanos. We need him to find underrated studs because we aren’t competing with our budget. We are about to sign Sokratis who is terrible.
277 2018-05-29 01:31:28 i love how so many people on vegan twitter shit on individual farmers in the animal ag industry instead of shitting on the industry itself, the corporations that turn animals into commodities at alarming rates, + most importantly the system that allows this to happen (capitalism)

280 2018-05-29 01:12:34 Vets are living w/ disabilities, mental illness, & debilitating, untreated pain. They are dismissed by the government who, instead of honoring them & providing the most basic levels of medical care/pain care, Veterans are treated more like commodities. America needs to do better.
281 2018-05-29 01:07:35 I love targeted ads as well. I have actually found great companies & products that I didn’t even know existed thanks to them! I’d rather see ads for commodities I enjoy than random truck and tool ads that have no relevance to me
282 2018-05-29 01:04:10 @cirogomes espero ver aquela aula marota sobre commodities, produção nacional, exportação de petróleo bruto, importação de refinados, ociosidade proposital da indústria de refino instalada e política de preços equiparando o mercado interno ao externo.
283 2018-05-29 00:57:25 Se apresentou números bons foi devido à massiva compra de commodities feita pelos chineses, foram milhões de toneladas.  Do lado brasileiro já tinha acontyecido o mensalão e outras atrocidades incluindo o aparelhamento crescente do estado estavam em curso. A população sabe disso!
284 2018-05-29 00:56:14 Pedem ditadura pra acabar com um problema criado pela ditadura, que privilegiou contratos com montadoras internacionais, abandonou o sistema ferroviário, gastou milhões em rodovias (péssimas até hoje) e deixou o transporte de commodities dependente de, bem, caminhões

288 2018-05-29 00:49:22 Trump’s manipulating stocks, commodities and currencies. Making important  arrangements, cancelling then changing his mind as he sees fit? We see you Trump, we see you 
289 2018-05-29 00:48:06 What... no mention of the “slave castles” the white European colonial settlers used to rape African women they kidnapped before shipping them over to America to give birth to more commodities by the time they reached the shores of stolen land?
290 2018-05-29 00:44:14 What Tito Ted Failon is trying to point out is that labor is not merely one component of cost of production. But it is LABOR that gives value to finished goods and commodities. Otherwise everything else are just dead capital, dead machinery and raw materials. @dzmm
291 2018-05-29 00:41:44 But you are only referring to currency. You are not including commodities.
292 2018-05-29 00:02:48 e a classe mérdia brasileira sabe ao menos pq cabrito caga redondo? Não entendendo nem de bosta de cabrito, iria entender de soberania nacional, commodities, golpe, etc, de que jeito?
